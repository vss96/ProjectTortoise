Locate emergency exits.\r\n2. Walk the route to at least one of the exits from where you'll be in the building.\r\n\r\nThe guy basically said this was a pain in the ass to do, but taking 5 minutes to do it really improved your chances of escaping a burning building.\r\n\r\nI can't say I follow it religiously (ie the walking part) when I go into a restaurant, but I definitely do it when I go to a hotel.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12847-b5da981d-9bda-4399-b280-f72e1aa416bb-1566236762"}

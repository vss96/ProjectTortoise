{"controversiality":0,"body":"The economist has a really good article talking about what it means to the US economy but it's private unfortunately.  Basically it’s good and bad.  \r\n\r\nThe bad is that consumers in the US won’t be able to afford to buy as much because anything that we import will be more expensive as well as any product we can export.   This raise in the cost of most goods will cause some inflation as the service sector will increase the cost of their services to pay their employees a bit more to deal with the inflation, which will cause some unemployment as wages rise.  \r\n\r\nThe good is that we may move away from oil as it gets more expensive.  We will also expand our manufacturing base as our US products become much more competitive on the world market.  Many of the companies that have downsized over the years or exported part of the labor may bring it back to a certain extent.  So there will be more jobs unfortunately it takes time to get plants up and back online so we may have several years of high unemployment as certain jobs transfer from service to manufacturing. \r\n\r\nWhat it means to China and Europe is different, they will have their own pains from this.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t4dt","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1164989746,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Fountainhead","id":"ct8ne","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct7b7","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807492,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1373-1cef2c28-9cca-4ea6-ab3f-b85c5cbeef91-1566236758"}

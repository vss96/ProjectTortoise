But most governments work on the principle that one country does not generally enforce another country's tax laws. Tax treaties are often about exchange of information - ie what one tax authority knows all tax authorities know, and double taxation, so you can get out of paying income tax in two countries, and just pay the highest rate.\r\n\r\nAs for whether you'll get a knock on the door for tax arrears in the US, it depends on the country in question. In a US-friendly country like Britain you might, but in more independently-minded countries like France, Germany, Switzerland or Austria probably not.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v69d","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36910-e7dd7764-776c-4568-ad42-f0811903f44b-1566236772"}

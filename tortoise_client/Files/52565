I don't really feel like going through it step by step, but here goes:\r\n\r\nScience seeks to find answers to the holes in human knowledge. Religion provides answers that ask for no further investigation. Science encourages (and even requires) constant questioning; religion discourages it. If it weren't for science, we'd be living in the stone age (well, maybe the bronze age). If religion had it's way, nothing would ever change.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as science delves down into the cracks in human knowledge, it gives names to things it discovers along the way. Perhaps, reason can be seen as a taxonomy of everything. Religion drills down to a certain level of knowledge and assigns everything below the name \"God\". When religion is proven wrong, the definition of \"God\" is slightly narrowed. Religion is constantly back-peddling. Science is constantly growing.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165434347,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctvmh","parent_id":"t1_ctv0f","author_flair_text":null,"author":"radrik","retrieved_on":1473807922,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12176-29d28978-be07-460c-8057-f1549104a3dd-1566236761"}

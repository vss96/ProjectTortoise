I traveled in Japan for two weeks last month and bought many sandwiches.  Most sell for around $2.00.  None of them were ripoffs like the one in this photo, rather they were nice and thin and they were all I needed at the time.  Quality varies for sure, and this one was the low quality.  If I got one of these, I'd march back in to the store and demand a refund.  And in Japan, capital of customer service, you'd get one.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165879153,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cuhza","parent_id":"t3_ugkh","author":"weegee","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808343,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23525-e0ec48fd-31b9-488c-843b-db1dfd15f129-1566236766"}

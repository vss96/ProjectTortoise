The author and his relatives have been dead for some decades, as far as I can ascertain, the company that published it was long ago absorbed by some conglomerate, and the book is very hard to find.  I want to preserve and share it because they're fascinating little stories and part of my family's tradition -- fairy tales that are like nothing in Grimm about creatures and situations I've seen nowhere else.  The front of the book says it cannot be reproduced without written permission from the (long-lost) author and/or publisher, though in the present climate that's just assumed to be the case, note or not.  So the book is going to just sit here in my room, falling apart, until someone can convince me that I can even scan and save a copy onto my own computer without committing a felony.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807640,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctgiq","parent_id":"t3_tczy","author_flair_text":null,"author":"xkcd","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5081-a43e56b3-0ec7-4450-bf2f-6481d8bd81cb-1566236759"}

In fact, one of the more obvious criticisms one can level against it is that it does not take the OO paradigm seriously enough and ends up looking like a traditional imperative/procedural language in a lot of ways. Smalltalk is far more object oriented than Java.\r\n\r\nMost of the ridiculousness of Java comes from its verbosity, and very much related to that, the fact that it's strictly typed with types that don't really express all that much under normal use and with no type inference at all. There are lots of other things wrong with it, but the verbosity of programming even the least bit correctly in Java is the major one. If you want to see a language which is very much like Java but doesn't fall prey to most of the criticisms against it, try [Scala](http://scala.epfl.ch/), which was obviously designed by someone who is actually aware of current programming language research. If you're using Java, there's almost no reason why you shouldn't be using Scala, especially as you automatically get access to all Java libraries transparently.\r\n\r\nI also wouldn't really say that Haskell takes functional programming to a ridiculous extreme in the same way that, say, programming in the lambda calculus or SK calculus would. If you want, you can even program in an entirely imperative way using nothing but the IO monad in Haskell, and it's not even all that difficult -- Haskell has even been half-jokingly referred to as \"the finest imperative language of our time\". So I'm not really sure what you're referring to there.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_utqb","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30503-93a99c68-f98f-4f86-890a-12694ab51e1b-1566236769"}

I couldn't install XP on it because when you press F6 to install third-party drivers, they MUST be on the A: drive, but the machine doesn't have a floppy and the drivers are on a CD anyway.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why Windows install is still so primitive. Why can't I use the mouse? Why can't it be GUI driven instead of everything happening in an extremely rigid sequence? Why can't there just be multiple apps when you boot that let you do things like set up the drivers, format and partition the disk how you want, etc. Other OSs do this, why can't Windows?\r\n\r\nLike many developers, my bread and butter comes from MS's platform. But I hate that their products continue to come up short in many ways compared to  the offerings of their competitors.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wjvh","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809756,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"funkah","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wjvh","id":"cwkmg","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60696-f1980cb5-9414-461e-b797-0e7d63be694a-1566236780"}

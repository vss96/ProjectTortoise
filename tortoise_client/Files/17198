Java tries to with JSF, but as usual makes a huge mess of it.\r\n\r\nPersonally I kinda like this approach, but it's an absolute non-starter if you *do* have a UI designer.  No web designer wants to learn Haskell when they've spent all this time learning the nuances of HTML.  And as you mentioned, you can't use normal HTML editors or load intermediate results into a browser without running the software, which is a real productivity drain on a multi-person project.\r\n\r\nIf I were developing a language &amp; platform, I'd want this sort of data-structure access to be available to the programmer, but with a preprocessor that lets you write in (X)HTML and compile to the language's internal data structure.  I think WASH used to work this way, but the HTML compiler wasn't being maintained and didn't work last time I tried it.  Unfortunately it's pretty difficult to do right, since (regular) HTML has a lot of dark corners and lenient parses, and you'd probably want to run it through Tidy or something before trying to compile it.","retrieved_on":1473809387,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cw0zk","parent_id":"t1_cw0sg","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nostrademons","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50568-5f2db5fb-7128-4047-98f7-502df41f1bc0-1566236778"}

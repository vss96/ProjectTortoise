{"body":"I've driven a variety of GM automobiles via rentals through Avis, and those experiences have convinced me never to set foot in a GM dealership. I look forward to driving my Jetta TDI each day, but dread the thought of getting stuck with GM rental cars. Across the board, their cars' visibility is hampered by small windows and a high beltline, the seats lack lower back support, the suspension gets weak kneed in tight maneuvers, and the interior seems cheap. GM's engineers have somehow figured out how to suck the fun of something that should be an enjoyable experience. There's a connection with the road that's completely missing.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wi17","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167544278,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":11,"score":11,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Stubb","parent_id":"t1_cwioq","id":"cwirn","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809721,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59731-931513a0-f297-411c-9c46-1062a334cffd-1566236780"}

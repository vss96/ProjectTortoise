Though he mentioned it incidentally to one of his other points, I think this deserves it's own spot light.  No sounds should EVER come from a web page automatically unless it's on a band's website.  If I hear any sound coming from my computer that I didn't initiate myself by clicking a play button, then I immediately find the offending page and close it in disgust without ever reading a word.  Who's the genius who thought it was a good idea to add music to a web page?  Lots of times you load a page in a tab, but the music will make you kill that tab and skip their site.  Even if you put up with their page's music, as soon as you click to go to a different page even on their own site then the music stops.  I could go on and on about how many things are wrong with having music automatically play in a web page, but I don't have to, because I'm sure you've all \"enjoyed\" this \"feature\" just as I much as I have.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tq3y","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165403551,"score":6,"ups":6,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11230-642cf32e-ff1e-40c1-a2f9-f091dbaab63b-1566236761"}

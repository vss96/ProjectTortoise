Mr. Baker says he received $450,000 for the unit, which he had bought for just $160,000 in 1997. Since unloading the condo, he and his wife, Helene Jorgensen, also an economist, have been renting an apartment nearby for about $2,300 a month.\r\n\r\nWow you predicted the housing bubble from a mile away and decided to rent after \"unloading\" your condo for close to three time the value in 7 years.

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Yeah, the article was nothing but baseless assumptions.  The author is convinced from the start that service providers will be uninterested in selling an iPhone.  It may be the case that many are apathetic.  I don't know.\r\n\r\nHowever, the author gives no indication that he knows either.  His assumption is based on another assumption, that the iPhone's features will be less than those of its competitors.  He sees iphone as simply an ipod with some calling functionality.  This is, of course, purely conjecture.\r\n\r\nI'd be surprised if service providers aren't creaming their pants at the though of carrying an phone with the functionality of iPod.  I'd be surprised if apple doesn't give it all of the features one expects from a phone these days (camera, mms, bluetooth).  Hell, there is even conjecture at this point that they are working on an embedded OSX.  That thought has to carry as much weight as this fool's rubbish.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vu7u","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166936938,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dwils27","id":"cvwae","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vu7u","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809297,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48194-440085ab-2590-41f6-ab24-943d0d373319-1566236777"}

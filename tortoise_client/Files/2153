There are many people here in Texas who have full US citizenship that participate in government, hold jobs, and generally contribute to the wealth of the community yet do not speak English. I'm not just talking about native Spanish speakers, [either](http://www.censusscope.org/us/s48/chart_language.html). \r\n\r\nSuppose the US government were to collapse and Texas became its own country. Would it be right for the new nation of Texas to deny representation to hundreds of thousands -perhaps millions- of people (of which many were born in Texas and have lived their entire lives here) who had previously enjoyed all the rights and benefits of citizenship of the United States and the State of Texas, simply because they do not speak English? Even if English were a dying language, I don't think it would be an excuse.\r\n\r\nEstonia is guilty of the same linguistic authoritarianism as the USSR. How hard would it have been, and how much damage would it have done to their attempt to revive their language, for Estonia to have made Estonian the offical language of government and commerce, but allow citizenship to all who were residents at the time of their new government's formation?\r\n\r\nI think perhaps the author's opinion in this matter is skewed by his infatuation with Estonia's otherwise cool free-market liberalism.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v7fq","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":3,"score":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166493211,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37327-e8840332-db46-4284-93fa-a74dd2cc6b72-1566236772"}

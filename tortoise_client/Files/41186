What is your answer to the disparity in terms of individuals ability to legally protect and defend their information vs the ability of corporations to do the same? Why is my financial info owned by the credit profilers and I have to beg them to (maybe if they want to) correct it? Why are my cells and their commercial applications owned by UC et al?\r\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=6474185&amp;dopt=Abstract\r\n\r\nWhy does choicepoint get to profit from dossiers about every American whether the info is accurate or not - whether it ruins a job opportunity or not?\r\n\r\nThe only way I see to level the playing field between corporate citizens rights to information and human citizens - is to allow us the same rights they have. They can copyright and trademark and patent all their \"personal\" corporate info and are pushing for their ability to copyright simple lists of facts (HR 3261 - I don't know the current status of this bill or similar EU proposals). We are unique creative products of our heritage, DNA and life circumstances and history.\r\n\r\nWhy is that such an outlandish suggestion - I think it fits perfectly with the intent of the founders. My guess is that they would say that our personal info and DNA are what they meant to protect in the 4th amendment. But we are pretty far afield from the intentions of the founders perhaps because we can't remember the details of the tyranny they were fighting against - for instance, they probably remember why the Magna Carta sought to ensure the right to free travel.","link_id":"t3_usqe","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166176598,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30078-756725b0-889e-480d-aadd-e03bd5cce3f0-1566236769"}

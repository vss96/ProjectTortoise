To quote from the site's \"about\" page: \"HTML Dog has been dishing out healthy code treats since 2003, and currently serves up around 1,500,000 page views a month. The idea is to take the somewhat convoluted official specs for XHTML and CSS and present them in a much more readable fashion\". Since this is a book review and not a website review, I will endeavour to read HTML Dog as a single entity (for the moment, anyway) and see how it stands up on its own (four) legs.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v4k1","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34147-37642a5d-cbcd-46ce-a4a7-e27ee7bd8202-1566236771"}

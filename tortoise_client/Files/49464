All of these involve \"so close I couldn't see their headlights\" tailgaters.\r\n\r\n1) I was was in a construction zone - double fine, no less, and this guy was practically in my back seat.  The construction suddenly switched from the left side of the median to the right.  I drove straight at the curb and swerved at the last second.  I looked back in time to see all the pretty sparks from his oilpan scraping the curb as he straddled it.  He was stuck on the median for a good while.\r\n\r\n2) I was in the left lane on the Interstate, because the left lane was the exit lane from I-XX to I-YY.  Of course somebody was riding my ass.  There was a refrigerator box sitting in the middle of the lane.  I couldn't slam my brakes and stop in time, because the asshole would have rear-ended me.  Luckily the adjacent lane was empty.  I swerved over, but he hit the box dead center.  Unfortunately it was empty.  He didn't tailgate me after that.\r\n\r\n3) An acquaintance of mine was tailgating someone, trying to push him to go faster.  Suddenly the car in front of him changed lanes.  Revealing a car stopped in his lane.  Two broken legs and torn knee ligaments were his price.\r\n\r\nIn summary, tailgaters are idiots.  Our genome would be much improved if they would just all die in fiery crashes.","score":18,"ups":18,"created_utc":1166672625,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42488-eea949ac-41b7-47b8-a9f8-f4c4868c000a-1566236774"}

Legally they are eligible for all the positions reserved for women.\r\n\r\nIn the past and even at present there are many transgenders who have sucessfully won the offices of Mayors, State legislatures; always in areas where they are a huge minority. This is on their public image of being non-corrupt as they have no family for which they would like to be corrupt. In India all the corrupt do make money this way just for their families. Recently, there was a public survey that also indicated that most people think that corrupt people are corrupt for their family. In this society having no family has its own strength.\r\n\r\n Transgenders have a huge community but dont have a family in the traditional sense. A few trans come together and live under the dictat of one senior Guru trans. This group calls themselves a family. A few families have their common big Guru and so on. This pyramid does not go to the top. Somewhere after 4-5 Guru Steps it stops. Thus there are more than one Top Gurus. Each of them have his/her own big family. At times these different groups fight/compete against eachother. Usually these are territory disputes as all these groups have clearly marked territories.  They have big seminars once every few years at various locations. Only trans are allowed in there. Their life and activities and groups and gurus are shrouded by stringent secracy. They dont reveal anything about them to non-trans. And their world is a matter of gossip and mystery stories among the general indian population. An estimate puts their population is more than 3 million. Almost all of them dress as females. Their main source of livlihood is entertaining people by singing and dancing. But TV has been taking away their business so quite a few engage in prostitution.\r\n\r\nTransgender associations in India are getting their act together to raise Shanthi's case. Normally, whenever any kid is born anywhere in India they visit him/her and if the kid is naturally born trans they force the parents to give the kid to them and they are almost successful as their parents also realsize that the kids have a poor future living in theit own family and probably have better life living with these trans people. But sometimes parents device some schemes and hide their kids from these trans groups. I guess Shanthi was one of those few kids that have been hidden.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vn5g","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809149,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vn5g","id":"cvoi8","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44235-8f0bedc5-9872-4076-bd6e-5d6a3b08f484-1566236774"}

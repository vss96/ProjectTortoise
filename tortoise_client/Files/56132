If you think the other person *might* have one, good to have a gun. If you're sure they won't... well damn. Definitely have one then, they won't have a chance in hell. As for the \"they'll know they'll get a longer sentence\" that's already the case and doesn't seem to be a deterrent. Then again, over here you have them murdering witnesses just because they've learned it's the better risk to take.\r\n\r\n&gt; Yes I'm sure that's true but I don't think the two are related. Britain also has an increasingly widespread drugs problem which brings with it greater use of firearms.\r\n\r\nHow is that possible, I thought they banned the things. Didn't all firearms magically dissolve into fairy dust and angel dreams as soon as the legislation took effect?\r\n\r\n&gt; That ban only covered guns which were used in shooting clubs anyway, as far as I know. \r\n\r\nAh, well at least you outlawed the menace of hobbyist target shooting. Paper targets can rest safe nowdays, knowing they won't be gunned down on the way to the grocery store.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165776172,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20472-89ff4804-aab5-457e-b226-fbddc38d17c5-1566236765"}

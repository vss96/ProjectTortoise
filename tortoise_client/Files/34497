{"controversiality":0,"body":"I could make more money elsewhere, but I don't want to- I'm not starving, so I'd rather do what I am doing. And I still do give money to charities. It may be because of my church background, but I consistently give 10+% of my money away.\r\n\r\nMost charities don't need more money, they need more man power- dedicated volunteers and staff. I honestly believe that I do better for my charity working (and volunteering) for it than I would just giving it money. Charities can run, at least for a time, without money but not without people.\r\n\r\nAs for the word exorbitant, how can you say that if you don't even know what I do are what kind of lifestyle I live in?\r\n\r\nAs for responsible, the people who donate to me know where every dollar they give goes. That seems responsible to me. And eventhough I oversee volunteers, there are also have volunteers who oversee me- out board, which except for ex-officio members is made up of volunteers, is my boss- it supervises and approves our budget and has full power to fire staff.\r\n\r\nAnd I do believe that volunteers are more important than staff. I volunteered for three years before going on staff (and I still volunteer 10+/week), and the first thing I did when I started getting paid was make sure that I began volunteering elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to support a charity like mine (do you support any charities? And if you do, how much time do you give to them) I respect that. But don't accuse me of being an irresponsible thief if you have no reason to.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u89o","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165694235,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"aardvarkious","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu9b4","id":"cu9fg","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808181,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18898-ad2adc86-608b-4f9a-ba0a-e4e391ff845b-1566236764"}

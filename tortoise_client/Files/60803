If everyone drove Honda Civics instead of Ford Explorers, that would cut transportation oil consumption in half.  If everyone carpooled to work with *one* other friend, that would cut it in half again.  If 20% of people telecommuted to work, that would cut another 20%.  If everyone turned off their lights and computers when not in use, that would cut electricity expenditures in half (though much of the electricity in the U.S. is generated from coal).\r\n\r\nIn the short run (months, weeks or days), it wouldn't be pretty, largely because Americans' first reaction to high gas prices is to blame the oil companies.  But over a couple of years (which was the amount of time Britain took to get over the Great Depression), people would adjust, lifestyles would change, and the economy would start to recover.","link_id":"t3_vc4j","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43051-b09aade7-ca6f-4a03-a905-a1c0963874de-1566236774"}

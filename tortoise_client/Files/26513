{"controversiality":0,"body":"I think it is more accurate to say that America was founded on a variety of different ideas and ideals, among them a general greco-roman heritage expressed through an affinity for reason and Greek and Roman history, from which much of the basis for our government is derived. Furthermore, American was deeply Christian at the time of the founding, and most Americans were very used to a congregational form of church government, which  is truly a very democratic form of church government. The government was founded as a republic, yet the people were already in a democratic society because of the values derived from the church. Case in point, look at the Mayflower Compact, a document which presaged the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution, and which was written by extremely religious people.","link_id":"t3_vx6w","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167027101,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvynd","id":"cvytj","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809345,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49496-1139a23f-b74e-4333-b5cf-39ffc193266e-1566236777"}

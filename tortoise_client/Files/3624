Terrorism should be treated more seriously. I have been a girlfriend of many terrorist men. Have been involved with Hassan al Turabi, who is one of the most terrible man. I was an actress in Northern Africa, and I got to know many of those powerful men who hate the West. All they want is to blow up London, blow up Warsaw and all western cities. They believe that this kind of terrorism will frighten everybody in the West, put them on their knees and make them do what they want to be done. I heard al Turabi, who then was a vice-president of Sudan, talking about killing a million people by water poisoning. They are very determined and if they can't have the nuclear power the West has, they are going to have biological and chemical weapons and use them. This is what I want the West to understand !\"","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808852,"gilded":0,"id":"cv943","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v83w","author":"goo321","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36446-a5a0d2e4-8aea-437d-b4fa-26df58ea52c9-1566236772"}

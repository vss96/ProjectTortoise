{"body":"Do you really need photoshop and Visual Studio, or will work-a likes work?   In the former case you are stuck with Windows forever.     In the latter though, Krita/Gimp, and Kdevelop are coming along nicely.    I'm not artistic enough to comment on photoshop replacements, but I can tell you that kdevelop beats the snot out of Visual Stuido 6 (the only version I have access to, I'm well aware that it is many years out of date, but I'm not qualified to talk about latter versions).   I still prefer emacs, but to each their own.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vs61","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166860922,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"bluGill","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvtkt","edited":false,"id":"cvtta","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809250,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47019-59be6e38-7db4-42e7-8e5b-7d7c58063eb2-1566236775"}

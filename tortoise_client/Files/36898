They person I just described is deceiving no one. They have honestly seen evidence and they have honest intentions in spreading it.\r\n\r\nJust because you have never seen evidence of God, don't be so quick to assume that others haven't. That is a very arrogant position to take.","retrieved_on":1473809162,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvp55","parent_id":"t1_cvor3","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44584-9da9a77d-3f70-49ef-bfb8-642096726323-1566236774"}

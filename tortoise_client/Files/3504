Most hallucinogens are non-toxic, which can't be said about, say, alcohol.  There's an interesting measurement for drugs, the ratio of the effective dose to the lethal dose: \r\n\r\n\"The most toxic recreational drugs, such as GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) and heroin, have a lethal dose less than 10 times their typical effective dose. The largest cluster of substances has a lethal dose that is 10 to 20 times the effective dose: These include cocaine, MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine, often called \"ecstasy\") and alcohol. A less toxic group of substances, requiring 20 to 80 times the effective dose to cause death, include Rohypnol (flunitrazepam or \"roofies\") and mescaline (peyote cactus). The least physiologically toxic substances, those requiring 100 to 1,000 times the effective dose to cause death, include psilocybin mushrooms and marijuana, when ingested. I've found no published cases in the English language that document deaths from smoked marijuana, so the actual lethal dose is a mystery. My surmise is that smoking marijuana is more risky than eating it but still safer than getting drunk.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/50773?&amp;print=yes","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vdx0","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808963,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"karcass","id":"cveyi","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvexn","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39403-8bf4865d-051f-408f-8b53-8bbaabfb3249-1566236773"}

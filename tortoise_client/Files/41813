You know, I think we felt less fright and more a sense of \"this might be it\". It was surreal. \r\nFor me personally, I felt a combination of sadness and anger afterwards. It seems to come up when I least expect it. A few days after the attack, it seemed that everybody was bringing \"grief counselors\" into offices and elsewhere to help people deal with it. I was skeptical and cynical about the enterprise. It seemed like people were coming out of the woodwork, professing to be able to help everybody. Like everybody else, my office brought somebody in. I sat there listening to him and wondering what qualified him to \"counsel\" us about something he'd never experienced any more than we did. I really wanted to tell him he's a fraud  and leave. But all of a sudden, he started reading a psalm: \"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...\". I looked out the window, saw the smoking ruins of the Trade Center, and had to rush out of the room so twenty other people didn't see me crying. I didn't expect that to happen, but it did. Even today I sometimes feel it in a way that goes far beyond the generalized public discussions, and usually when I least expect it. Thank you again.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ua9w","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21990-e216f44d-53b7-4cca-b088-a1077aa96f46-1566236766"}

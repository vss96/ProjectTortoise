Amoral is a more neutral, impartial word meaning 'without, or not concerned with, moral standards.' An immoral person commits acts that violate societyâ€™s moral norms. An amoral person has no understanding of these norms, or no sense of right and wrong; the word may refer to a 'social deviant.' Amoral may also mean 'not concerned with, or outside the scope of morality' (following the pattern of apolitical, asexual). Amoral, then, may refer to a judicial ruling that is concerned only with narrow legal or financial issues. Whereas amoral may be simply descriptive, immoral is judgmental.\r\n\r\nThe tiny little article doesn't go into enough detail, but *amoral* doesn't seem correct considering what the article is about. Maybe I'm wrong.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tdr4","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165105236,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4091-8e5294fa-852d-43cf-a78b-1649b56caeee-1566236759"}

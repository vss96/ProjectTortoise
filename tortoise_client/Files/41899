If you read the emails, they seem to indicate that the newest emails are at the bottom (exemplified by the lotto email and the sktbrdr7 email). The scrollbar, however, seems to indicate that we are at the top, and that the newest emails are also at the top.\r\n\r\nOne solution to this would be that we are indeed at the top and the newer emails are at the bottom, which would indicate that phoebe773@aol.com is the first of the 3,451,893,495 messages. However, it would be statistically improbable for 18 of the 87 unread emails to be in the first 24 emails. That would mean that 21% of the new emails are in a space that occupies (7^(-11))% of all the messages and that this space includes the first of all God's emails.\r\n\r\nUnless, of course, God is like a tachyon and reads his emails backwards through time.","link_id":"t3_txkn","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807996,"distinguished":null,"author":"veracitas","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctzjj","parent_id":"t3_txkn","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13850-7b8f2793-ef99-4d62-9096-aa0d7f5f43f4-1566236762"}

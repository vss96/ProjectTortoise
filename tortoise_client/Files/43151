Many of these companies tell you they will know if the phone line is cut. Technically, thats true, as all alarm panels are programmed to report in at a specified interval. But it's usually once a week, sometimes once a month. If alarm companies had thousands and thousands of alarm systems calling in all day every day, they wouldn't have the \"bandwidth\" left to receive actual alarm signals! So there is no way they're going to know immediately if the line is cut.  Not only that, most phone lines in newer homes come into the home underground, anyway. And if your phone line comes in outside the house, you can easily protect it with pvc or steel piping, that you can buy at a hardware store for about $2.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808149,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":1467224715.0,"id":"cu7po","parent_id":"t1_clzkc","author_flair_text":null,"author":"adleym","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"18054-f11d4880-d31c-49e4-92f0-1a10bb080416-1566236763"}

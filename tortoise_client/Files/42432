I'm not sure if it's always this way, but after the sex scandals started happening, I started noticing that priests are never presented as clean people. Every priest you see in a movie either (a) eats young women (Sin City), (b) self-flagellates himself (The Fountain or The Da Vinci Code), (c) kills people in the name of religion in order to achieve political power (Sin City, The Fountain), or is in some way a corrupt and hypocritical bastard (Stigmata). I did a little bit of googling and found [this](http://www.austindiocese.org/newsletter_article_view.php?id=503), although the source is from the Church itself so it maybe slightly biased. The last sympathetic priests I can remember are probably Keep The Faith and The Exorcist. Overall, it's a been a while since a priest has just been a nice guy. It's not actually as bad as it looks.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uz4h","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808729,"author":"carpeliam","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv1ru","id":"cv2m7","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33163-3132988f-41fa-44e1-adaa-b0b6ad8a6dd6-1566236770"}

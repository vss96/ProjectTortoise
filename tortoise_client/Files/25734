Many like to promote the fashionable idea that being an active citizen is easy; just show up and vote for some leader, or sit around hoping the powerful will solve the world's problems.\r\n\r\nAs for your other claim, if you claim Chomsky or Einstein (to take names you likely know) just \"wave a sign around,\" then you seem to be at a disadvantage in terms of knowing what effective activists actually do. And they did more than activism too; if Gates wrote a \"useful computer program,\" those two revolutionized scientific fields.\r\n\r\nThat's like saying Einstein was only famous for writing a popular intro to relativity.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tcs0","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165111460,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":-2,"score":-2,"author":"tayssir","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cteip","parent_id":"t1_ctehd","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807602,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4251-e93ff7c4-4857-426a-ac08-5b6cd4819408-1566236759"}

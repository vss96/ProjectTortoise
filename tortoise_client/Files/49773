It's quite a bit more than simply replacing the label.  Your watch example isn't accurate.  It would be more akin to the msrp watch mfr selling them the parts to the watch, them putting it together and selling it as theirs.\r\n\r\nSimply scratching out the name and putting their own name on literally would mean taking the packaged chocolate and only changing the labeling.  This is obviously not happening.\r\n\r\nAside from remolding the chocolate, they also make other candies out of it as well, which destroys your example even more so.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, it's entirely probably that noka has the mfr make the chocolate specifically to their recipe.  This would be like telling a watch mfr to make their watches to a specific design with specific features, and then rebranding that.\r\n\r\nNothing at all wrong with these things, especially if people will pay for it.  If you don't like it, don't buy it.  I wouldn't.","link_id":"t3_wb48","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809696,"distinguished":null,"author":"nosoupforyou","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwgtu","id":"cwhe5","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59014-4c648010-efc1-40bb-836a-e9ac1ecd17c7-1566236780"}

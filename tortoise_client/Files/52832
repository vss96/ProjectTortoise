If you believe that, I've got some waterfront property in Washington D.C. for sale. What's really going to happen is that the Republican earmarks will simply be replaced with Democratic ones. Are we really supposed to believe that politicians are going to stop using federal tax money to buy votes? Dream on.\r\n\r\n&gt;And don't forget the irony of Robert Byrd...the king of the earmark, actually saying no more earmarks will be allowed. This is a man who if it weren't for Ted Stevens in Alaska, he would be the undisputed, all-time leader in pork barrel spending. Ever been to West Virginia? Everything is named after Robert Byrd. \r\n\r\nCourtesy of my favorite [libertarian.](http://boortz.com/nuze/200612/12122006.html#pork)","link_id":"t3_ukxm","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808447,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cunm6","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ukxm","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26261-b6480bd4-abf0-4ae8-a7df-f50328716cf8-1566236767"}

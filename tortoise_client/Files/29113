{"body":"That picture is impossible, given known physics.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, whoever created it isn't very good at physics. Nice idea though. See, the problem is that he depicts gravity sloping in two directions... up the sides of the wall, and along the torus.\r\n\r\nA REAL rotating torus only produces centrifugal force along the axis of rotation... in other words, everyone in those buildings on either side of the river would be sliding down the slope, because only the water would be level.\r\n\r\nOr, think of it another way... imagine a giant rotating cylinder. The axis of rotation is down the center of the cylinder... like Arther C Clark's 'Rama'. And of course, the walls of the cylinder are flat... it's not shaped like a football, and nobody would expect it to be.\r\n\r\nBut take that cylinder, and make it shorter. Make it really short... heck, shape it like a really SHORT cylinder, like a penny... a circular coin is just a really short and fat cylinder. Guess what you have? Larry Niven's 'Ringworld'. And there were no sloping sides in Ringworld because physics doesn't work like that.\r\n\r\nSo the artist gets an A for effort, but a D for realism. It's a very pretty idea, but if you're gonna paint Sci-Fi, try to mix in a little Sci with your Fi.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_taej","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165886959,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"MyrddinE","id":"cuifc","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_taej","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808352,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23786-dd9488b3-e270-4d01-9769-4b9e26bc719b-1566236767"}

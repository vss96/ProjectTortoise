The Amish do not take government handouts of any kind.  They are very self-reliant and have been for generations.  If one of them struggles, everyone lends a helping hand.  They don't need the government giving them a handout just because it makes the agency look bad.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother grew up in Pennsylvania Dutch country and interacted with the Amish often.  She took many of their values and passed them on to her children who passed them on to theirs.  I still practice many of the ideals we think are good among the Amish.\r\n\r\nThe Amish are not malnourished.  If you've ever been to an Amish market, you'd see that they are selling their surplus food.  They've taken care of what they need, canned it, etc., and the rest is taken to market to sell.\r\n\r\nThey aren't poor and have many resources to keep them going but the agency doesn't want to hear this.  They don't want to know how the Amish live, they're just worried about their bottom line and how much trouble they're going to get into.\r\n\r\nWhatever happened to being happy that people are doing well and don't need governement assistance?","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809533,"gilded":0,"id":"cw8p3","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w6zc","author_flair_text":null,"author":"berberine","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54722-47c541ba-458d-4013-95ce-95d267871db1-1566236779"}

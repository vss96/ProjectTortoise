Both look down on the blogs. They all say \"trust me\" \"I do research\" \"I find and interpret what is important\" \"I am a knight in shining armour\".\r\n\r\nYet when it comes down to it they are all story tellers, weaving myth from the dirty, grey facts. People are more interested in stories, they sell better and in the end journalists decend in a long lineage from Homer - less about the fact, more about the feeling.\r\n\r\nIf today's print journalists are not telling the enticing, enthralling stories that will capture the imagination of the public - then there is no need to weep for them. The stories will still come to today's world, with the same about of embellishment, but from other places instead of the dead tree scrolls.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w4wf","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167242112,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53319-b77860ba-76a5-4eb8-8d4e-7c4abd4ad9df-1566236778"}

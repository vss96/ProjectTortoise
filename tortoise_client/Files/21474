{"controversiality":0,"body":"Yes, but what if their staff is how they do charitable work and their donors know they are paying for mostly salary?\r\n\r\nIn the city I live in, I know of many charities (including the one I work for) that spend most of their budget on salaries. This is because most of their resources are spent on training and supporting volunteers, which staff are needed for. In the charities I know of like this, the staff aren't getting paid exhorbently either- they could make way more in the private sector, and sometimes they don't get paid for several months because there isn't enough money (atleast in the one I work for, I'm the last person to  get paid: all of our programs are funded before my rent is). The salaries are not such a large part of the budget because of greed, I assure you.\r\n\r\nAlso, often these charities spend such a large portion of their budget on salaries because their other costs are usually pretty small since they are given gifts-in-kind instead of donations often. For example, the charity I work for does not need to raise money for computers because we always get them donated to us. And often our programs cost us around half of what they should because of generous businesses.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that there aren't charities out there that are unresponsible with their money. I'm just saying that it isn't always a bad thing if they do spend most of their money on salaries, as long as donours know this is the case.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u89o","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165689611,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"aardvarkious","parent_id":"t1_cu8mm","edited":false,"id":"cu975","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808177,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18774-7a9b84a8-eb80-4130-a7cb-1a5c850fe480-1566236764"}

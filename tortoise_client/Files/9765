You've also caused alot of animosity that wasn't there before... which will have to be overcome by whoever really does discover what the answers are.\r\n\r\nAssuming that itself isn't the problem, the concept that there are some ultimate answers waiting to be discovered.\r\n\r\n&gt; If you look at the historical justification of wars (Crusades, Islamic Conquests, Israel-Palestine etc.) many of them were religious wars. Religion is a huge part of wars...\r\n\r\nYou're very naive. Unimaginative. And nothing I say seems to be encouraging you to think carefully. You've already got all your answers pre-canned, certain that yours is the path that will set the world free and save many people, if not everyone. You even hint that wars won't be fought any longer, if people just see the light.

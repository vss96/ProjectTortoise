Also, why are you cyberstalking me?  I find it a *bit* creepy you pull out 3 month-old personal blog posts on me.  Where's your site, bud?  O right ... I don't cyberstalk you.\r\n\r\nAnd, when I used the term \"mutual fund\" I used it loosely.  They merely purchase shares of my portfolio, you see.  Say I have $1,000; some one adds $100 to the pot, in effect making me a trustee of it.  I would invest this in long positions in highly-lucrative foreign markets that are not depreciating like the USD.  Let's say after 30 days, my portfolio has increased to $1,200.  that's a 8.3% increase over the $1,100.  Should they cash out, they would collect 7.5% (90% of the profit), or $107.5 dollars.\r\n\r\nIt's like you loaned your friend money to buy tickets and he sold them for $20 over face and gave you $18 dollars back.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vdbm","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808992,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"hopeseekr","edited":false,"id":"cvgec","parent_id":"t1_cvg2m","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40249-f5f74bff-eee0-429b-8ed8-06940812e635-1566236773"}

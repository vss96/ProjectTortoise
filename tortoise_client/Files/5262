Food is AMAZINGLY cheap by historic standards.\r\n\r\n4 hours of minimum wage labor should buy you around 20 pounds of rice -- good for a month probably. A day's work should buy the rice and a multi-vitamin. Add some bananas, and you're good to go.\r\n\r\nThe charity here would be better spent on Oxfam or some micro-lending initiative.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could make sure to buy clothes made in poor countries like cambodia. Nothing like a seemless wealth transfer from rich westerners to developing countries.\r\n\r\nI suppose you have to think hard to get that warm-fuzzy feeling pretentious folks like about charity.\r\n\r\nThis article and the restaurant are really selling that fuzzy feeling.\r\n\r\nEverything else is just opportunity cost.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w3n5","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809483,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"IKbot","id":"cw61o","parent_id":"t3_w3n5","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53307-e0d4c8d5-c4b1-43e7-bc33-b900e3fb618f-1566236778"}

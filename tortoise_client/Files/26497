Then they talked to white people, and all they cared about were the ukiyo-e (wood block prints) that the Japanese considered pap. You've probably seen \"the Great Wave Off Kanagawa.\" According to my prof, prints like that probably sold for the equivalent of $10 when new -- how much we would pay for a poster of the same thing.\r\n\r\nAny how, the moral is any craft could be an \"art\" in the sense of \"a good art\" if people put the effort into raising it to its highest level, just usually no one does it.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24042-42c8b038-e5bc-4657-ab58-686314d52750-1566236767"}

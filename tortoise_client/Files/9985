What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?\r\n\r\nPrivate Joker: No, sir.\r\n\r\nPogue Colonel: You'd better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit on you.\r\n\r\nPrivate Joker: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nPogue Colonel: Now answer my question or you'll be standing tall before the man.\r\n\r\nPrivate Joker: I think I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir.\r\n\r\nPogue Colonel: The what?\r\n\r\nPrivate Joker: The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.\r\n\r\nPogue Colonel: Whose side are you on, son?\r\n\r\nPrivate Joker: Our side, sir.\r\n\r\nPogue Colonel: Don't you love your country?\r\n\r\nPrivate Joker: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nPogue Colonel: Then how about getting with the program? Why don't you jump on the team and come on in for the big win?\r\n\r\nPrivate Joker: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nPogue Colonel: Son, all I've ever asked of my marines is that they obey my orders as they would the word of God. We are here to help the Vietnamese, because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out. It's a hardball world, son. We've gotta keep our heads until this peace craze blows over.\r\n\r\nPrivate Joker: Aye-aye, sir.","controversiality":0,"score":22,"ups":22,"created_utc":1166310044,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32940-a5d8882f-2539-4590-9531-b2d4fa36d256-1566236770"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"You are supposed to configure your mac a special way to discourage the thief from doing this. What you do is you put a firmware password on your HD, and then you create a guest account with no password. This means you can't wipe the HD without a password. Then, when the thief tries to log in and they click on your account, there is a password. Then they try the guest account and realize it needs no password, so they just use that. If this guy had actually followed the best practices then he probably would have gotten his computer back without his data being wiped.\r\n\r\nActually, it's a good idea to do this even if you don't have this software. At least it makes it more likely that the thief won't mess up your computer if you ever get it back somehow.","link_id":"t3_u8yw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165699627,"score":16,"ups":16,"author":"Alex3917","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cu9np","parent_id":"t1_cu9lo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808185,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19046-7c53d6c6-4e0b-40a1-a994-39707b1798a8-1566236764"}

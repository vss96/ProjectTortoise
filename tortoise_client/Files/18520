In Sweden virtually nothing at Christmas is called something with \"Christ\" in the name. It's Jul (Yule) all the way. Examples:\r\n\r\n* God Jul - Merry Christmas\r\n\r\n* Julgran - Christmas tree\r\n\r\n* Jultomte - Santa Clause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Jultomte\" especially is interesting. Not only does it not contain the \"Santa\" (saint) part of the english word, it's actually a word that's not translatable to english in a literal sense. The closest literal translation for \"Jultomte\" is \"Christmas-gnome\" but it's not a very good one. \r\n\r\nThere's not really an english word (afaik I might add) for \"Tomte\", which in Swedish is a small, bearded man/being who hangs around the house and farm and, as long as being treated good, helps with chores without being noticed.","retrieved_on":1473809307,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vw3w","id":"cvwsg","author_flair_text":null,"author":"cach-e","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48418-b04d7061-1e20-43cf-a722-bb39d539e9a3-1566236777"}

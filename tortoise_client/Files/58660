When I was in college, I played a show with a bunch of friends.  For an encore, we did a half-improvised medley of about a dozen different songs, all over a I-V-IV progression.  Included in it were:\r\n\r\n* Third Eye Blind\r\n* Nellie Fertado (sp?)\r\n* Ludacris\r\n* Jurassic Park\r\n* Phish\r\n* Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony, 3rd movement (I couldn't resist; I'd just played it in orchestra the week before)\r\n\r\nAnd probably a lot of other ones that I've since forgotten.  Even if the song doesn't fit, you can usually change one note in it to make it harmonize, and it'll still sound recognizable to a listener.\r\n\r\nIt's like how Green Day's Basketcase is the same chord progression as Pachelbel's Canon in D (with one chord changed), and you can play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star over both of them, again by changing one note.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tn3v","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9703-217d4288-e3ef-4873-9b88-718dfc45f3d4-1566236761"}

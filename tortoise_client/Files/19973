When I first drank it, I used milk and sugar, and after a few harsh jokes I decided it would save me a headache to drink it black.\r\n\r\nThen I joined the Navy.  Where I continued to drink it straight black, and the coffee got much much stronger too.  Note, they really do cook it all night long.\r\n\r\nOk.  Now I'm a math major in his senior year, and of course I love my coffee.  And up until a few months ago, it has always been straight black.\r\n\r\nBut for years I have noticed that drinking coffee has made me tired.  So last summer I decided not to drink coffee and instead green tea for a few months.  It's not the same.  But I did welcome a change.\r\n\r\nSo when I came back to coffee I decided I would add sugar, and in good amounts, to hopefully stymie off tiredness.  And you know what, it's really worked.  I never crash anymore.  I still have 4 to 8 cups (mugs) a day.  But I do add two tablespoons of natural sugar to each cup (mug).  What's crazier, I even fall to sleep better than I use to too.  \r\n\r\nMy advice, after all this, add sugar to your black coffee.  It takes a few weeks (months) to get use to, but it'll stop that tired feeling cold in its tracks.\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166372422,"ups":10,"score":10,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cv48f","parent_id":"t3_v461","author":"math_man","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808759,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33961-72aa1294-1556-4810-9350-0080757a12eb-1566236771"}

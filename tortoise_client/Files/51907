I only need both hands on the keyboard when I'm actively typing something - for editing, browsing, file manipulation, etc, I have my right hand on the mouse and the left hand over the keyboard for Alt-Tab, Ctrl-X, F6, tab, etc.  A menu item is Alt-Tab Right-click Select, while a command line interface would be Alt-tab \"cvs up\" (or \"!cvs\" if it's last in the history buffer, but that's nearly as long).\r\n\r\nI also refer you to [this](http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html) bit of research that Apple did.  Most developers I know violently disbelieve that study; I've heard many people say \"Tog is wrong.  Of course Apple would find that; they've invested so much time in a mouse-based interface.\"  But try this experiment: when pair programming, who makes you sit and wait more, the keyboard-based programmer or the mouse-based programmer.  When I work with *other* people, I find myself twiddling my thumbs more often with the keyboard-users than the mouse-users.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wg1p","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167575786,"score":0,"ups":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60124-7a9532a5-d0a3-44fc-9bb3-35898cde92d4-1566236780"}

That was supposed to be the idea with the Windows 3.1 Program Manager (Applications, Accessories, Games, etc.), and it always seemed that vendors created new program groups anyways... something about a fetish with wanting to link the help and release notes everywhere. The DMG distribution model also really helps users pick where they want that stuff, if at all.","ups":6,"score":6,"created_utc":1167345282,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cwapu","edited":false,"id":"cwara","author_flair_text":null,"author":"mikepurvis","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809572,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55715-3aff8e66-ea18-4fb3-918d-9b26266f21f1-1566236779"}

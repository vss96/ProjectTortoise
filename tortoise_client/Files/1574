This article is, in fact, an example of it happening.\r\n\r\nThe economic objectives of the person who wrote this article include cheap ink for his or her printer. They are attempting to achieve this by raising awareness of the fact that the company is screwing them over. If it bothers others, then eventually some bright individual will start a company which does not rip off its customers on ink. Or perhaps someone will discover an ingenious way to circumvent the manufacturer-imposed restrictions, and Epson and their ilk will, in order to remain competitive, have to stop charging so much for ink.\r\n\r\n(The way things have been going lately, though, it seems likely that manufacturers may respond to circumvention with a demand for circumvention to be rendered illegal. If that happens, though, then it's no longer a free market and consumers will continue to be ripped off.)\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that free markets don't often have problems, of course, but I don't think that this printer-ink thing is a good example of that.\r\n\r\n*edit: minor stuff for clarity*","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166479478,"ups":2,"score":2,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36900-484c1b46-b235-4847-a667-8133688f1630-1566236772"}

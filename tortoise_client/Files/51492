{"controversiality":0,"body":"You understand it wrongly.\r\n\r\nQuantum field theory is basically the most advanced of all the theories which make up the firmly established bedrock of theoretical physics.  The idea is that you have operator&amp;dagger; fields over spacetime, in a similar way that in classical electromagnetism you have vector fields over spacetime, and in thermodynamics you might have scalar fields over space.  The underlying space on which all of these fields are defined is absolutely not discrete.  This is not a computational approximation, it is a fundamental assumption.\r\n\r\nMaybe quantum field theory isn't correct, and the manifold assumption is not true, but at present this is just pure speculation.\r\n\r\n&amp;dagger; An operator is (more or less) a (possibly infinite dimensional) matrix.","link_id":"t3_vb4k","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166551501,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"acrophobia","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvduh","parent_id":"t1_cvd1e","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808941,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38826-d8553dde-c946-4b85-a1c0-6afb1c7252d1-1566236773"}

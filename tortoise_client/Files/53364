Suppose that you want a program to print out every line of a text file which begins with a two-digit number. The least complex program for this would be written specifically for this case, and it would be a marvel of simplicity. But if you actually want to get the simplest *solution* to the problem, you'd use grep. It would be trivial, at the cost of requiring a full-fledged regular expression engine.\r\n\r\nThe situation is similar for \"kiss\". In order to communicate the concept succinctly, people use the existing word \"kiss\" and thereby avoid a phonetic collision and the added difficulty of remembering what \"kis\" stands for, at the cost of a little extra naming complexity.","link_id":"t3_u3fx","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808120,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"sketerpot","id":"cu66h","parent_id":"t1_cu5kp","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17076-1e8c789d-37a5-401d-82fe-37045ed5481b-1566236763"}

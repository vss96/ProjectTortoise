Which means they didn't approve. Now, maybe they looked the other way and only did something about it when the story got out, but you don't say that.\r\n\r\n&gt; when some kid developed a drug problem (and many did), they were immediately put into rehab (which occasionally helped)\r\n\r\nHow is this bad? How is it worse than criminalizing and expelling them (which is what would happen, if the administration chose to do anything about it, in many public high schools)?\r\n\r\nI went to a private school, too. This may or may not have made a difference, but there was an emphasis on making sure that kids who qualified were able to go there regardless of what their economic background was. I was friends with a girl who lived with plastic bags taped to her window frames, and with the son of a guy who owned a couple of shopping malls. It was a place that cared about teaching, and that's why parents sent their kids there.\r\n\r\nPoint is, if you're the parent of a private school student, you're in a much better position to influence your kid's education than you are in a public school. You can choose which school they go to, and your direct funding of their tuition means that a smaller group of parents has a much larger voice to the governing body.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wdrb","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57794-39a910bb-8c57-4a8d-975f-7fa96acba071-1566236780"}

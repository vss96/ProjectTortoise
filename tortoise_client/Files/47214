But \"expressive\" is not really the first thing that comes to mind here.  I consider the expressiveness of a language to be the ease with which I can say what I want to say, not just that it's possible.  He seems to think C++ meets that criteria but to me it always feels like I'm saying what C++ wants me to say in order to do what I want it to do.  Touchy-feely comment, but I suspect he thinks it's expressive because he hasn't been up to his elbows in some other good languages.","controversiality":0,"ups":3,"score":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166483789,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37051-c34f30e3-4d3a-4ef2-b4e1-b229675f324a-1566236772"}

Even for someone already running XP, who'd want to risk installing a new OS over their existing setup (especially since MS is infamous for releasing beta-quality crap on their first attempt)?\r\n\r\nI honestly don't think MS was trying to bribe the bloggers (at least, not in the sense that they were expecting good reviews due to the monetary value of the systems they sent out). I think the real issue is that they wanted reviews of \"clean systems\". Remember all of the crap problems that arose when people tried upgrading Win 3.11 to Windows 95? Getting a review of a fresh system on guaranteed compatible hardware is what they were paying for. And I'm sure that a blogger who reviews the \"clean system\" rather than an upgraded XP system would have better things to say, but mainly because of problems in the upgrade process rather than because of the bribe factor.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167486411,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58626-d0aaa37d-9d08-47fa-8b9b-a53c76836ff0-1566236780"}

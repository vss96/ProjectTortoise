Rarely in other languages can you turn off some kind of major piece of functionality with a configuration setting.  You can't turn off Java.net.* in Java with a setting but for some reason it's a good idea in PHP.\r\n\r\n\"including a remote PHP script for execution - potentially a major security risk / gotcha if you are not very careful about how you construct the path to the script you want to include.\"\r\n\r\nYou're wrong about \"not very careful\" -- you have to be extremely uncareful for an include() to be a security flaw.  You'd have to be included on user input, no prefixing it with any kind of path, etc.  Those are both extremely rare and/or stupid things to do.  Certainly it was a much bigger problem when register_globals was the default but those days are gone.\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808644,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cuy2w","parent_id":"t1_cuxhr","author":"almostalive","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31145-0b3c34b9-de4d-4d5d-b68b-fa97fb62c95e-1566236769"}

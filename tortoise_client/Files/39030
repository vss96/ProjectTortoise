Now he's so messed up that he needs to be an internet tough guy (and quite possibly a very real beligerent neurotic) in order to feel safe, and competent, and important, and worthwhile. \r\n\r\nNot everyone gets beaten on, of course.\r\n\r\nBut there's lots of ways of being scarred. I have an IQ of 173 (No, really. I'm not kidding.), and I'm just applying to grad school at age 33. I won't go into all the grisly details, but I should be ten years into my scientific career(and angling for a Turing Award), not struggling to start it.\r\n\r\nI talk to younger people who were home-schooled, or allowed to attend college at 14 after taking the GED, and they're so  far ahead of where I was at their age, so much more confident. And I'm happy for them, I'm glad this is happening, but inside I'm twisted up with envy, because I'm scared that I may be beyond fixing, that I'll never have as much confidence, as much follow-through, as much ability to turn talent into actual results, as they do. \r\n\r\nI'm sorry, I didn't mean to turn this into a personal screed, but please, if you have kids, don't shovel them into that furnace.","retrieved_on":1473809497,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cw6t6","parent_id":"t1_cw69y","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Whisper","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53735-f19e31cc-0089-4581-b380-1ebc99a7dd6e-1566236778"}

Show me the company that is willing to provide every American college student with student loans that are below market value. Go ahead, I'll wait. Cause if you come back to me with a non-profit, I'll show you a non-profit that is too limited in scope to provide that service. If you come back to me with a for-profit bank, I'll show you a bank director/ceo/cfo that is in serious trouble for violating his fiduciary responsibility. \r\n\r\nMore efficiently? At a better quality? We could argue that indefinetely. My healthcare is private and it sucks. I have to wait months to see my doctor unless I'm dying. Anytime there is a problem with my insurance, I have to call THREE different people (multiple times) to get it fixed. And none of them are accountable or responsible for anything! And lets not get into the pharm industry's influence on my medical health. Treating a problem (i.e., selling drugs)? Heck yeah! Curing a problem (i.e., no more drugs)? Heck no! Government is innefficient and wasteful at times also, but the real killers are defense department contracts with civilian companies like Halliburton or Boeing. \r\n\r\nMeals on Wheels is a not-for-profit private organization with separate county-level organizations across the country. The source of funding in each county varies, but they will get local, state, and federal funding in each org. I'm sure it varies, and I don't have a source so it could be 1% total gov't funding or 100% gov't funding.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uopb","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808528,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"curzh","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_curdy","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28159-46c54648-0730-44da-bf1a-ddd9b31b536a-1566236768"}

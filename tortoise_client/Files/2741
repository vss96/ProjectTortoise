Most times, I find what I want in, like, 30 seconds.  It would be less than that if I had a faster Internet connection.  \r\n\r\nI know the words to use, and what not to use.  And I know when to use Wikipedia, or just go to a specific website (like for a company).\r\n\r\nMoreover, I know at least a little bit about just about all science and technology.  And I know where to start with art, business, religion, history, sports, etc.  So I carry around the top-level index in my head.\r\n.\r\nSo nature: intelligence and good memory.  Plus nurture: using the Internet since before it was called the Internet.  Knowing the tools.  Reading lots of stuff as a kid.","link_id":"t3_tlev","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807765,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ansible","edited":false,"id":"ctn66","parent_id":"t1_ctmpi","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8125-2407d39c-5145-4874-893a-e31ecbb744de-1566236760"}

{"body":"Yeah. Lisp is dynamically and strongly typed, b/c (car 3) will give an error. Strong/weak typing is about whether the type system can be circumvented, while static/dynamic typing is about whether the type checks are done at compile time or run time. (And then there's manifest/latent typing, which is about whether you declare types or let the system figure it out. That's also occasionally confused with strong/weak!)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tdba","subreddit":"programming","score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1165168146,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"BlakeStone","id":"ctgo4","parent_id":"t1_ctgc6","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807643,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5144-86b21e79-d686-4c7f-8b10-4cdfe546b0e7-1566236759"}

In fact, in some cases businesses were only notifying their California residents affected by a data theft until they were called out on it and then said, \"Oh, yeah - We'll notify the people in other states, too\"\r\nIANAL, etc.\r\n\r\nI think we need an ammendment that says individuals own (and have copyright rights to) their personal info, their DNA and their other physical and electromagnetic (brainwaves, EKGs, etc) properties.\r\n\r\nWhat if someone lost a disk with private information about a bunch of our corporate citizens? They'd be strung up immediately. These clowns (corps, not reddit) own and profit from owning our personal info.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166145694,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29445-7c4ca537-c117-4996-b7bb-76d52172d8ba-1566236769"}

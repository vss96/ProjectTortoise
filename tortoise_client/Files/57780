How dare they! Now our computers may be compromised!' or other such vitrol. However, the impact of the Sony/other company rootkits were minimal -- and still minimal to this date. There has been no widespread attacks (like Blaster or some of the more recent ones) documented either.\r\n\r\nTo borrow on Levitt's example from Freakonomics, the public is mainly outraged by the rootkit because it's an example of something that's beyond our sphere of control. But, no one -- especially the media -- has ever placed focus on the things that really matter, like safe browsing, proper use of a virus scanner or firewall, or even basic things such as \"DO NOT RUN THAT .EXE FILE\" in big bold letters.\r\n\r\nShould Sony be punished? Yes, but justly. Calling for a witch-hunt is not the proper way to handle things.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166592934,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40325-d719f62e-509d-442c-9e50-6880d86ffb90-1566236773"}

I see people get the shit kicked out of them, stabbed, shot at, and the like. I see people that have been hit by bricks, bottles, pipes, hammers, etc....it's never this one-one deal. Just like you said, there's always more street urchins to come out of the woodwork. Nothing gets the ghetto rats out of the gutters like a good fight. 1 person getting beat will turn into 12 people getting beat by 25 people, and from there is just grows. It's a mess and extremely dangerous.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809136,"gilded":0,"id":"cvnss","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvlho","author":"hopper","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43831-44a93f40-62bb-4a6e-a468-7070a6313385-1566236774"}

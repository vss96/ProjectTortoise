Learn to understand rethoric when you hear it. He's saying \"Germany never took them home, so how dare you justify Israel as being a) untouchable because of the atrocities comited to jews: Muslims never did that, and b) even entitled to the land on which they are\".\r\n \r\n Ultimately, Ahmadinejad is saying what half the world always says under their breath anyways, but don't have the balls to do so because of pervasive doublethink and propaganda: Israel has *no* right to subjugate the palestinians. Every possible effort should be made to create, establish and maintain a bi-state country. They aren't the invadees, they are the invaders... so can the \"oh god, they are anti-semitic zealots who want to destroy us\" polemics. Every single excursion Israel has ever made in the arab peninsula, including the 6 day war has always been greeted with tacit international acceptance at best, and always based on the century long guilt that they are genocide victims. Well, fuck, the arabs didn't commit that genocide.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809749,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cwjmo","id":"cwka7","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60482-1eab6e14-eb0d-47e7-85ae-cb9d9d166015-1566236780"}

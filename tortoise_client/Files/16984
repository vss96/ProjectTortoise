Problem is that to many  physicists don't seem to know this and still talk about this nonsensical Copenhagen interpretation of QM. \r\n\r\nBut its kind of understandable: QM works so good that its simply not important to thing about the philosophical implications so many physicist seem to abandoned it. Its like using a car: To drive it you don't have to know how the engine works, you only have to know how to turn it on.\r\n\r\nI for myself would even go a bit further and say that QM is in fact a deterministic theory, you only have to accept the reality of the underlying state and not the reality of the measured 'particles' (which simply don't exits but are nothing more than artifacts of the measuring process).\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vk0o","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166800772,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45433-91042660-aa92-4492-9549-7f378a3e6a33-1566236775"}

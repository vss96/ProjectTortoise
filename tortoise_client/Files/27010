He doesn't hate \"God\" either, since he doesn't exist, perhaps that's what you meant?\r\n\r\nDawkins is quite clear that what he opposes is the control over public matters that religion claims when that control is directly opposed to rational and scientific thought.  I've heard Dawkins is good friends with the minister of his local church, he doesn't \"hate\" anyone as far as I know, but he despises ignorance and superstition.  Perhaps most of all, when such ignorance begets more ignorance, such as the opposition of the teaching of Evolution in schools.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8sr","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57409-a801c7f8-28df-4df4-8156-352d612eff02-1566236779"}

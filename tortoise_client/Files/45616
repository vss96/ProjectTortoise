But if they insist on sticking to magic names, I guess that makes sense.\r\n\r\nStill, it reminds me of the dark ages of Visual Basic where some methods had special properties because of their name. For example, x_y would be an event handler if X happened to be a member variable and Y happened to be a event on that variable. \r\n\r\n&gt; Also with '-&gt;' it's easy to see what is happening without looking at the implementation of the class.\r\n\r\nBad idea. You shouldn't have to care if you are dealing with a property or a member variable, that is an implementation detail.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wcxk","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1167414237,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57068-e12f522b-5bcb-4138-924e-7a8c8cf72bdb-1566236779"}

{"body":"A lot of hospitals and physicians' practices are switching over to electronic rather than written patient files.  This makes it a lot easier to submit files for billing to insurance companies, Medicare, and Medicaid.  With this comes printed prescriptions that the physician signs after printing the prescription out.  This still doesn't stop people from not following the instructions on the side of the bottle or their physician's instructions.  Ask most people what kind of car they drive or what brand shoes they wear, and they can tell you in an instant.  Ask a lot of people what medications they are on and how many times a day they are supposed to take it, you get a lot of blank stares.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_td5k","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165118390,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"ansgenius","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctewz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctdlk","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807610,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4421-55cd194a-3167-444a-857e-652f37e3d455-1566236759"}

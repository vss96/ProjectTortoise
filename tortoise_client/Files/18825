There are only two compelling reasons I can see for picking something other than Ruby if given the choice (and many facotrs including target platform influence choice): speed and library availability. Both of these issues can be (and are being) addressed. From a language perspective I don't think you can beat it, but then again I'm a big fan of Smalltalk too.\r\n\r\nIt's not a good choice for GUI development on anything other than OS X.

Say what you will about Microsoft, the .NET Framework and Compact Framework are easy to use and cover a huge variety of platforms. The biggest caveat (for me) is that the language support for the full .NET Framework is much more extensive than for .NET CF (i.e. CF doesn't get F# or IronPython).","controversiality":1,"score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1167075181,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vzw8","id":"cvzya","author":"jsolson","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809367,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"49991-e9838493-9901-4a67-9694-8695efbd9d5e-1566236778"}

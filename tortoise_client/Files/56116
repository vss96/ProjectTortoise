Load time didn't exist in console games until CD-based media came along. The N64 used cartridges specifically because Nintendo didn't want load times.\"\r\n\r\nGamers wanted impressive visuals, and were willing to wait a little for them on Dreamcast and PSOne. When it comes to \"N64\" and \"visual\", the images that come to my mind is the ultra-choppy gameplay of goldeneye, or that \"Worst Game of All Time\" that is Superman 64.\r\n\r\n\"The Xbox 360 is selling abysmally in Japan, so the real question is whether they want a system with HDTV output. With the new Dragon Quest game coming to the DS, signs point to \"maybe.\"\"\r\n\r\nTrue. I did preface my statement with an IF. BTW, if you have a DS, I highly recommend Dragon Quest Heros: Rocketslime. Its a kid's game, through and through, but its also incredibly fun.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809503,"gilded":0,"id":"cw73e","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw3up","author":"redrobot5050","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"53904-7f7c29be-fbbd-458f-9d18-09c97efcf8ab-1566236779"}

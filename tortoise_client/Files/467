Basically, I said something along the lines of \"If you do X, Y might happen,\" and you said \"But I know of times where X was done and Y didn't happen.\"  So your argument really only does anything if it's in response to a claim like \"Whenever X happens, Y *always* happens.\"  So it's like me saying that throwing a cat off a roof is a bad idea and that the cat is likely to get hurt; then you say \"But my cousin did it and his cat was fine.\"  It's still a risky practice.\r\n\r\nAnd about it being a major contributing factor, I dunno.  I'm sure there are studies about this but I'm too lazy to look them up.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tl3j","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807801,"author":"mpecsek","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctot3","id":"ctp2u","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8939-9f167926-f237-465a-a767-4af4fb39d505-1566236760"}

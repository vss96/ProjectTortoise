Here's an excerpt: \r\n \r\n&gt;When they believe justice requires it, jurors can refuse to apply the law. Jurors have the power to consider whether the law itself is wrong (including whether it is \"unconstitutional\"), or is being applied for political reasons. Is the defendant being singled out as \"an example\" in order to demonstrate government muscle? Were the defendant's constitutional rights violated during the arrest? Much of today's \"crime wave\" consists of victimless crimes--crimes against the state, or \"political crimes\", so if you feel that a verdict of guilty would give the government too much power, or help keep a bad law alive, just remember that you can refuse to apply any law that violates your conscience.\r\n\r\nOh, thanks davepage.

Philosophy requires evidence to mount argument as well.\r\n\r\n&gt;You can speculate all you want that there is a physiological basis for consciousness...you have to provide some scrap of evidence.\r\n\r\nI'm observing consciousness in the presence of a living brain. Other people behave in a way that suggests consciousness, and they all have living brains, every one. I'm not aware of any account of behaviour that suggests consciousness in the absence of a living brain.\r\n\r\n&gt;Troglodytes like Pat Robertson and Richard Dawkins have turned the debate into venom spitting contest.\r\n\r\nIt's exactly this kind of equivalence that polarises the debate. I've heard far more 'venom' directed at Dawkins than I've ever heard or read him direct. He never gets worse than donnish and occasionally heavy-handed sarcasm.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166515303,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvamb","id":"cvbqd","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lessofthat","retrieved_on":1473808901,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37793-f1c8caef-9141-4329-bb55-d337b571c3d3-1566236772"}

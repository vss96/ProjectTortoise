I think that although there are good programmers who can write reasonably safe, readable c++, you can't count that those wrote the code you will be working on. Of course, there are people who will write ugly and buggy Java too, but the problem (as I see it) is that with c++, you can have pretty decent programmers and still get a mess. And when time comes to clean up after others, in Java at least you don't have to worry about memory corruption.\r\n\r\nMuch bad can be said about Java, but it hasn't got rusty nails sticking out at unexpected places to the same degree that c/c++ has.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_utqb","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166192373,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30417-1c7b48a7-96a8-4b45-a199-105e0225091b-1566236769"}

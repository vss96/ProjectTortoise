{"link_id":"t3_vcvm","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"The key phrase here is when Mankiw says that \"conservative\" is equivalent to \"classically liberal\". It is not. Case in point: the farm subsidies discussed in the Dave Barry article are roundly supported by those that identify themselves as conservative - after all, they benefit the republican base in the heart of the country, as well as large businesses.\r\n\r\nMankiw assumes that being pro-market is equivalent to being pro-business, which is simply wrong. As the example of farm subsidies demonstrates, legislation that explicitly helps business can be just as damaging as legislation that is designed to hinder business. Moreover, government intervention is often necessary to ensure that markets operate efficiently. Unless we break up monopolies and monopsonies and regulate businesses properly, markets will not produce the ideal results you learn about in freshman economics.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166565466,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vcvm","edited":false,"id":"cvf0q","author":"jkerwin","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808965,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39438-bd0844a7-ba19-4004-8249-0f374e041122-1566236773"}

The embryo requires a warm environment, specific hormones, ie., a willing mother-host. A sperm requires only one more thing: an egg. A sperm, in some cases, leads to a baby. An embryo, in some cases, leads to a baby. What's the difference?\r\n\r\nYou are right, the process doesn't matter. But a sperm is only composed of the DNA of its 'host', and the same goes for an egg. An embryo is something else, as it is composed of the DNA of both parents. It is entirely unique. It holds all of the material that makes it a human being, it just hasn't developed to a stage that it can breathe and walk and talk.\r\n\r\n&gt; The woman not having a choice justifies murder? I dunno about you, but I live in Canada where the death penalty is not legal. I do not think rape, especially in the case where the rapist is NOT the one being killed, should cause anyone to die. You believe that an embryo is a human being and you're saying an act it had absolutely nothing to do with justifies it being killed. I do not think innocent people should be killed because some guy raped some girl--no matter how much they depend on another human being.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying it justifies murder, I'm saying I don't know. The woman who has been raped may suffer serious psychological problems by carrying the child of her rapist. In that situation I simply don't know what is right or wrong. Again, it is completely different from being in the situation of having consensual sex, getting pregnant, and then more or less avoiding the consequences of that.\r\n\r\n&gt; But, then again, I'm not dead certain that an embryo is a human being and I'd much rather not make that decision until it affects me personally.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't certain that an embryo isn't a human being, then why take the chance at all of aborting it and possibly ending the life of a human being? Again, it contains every genetic property that makes it a unique human. At what point do you say 'this is human' or 'this isn't a human yet? Is it when it develops a heart, is it when it develops facial features? Is it when it can breathe on its own? Let's keep in mind that there are human beings alive today that can't claim all of those properties.\r\n\r\nI still think when you get down to it, eliminating a human embryo because you don't want the result of having sex is both irresponsible and wrong. Whether or not it is wrong for a woman that has been raped to have an abortion is besides me and besides the point, but I'd rather not make it illegal for her to get out of a situation she did not put herself in.\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165724556,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-6,"ups":-6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19627-0bd7b324-5a9c-4f27-91b3-d22d05843c87-1566236764"}

Which you can see at work when you compare their respective military doctrines.\r\n\r\nThe Americans are obsessed with jet fighters, submarines, aircraft carriers, tanks and other high $$$ systems. The Russians came up with the AK-47, the RPG (no American equivalent), anti-tank Kornets, anti-ship Sunburns, and even anti-aircraft carrier Yakhonts missiles.\r\n\r\nSo you know what?

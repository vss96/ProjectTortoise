There is a very real and strong reason to find your \"ultimate\" tool and that is that we, developers are human being and as such finite. It IS a problem and serious investment of time and effort to master some \"language\" with all its frameworks and idioms and stuff. I cannot, simply cannot, hold in my brain WinAPI, Borland VCL, UNIX reference, Python libraries, Ruby libraries, Java API, .NET API, Javascript/HTML/CSS/DOM etc etc. I want to have something left of me to have some semblance of a life, dammit!\r\n\r\nThat's first. Second - I'm so bloody tired to have to write the same old things again and again.

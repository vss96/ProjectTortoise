I don't think it's as simple as you're presenting it.  I suggested that you can feel however you want about a couple kissing, so long as you don't impose your feelings on them by mandating that they stop for the sake of your own comfort.  You apparently disagree.  So I ask you: why isn't it *your* responsibility to have the self-control not to try to regulate others' behavior just so you can feel more comfortable?\r\n\r\nI actually agree with you that couples publicly kissing, if done to excess, is obnoxious, whether they're gay or straight.  And, as I said, you and I have every right to tell them so if we're bothered by it.  But I simply don't think we have the right to enforce our standards of decency on others.  That shows a lack of self-control on our part.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t6wc","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1515-75e3235d-e2c2-4937-a2d2-71a75fdd71b3-1566236758"}

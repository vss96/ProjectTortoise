{"body":"Too bad they didn't have an extra dozen ropes for Bush and his cabinet.  They deserve to hang just as much as Saddam did.\r\n\r\nWhat I do not understand is the godalmighty rush to execute him, other then to do what this Administration is good at - covering up their crimes.\r\n\r\nI'd love to have finally learned (if that were ever even possible) about Rumsfeld's talk with Saddam and the Kuwait invasion.\r\n\r\nAnd I'd love to have finally learned (you know the rest) about Saddam's disarmament program before the second Gulf War and how he had tried to stave off the invasion.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, I'd have love to have learned of Saddam's \"involvement\" with Al-Queda and even the now-ancient allegations of his ties to 9/11 that are now vehemently denied (but we have the Internet, don't we?).\r\n\r\nSo a bad man is now gone, but that still leaves an awful lot of hanging that still needs to be done.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wf9e","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167452868,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":70,"ups":70,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lifeofliberty","id":"cwfhc","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wf9e","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809659,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58183-280d2dd6-9308-47c7-b30c-8305baf71c55-1566236780"}

A glance at the abstracts give you a good list of the most mature functional languages. The usual names are there: Ocaml, Haskell, Erlang, Scheme. Common Lisp is a notable omission, as it is also mature.\r\n\r\nWhen programming in functional languages you miss the wealth of libraries and available in more popular languages.  All these languages have good foreign function interfaces, so you end up reusing a lot of C libraries.\r\n\r\nUnder Windows, PLT Scheme can access any library published via a COM interface. Also under Windows, you can use Microsoft's flavor of Ocaml called F# and access all the libraries of the C# platform.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15992-1726c051-4c74-4598-990f-d95bdc6ea28d-1566236763"}

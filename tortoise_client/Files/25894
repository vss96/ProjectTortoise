Well, the professor in one of these that I had told me a funny story he read  that pertained to how he would *not* have his exams being deployed. The story goes like this...\r\n\r\nA student is cheating on an exam in one of these big classrooms. This student is caught by the professor, but the professor says nothing, thinking he'll punish the student when he arrives with the exam. The student seems to do this brash act yet again, and again, with careless regard of being caught! The professor grips his hand in anger and anticipation to vent on the student when he arrives. The student then \"finishes\" the exam and comes forward down the aisle past the other students left doing the exam in the huge auditorium. The professor then says, \"I caught you cheating on this exam. I can't take that and I'm going to need to have you visit the dean.\" The student says, \"This is the last exam of the semester, right?\" The professor says, \"Yes.\" The student continues, \"And this exam is worth 50% of my great, correct?\" The professor says, \"Yes, so?\" The student then asks, \"And you don't know my name or social security number, correct?\" The professor says, \"Well, no.\" The student said, \"Fantastic!\" and shoved his exam in the middle of the teacher's stack of collected exams, straightened the pile, and walked out.\r\n\r\nThe professor had no way of knowing which social security number or name was on the exam to know which student was cheating.\r\n","controversiality":1,"ups":-1,"score":-1,"created_utc":1166341062,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33534-a4e604de-b3d3-4b08-a75f-39e4d337b9de-1566236770"}

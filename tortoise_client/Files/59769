Any time someone is hanging around with a gun acting in a manner that makes people think he's a threat to himself and others, cops get nervous (or they get dead because they aren't being careful enough).\r\n\r\n&gt; I didn't say they would have to shoot his gun again. Next sniper shot can hit HIM if it's that dangerous.\r\n\r\nI didn't say they would have to shoot his gun again, either.  I also didn't say you said that.  It's just asinine to brush away all concerns about what happens if the sniper misses with a bland statement about the amount of ammunition the sniper is probably carrying.\r\n\r\nThe whole reason to have a sniper is so you *don't have to shoot more than once*, and *don't have to worry about the guy noticing someone's about to shoot at him* (or his gun).  If you have to shoot again, something has gone desperately wrong, and people may start dying.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uxr3","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808721,"author":"apotheon","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv26u","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv1yh","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32948-93fddd8e-7900-4c95-b172-751e6395c59f-1566236770"}

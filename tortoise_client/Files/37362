{"link_id":"t3_t6m2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"I've noticed as a young (26) married guy that the couple dynamic really makes things more difficult social-wise. Imagine you have the set of people you would be willing to hang out with, possibly quite large. Your wife also has a similar set. As a married couple for starters you're looking only at the intersection of those two sets that are in a relationship of some kind.\r\n\r\nBut that's not all; that just guarantees I like hanging out with the guy and she appreciates her company. We still do not know:\r\n1. The guy thinks I'm alright\r\n2. The girl thinks she's okay\r\n3. I think think the girl isn't annoying\r\n4. My wife doesn't mind the other guy\r\n5. She doesn't find me annoying\r\n6. He doesn't dislike my wife\r\n\r\nLest you think many of these segments are unimportant, we had some friends that doing stuff socially kinda fizzled because, well..., number 5. Otherwise, in the intersection with 1-&gt;4, 6 a go. \r\n\r\nWhile the article is more about singles and marrieds interacting, you have enough experience dealing with this Venn nightmare as a married couple perhaps you get a little gun-shy socially.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164992003,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ct8tp","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t6m2","author_flair_text":null,"author":"danteembermage","retrieved_on":1473807494,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1455-1a9d54c6-c2fd-45ff-9a64-e605f09141db-1566236758"}

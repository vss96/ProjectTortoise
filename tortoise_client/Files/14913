All too predictable, but interesting.\r\n\r\nIt is as difficult to properly deregulate an industry or market as it is to regulate it.  Unfortunately, the overly simplistic presumption, favored by many soi disant conservatives (anyone can for any reason so describe themselves  -- there's no credentials checking), is that simple wholesale deregulation magically allows omniscient, and thus equitable, market forces to operate.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will, after a time, although that's not guaranteed.  What does too often happen is that predatory collections of private wealth (a.k.a. one or more big corporations acting in concert) overtly or covertly distort the market for their ends.\r\n\r\nObserve that when regulation interferes with predatory behaviors, regulation is decried by the predatory industry as interference; when regulation protects existing market position or limits consumer choice, the industry is quick to lobby for protective regulation.\r\n\r\nHealth care is seldom a discretionary purchase: Few people indulge in recreational medical procedures.  As such, the delivery of health care cannot be designed as if it's governed by an Economics 1A  notion of \"deregulated\" supply and demand.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t92a","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1676-bd4707cb-a4a1-43cb-b6de-522e25690aab-1566236758"}

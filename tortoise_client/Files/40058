The less visual detail there is in the character the more people will identify with the situations they are placed in and empathize more with their responses.\r\n\r\nMore realistically drawn comics attempt to draw the viewer into a fantasy world, ie the less detail the more concrete or recognizable a character's situation will be, whereas the more detail the less meaning the created world will have in relation to the reader's reality.\r\n\r\nArchie depicts life in the 1950's. Sure most of the situations are similar, but there is something off. Archie is an industrial age morality attempting to project itself onto an information age morality while retaining its older nostalgic readers. But as Archie's world diminishes in meaning from our own, the more detail the author's must place in the fantasy world in an attempt to make it more real.\r\n\r\nBut by doing so the reader cannot identify with the character. Does the reader have the same facial features? Or is it the sanitized adventures of Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan? In either case Archie would never go out painting signs to earn extra date money today. He would be making a blog. As far as romantic antics are concerned, that just invites a zero tolerance punishment.\r\n\r\nRiverdale no longer exists. And as such the fairy tale needs realism to force it to be real.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808977,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvfp3","parent_id":"t3_vfe7","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39841-4c1ca051-110a-460c-9a5d-5c6da6dc8b3a-1566236773"}

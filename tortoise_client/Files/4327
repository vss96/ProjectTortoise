First the fact about clock skew:\r\n\r\nYou can identify a computer by its clock skew.\r\n\r\nBut this is useless with Tor.  A little about Tor:\r\n\r\n1.  Tor clients only talk to trusted Tor servers.\r\n2.  Tor clients will not respond to anything from unknown external entities.\r\n3.  Tor servers hop client requests/responses across multiple Tor servers.\r\n\r\nSo the client never, ever, ever is known by its target.  Tor servers never, ever know who the originator of a request is.  A Tor server COULD use clock skew to an originator of a request or response, but it will never, ever know if that computer is the originating Tor client or just another Tor server hopping the request.\r\n\r\nClock skew, in the end, is useless with Tor.  It would work great with something like Bittorrent though.\r\n\r\nOh well, its been a long time and as of yet not a single example showing this working has popped up.  Its one thing to say its possible, its another to actually prove it (no, a paper is not proof).","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809584,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cwbem","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_waq3","author":"sbrown123","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56081-39bc39db-df55-4b57-b6c5-87f5f6b84d37-1566236779"}

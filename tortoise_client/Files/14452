Tweek was winning because he used political power instead of competing fairly.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it's almost always the large corporation that has the money to buy political power.  The situation was sort of turned on its head to surprise people into thinking, but the point is that corporations can \"railroad into town\" because they get lots of protection and favors from the government.  Without the power to turn money into protective laws, there would much less advantage in being *big* as opposed to *selling a good product*.\r\n\r\nDon't confuse what you want the government to do with what it actually does.  I know you view the government as protecting the little guy, but why should they?  Lawmakers sell power to the highest bidder, and they will to continue to do so as long as they have power.  It's human nature.  The standard scam is to support laws that *seem* to protect the public from large businesses, but actually protect large businesses from competition -- like labor laws, taxes, and overbearing regulation.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tib7","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807758,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"asokoloski","id":"ctmsk","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctk09","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7945-d05b6245-8912-4013-9c84-d5e2339098c3-1566236760"}

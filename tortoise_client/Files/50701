{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ure4","body":"The biblical God cared about a fancy box (the Ark of the Covenant).  He cared about a fancy tent (the Tabernacle). He cared about a fancy building (Solomon's Temple).  He cared about fancy gifts like gold, myrrh, and frankicense enough to send Magi to give them to His Son soon after his birth.\r\n\r\nAnd Jesus cared enough about fancy perfume to allow a woman to put some that would cost a year's wages on his *feet*.  I think it's safe to say that the biblical God certainly cares about the fancy things that people do for His sake.","controversiality":0,"score":12,"ups":12,"created_utc":1166126011,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cusw4","id":"cusz7","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808547,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28686-e5dc2590-b2cd-457b-a06f-f411f2202592-1566236768"}

If you look at the article, it gives links like \"download 24 TV episodes\" and other links in a similar vein.\r\n\r\nActually, providing access to **infringing** content is illegal. Linking to non-infringing content is fine.\r\n\r\nGiven the reddit title and the outrage of the article, i was assuming that the author had been linking directly to Fox-hosted stuff. That would be non-infringing content, and would be fine under the DMCA.\r\n\r\nHowever, a [closer examination](http://quicksilverscreen.com/watch-24-episodes-online-free/) suggests he was linking to an infringing site. As such, Fox seems to be within its legal rights.\r\n\r\nThe usual disclaimers apply: IANAL, YMMV, TNSTAAFL, etc.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t672","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807513,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jmelesky","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct7hc","id":"ct9sk","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1976-73a3b651-2965-4d79-adb0-d9f4e90fac95-1566236758"}

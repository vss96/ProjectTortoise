Even the foundations of QM rely on this and require that certain operators are hermitian because otherwise you would get measured data with complex value (which can't happen in reality). So every use of mathematics has to aligned to reality or you will get invalid results - even if they are totally valid from a pure mathematical point of view.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, using a 'implausible result' can lead to big discoveries like the negative solutions of the Dirac equation. If Dirac had simply abandoned them, he had missed his biggest discovery.\r\n\r\nWith strings there is the additional problem that most things are nearly impossible to test because of the high required energies.\r\n\r\nSo in physics its always necessary to look beyond pure mathematics and consider the physical implications of a certain result. Good theoretical physicists do this of course, but there are other which draw conclusions which are simply to far fetched. In QM I know about many researchers who simply deny to think about the 'reality of the quantum world' and simply apply mathematical formalisms to get results. And in QM this works really well - until you enter uncharted terrain.\r\n\r\nIn physics mathematics is still only a tool. You can work out lots of things by simple working on a pure mathematical level, by simply using theorems without thinking about the concrete meaning, but while in mathematics this a a totally valid method of work, in physics it can lead you astray easily. \r\n\r\nI think thats the big difference between a good physicist and a good mathematician: While the mathematician has to learn to abandon the concept of always grasping what a certain mathematical construct means (or it will hinder him in making progress), the physician can't afford this, because in the end he always has to get back to reality (but this will probably also makes him a less good mathematician).\r\n\r\n","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166890129,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47359-a4f994cf-d9db-4879-ab94-b69e37b82c91-1566236775"}

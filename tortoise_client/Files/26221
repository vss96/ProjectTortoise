Consider what it was designed to do, and then look at it on a feature-by-feature basis.  Most features in C have a very high power-to-weight ratio: they solve significant pain points of assembly and yet don't add a lot of conceptual baggage.  They're also quite composable.\r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that it was pressed into service in domains outside its intended use.  For system's programming, I can't really imagine wanting anything changes to the languages.  Well, maybe cleaned up syntax, a structural macro system, and a way to reset the stack to an arbitrary block of memory (so you can implement continuations &amp; lightweight threads).","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vzw8","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52857-d704d99f-3ed6-4bcd-b810-a0f6644ba61d-1566236778"}

Obviously, in order for something to be \"really funny\" it might have to be approaching 1, with five or six 9s.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, there are naive processes in the mind that *do* believe the world to be rational, or at least *rationalizable*. Where that rationability fails, we don't expect; most things we learn about the world *seem* fairly obvious. Physics, for example, is the codified study of the obvious--we already \"know\" that things that go up come down, we just have to answer why. Humans, on the other hand, are inherently absurd entities in relation to this seemingly logical world they inhabit (I know it's only logical because we proceed from a great corpus of experience, but that's assumed for any syllogism, no?). We do many un-rational things, or, at least, things that the primitive parts of our minds tell us to remain unexpectant of. That is the \"human condition\" variable in my formula--the more a given situational irony has to do with humanity in general, the more we are enticed by it, and the less we expect it. Love would be the obvious example of this--a complete mystery to most people, simply because they choose not to analyze it. Comedy itself, the human ability to find things amusing, is another.\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard the phrase \"kids say the darndest things?\" Simply put, it means that kids say things that are funny because they, not having our built-in corpus of expectations--our \"common sense\", can say things that defy our rationalizations of the world around us, and cause us to rethink those rationalizations. For example, we rationalize dreaming to be an obvious thing for humanity to do. However, when we try to analyze it in terms of its component parts--something no one with \"common sense\" would do--we end up with a coma, amnesia, and hallucinations, all symptoms of drug or disease, and things one would go to the hospital for (not that I'm deriding neurologists, psychologists, or anyone like that here--they study the brain and mind and end up with dreams by emergence, instead of starting with dreams and trying to find cause). The comic points out that we only make a special case for this one instance of symptomatic behaviour because it is ingrained in our cultural psyche to do so, and not doing so would be impractical. Jokes about common sense itself, I'd say, would score as close on the \"human condition\" variable to 1 as possible.","link_id":"t3_wbt3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59252-5c2fcdbd-e9ea-43bf-b179-cb69f8ed0e37-1566236780"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"\"Do you think that in over 100 years of progressive social discourse, that no states have ever even once experimented in this way?\"\r\n\r\nYes, and natural selection weeded out the wimpy states so now the whole US is \"tough on crime\". \r\n\r\nWait a minute. Is that a realistic description of what happened? No. Very few \"restorative punishment\" efforts have been made, and they have succumbed to unpopularity, not inefficiency. Whether you consider yourself liberal or conservative, you should understand that policies in a democracy (or any state, really) are kept or rejected based on their popularity, not their effectiveness. And whether crime pays or not, to be seen as being \"tough on crime\" certainly pays if you're a politician in the US, where it's bad PR to show weakness, compassion and other womanly traits.\r\n\r\nThe state I live in (which is not a US state) gets by with some 1/10 the incarceration times of the US, and yet crime is lower. But that's all explained by ethnic homogeniety, so you don't have to think too much about it. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;","link_id":"t3_trhc","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165414810,"score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"vintermann","parent_id":"t1_cts7w","id":"ctu2p","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807894,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11417-fab29a2d-d2a4-41e8-b0b1-9a3c09b517d1-1566236761"}

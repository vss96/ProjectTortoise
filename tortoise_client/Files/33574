{"body":"It seems like we have missed an important part of the life cycle in this discussion.  If a large proportion of fertilized eggs never implants or survives long, there is certainly potential for significant selection.  I don't think modern medicine would ameliorate this effect since many of these events are probably not noticed or only attended to after the event.  Traits that might confer a survival advantage during early development are probably not the ones most people are interested in. However, do the gene variations that provide these advantages also have other effects that are significant (even deleterious) later in life?","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vqk3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166885042,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"orco2006","edited":false,"id":"cvuh3","parent_id":"t3_vqk3","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809262,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47268-75d81c97-c061-47c4-a73e-31ae9bab51cd-1566236775"}

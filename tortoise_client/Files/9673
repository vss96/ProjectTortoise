GHC's run-time system can be made to segfault in certain situations.  There isn't a *guarantee*. GHC does, however, do a pretty good job at avoiding these.\r\n\r\nWhile Haskell has automatic garbage collection, it does suffer from potential space leaks. These leaks are a potential side-effect of lazy evaluation.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_vgr0","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809022,"author":"glguy","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvhy9","parent_id":"t3_vgr0","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40936-a8c6d55d-e201-4e9b-8ece-6853fd37b729-1566236773"}

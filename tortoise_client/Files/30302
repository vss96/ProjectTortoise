As a Web startup, your number one priority is getting people to try out your thing. If you support OpenID (and/or Yahoo!'s BBAuth), the barrier to trying something out is severely reduced. Sure, there aren't that many OpenIDs out there yet (aside from the 10s of millions of LiveJournal accounts) but the people who do have them are far more likely to be early adopters, exactly the people you want trying out your app.\r\n\r\nRight now I would argue that having OpenID support is especially valuable for a startup, as it gives you free exposure. There's a very strong chance that OpenID is going to take off in a much bigger way over the next 12 months - being there right at the start will give your startup a much needed boost in publicity for a relatively small investment of time.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809470,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cw4gh","edited":false,"id":"cw5ga","author":"simonw","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52963-8ed6ae5e-34bb-4458-ba04-5fbe02f02f28-1566236778"}

For them, the work is a lot like collecting tokens in a video game.  \r\n\r\nWhat we really need are long-term \"Hedonism Towns\" not like Vegas, but campuses where young people go to live together where they can party and have none of the bothersome \"classes\" or \"majors\" to deal with.  Better for all, really.  Just have campuses like we do now, except no mandatory classes and no professors, just lots of activities like sporting events to attend, games, volleyball, SCUBA lessons, weight rooms, and lots of sex, booze, and drugs.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, universities are not a good place for truly intellectual people because all they are is a curiousity amongst the giant noise of young people getting their freak on.  \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28162-7ce85115-aa22-4264-856f-87cba8c8358a-1566236768"}

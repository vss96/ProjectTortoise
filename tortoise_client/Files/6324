{"body":"Great story. I hike and hunt frequently in very remote rugged terrain (no cell service or homes for miles). I do not use electronic GPS gadgets for navigation!!! I dropped one once and it broke while I was out hiking. I was relying on this damn thing to get me back to my truck, but now its screen was shattered (I made it out with a bit of luck). Since that time, I've relied on my old-fashioned, trusted Silva compass. Learn how to read a map and a compass and you'll be fine. Trash the e-gadgets NOW and do not trust your life or the lives of others with them :)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u3q9","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":10,"score":10,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165590909,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t3_u3q9","edited":false,"id":"cu4c5","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808084,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16062-df4de43b-e91b-4f42-8ef2-df1450ea5e9a-1566236763"}

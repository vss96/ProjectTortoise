Any society that can't spare a gallon of water here and there to make hydrogen won't even have flush toilets, much less be in the business of making hydrogen.\r\n\r\n&gt; “Ultimately, hydrogen has to be made from renewable electricity by electrolysis of water in the beginning,” Bossel explains\r\n\r\nNo. Hydrogen can be made very efficiently with nuclear plants, using (for example) thermally assisted electrolysis. Why *assume* renewables, rather than assuming all greenhouse-free sustainable power sources?\r\n\r\nHydrogen does have some big problems - the lossy nature of the electrolysis/fuel-cell cycle is a big one - but some of this guy's reasons are simply faulty.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808362,"gilded":0,"id":"cuj0l","parent_id":"t3_uhwu","edited":false,"author":"anonymous-coward","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24085-0246c5ff-bea8-499c-8b9d-b753971e33d7-1566236767"}

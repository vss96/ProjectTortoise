Right now electric cars are not really a viable alternative.  If laws are passed requiring Zero emmisions vehicles then I'm sure the price on them will come down as they are mass produced, as well as the additional stations built to deal with the fact that electric cars have a much shorter driving range.\r\n\r\nI do currently drive an ordinary vehicle, but that's because I can afford neither to live without a vehicle nor an electric vehicle.  I'm sure many people are in the same boat.  A change in the laws would force a change in the situation.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ubmh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165890923,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23879-0d9ecbd5-bbc6-4d72-a940-f0540961afa0-1566236767"}

{"body":"For you the only people who can have expertise on the fraudulent nature of Mormonism would be devout Mormons and devout Mormons, especially those employed by Mormon interests, are not going to declare their religion a colossal fraud.  If a scholar comes to the conlusion their faith is founded on the lies of a 19th century American opportunist then he loses his faith, but those still in the faith dismiss his scholarship.  I can appreciate the circular trap you're in but we are not in it and when you ask us to be academic and objective but cite Brigham Young University... well you're lucky if we don't laugh about Bring 'em Young and keep em coming.  Mormons were fine with polygammy until it meant Utah couldn't be a state.  Then the theology changed. \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vnhg","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166810437,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"degustibus","id":"cvrm4","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvrbn","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809209,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45802-c12f7f41-3627-4a01-8d64-fa9281254536-1566236775"}

{"body":"&gt;You're trying to slice it as thin as possible.\r\n\r\nAs I say elsewhere, you can make the case that 'threatening violence' counts as terrorism. I don't think that case is insane, though I don't terribly agree.. My contention is only that most Christians don't threaten violence.\r\n\r\n&gt;How about they change it now to reflect womens rights.\r\n\r\nThere's a civil war going on inside several denominations over exactly that. Not all Christians are of one mind on it.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v6h2","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166459636,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lessofthat","id":"cv8bn","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv84x","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808836,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36068-f430b27e-d9e9-4c9a-ba46-4a617213d195-1566236772"}

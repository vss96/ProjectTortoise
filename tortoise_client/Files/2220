In practice, I just spent over a week trying to get an app working with Tomcat 6 and JSF 1.2.  Supposedly APIs are supposed to be stable &amp; supported as long as you stick to the documentation, but the documentation never explains every little nook &amp; cranny, and so a change that the developer *thinks* won't impact anyone ends up breaking everything.\r\n\r\nOf course, Tomcat 5.5 [won't even run under JDK 1.6](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6434149), so it's not like we can stay put either.  Technically, that bug isn't actually a bug (ClassLoader works according to spec), but so many third-party programs (including Tomcat) assumed that loadClass() works with array types that most everything is broken.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w9xd","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809588,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nostrademons","id":"cwbmp","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwblt","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56185-c095b8a3-1df7-4e53-8abd-8e8d6cd87f3e-1566236779"}

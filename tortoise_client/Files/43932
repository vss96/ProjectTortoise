{"controversiality":0,"body":"I agree with you about the way in which Motherwit has been lost in our increasingly ready-made, disposable society.  There are so many issues connected to this one idea of eating for $1.00 a day.  \r\n\r\nThe class issue is a huge one.  I had a friend who grew up really, really poor.  She got a good education and got out of the poverty cycle.  However, she absolutely refused to eat beans and rice.  She saw it as \"poverty food.\"  And that was connected to an abusive family background.  Eating less diverse foods, healthier foods were psycologically linked to abuse and deprivation.  On the flip side, my parents grew up in an inter-connected community filled with suportive loving relatives.  They associate this \"poverty food\" with culture, history and strong families.\r\n\r\nYou are also correct about the issue of coporate chains and supermarkets purposefully depriving depressed communities of outlets to purchase healthier, inexpensive food.  Especially when they can open a smaller convienance version...such as BP's mini-mart or Giant Eagle's GetgO.  Recently, Pittsburgh, Pensylvania was cracking down on jitney drivers.  The African-American community denounced this and kicked up a fuss.  For some families using a $6.00 jitney was the only way to could bring home those healthier, bulk items.  And the Yellow Cab Company was not only more expensive, but, would often refuse to take them to their homes.  \r\n\r\nWhat I find truly interesting is the growing numbers of middle class and upper class, educated, professional families - like ours - who are choosing and practicing \"voluntary simplicity.\" Whereas people who have recently broken the poverty cycle are aiming for as much bling and excess as they possibly can.  We found this issue affects many critical decisions.  I was consulting for a Midwife Center which was providing free well woman care to local minority women.    It was hard to attract women of colour to the center.  They all wanted a hospital birth with all the \"trimmings.\"  Of course, in many of their communities - having a baby in a hospital is a relatively new \"luxury.\"  All of the middle and upper class women suddenly want midwives and birth centers. Advertising the jacuzzi's in the birthing rooms helped...as did a few celebrity's using midwives and doulas.  \r\n\r\nThe fact remains...the under class is always 20 to 30 years behind the trend.  What ceases to be luxury to some becomes a luxury for another.  And food is a tremendously symbolic thing.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t9us","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165097318,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":5,"score":5,"author":"svaha","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctdpf","parent_id":"t1_ctd8u","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807586,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3900-cdfe458f-4986-41bb-9ab1-c9b8ebc415aa-1566236759"}

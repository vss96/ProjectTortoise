Is he saying French sauces are the best and Americans can't comment on them? Or is it that American sauces are the best and telling the French is a waste of time? It's confusing because American hot sauces are fucking amazing. The French have nothing on them. However, French cooking is often stereotyped as the best.\r\n\r\nI guess he missed the part of the book where you shouldn't be too inventive with your analogies. That goes for metaphors too:\r\n\r\n&gt;Truss is their Jeremiah.","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6439-16dce79c-8431-442e-929e-1ba29a9fbb6f-1566236760"}

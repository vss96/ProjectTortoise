{"controversiality":0,"body":"I know you hold dear christian beliefs and teachings. Bear in mind that when you rant about \"vile curses\" you may lose some credibility. I am an agnostic -- that has NOTHING to do with my politics, although as I become older, my politics and religious beliefs are meshing more and more.\r\n\r\nI was raised by a devoutly christian mother, and for years tried to make sense of a life based on the principles laid out in the bible.\r\n\r\nSlowly I moved from rationalizing the bible's teachings to thinking some parts must have been misinterpreted to questioning the existence of god. Now, I seriously doubt there is any divine entity, but am open to anyone who has proof one way or the other.\r\n\r\nThe little girl in the film does not appear oppressed, coerced, or treated badly. She seem comfortable with the mild cursing and the whole episode seems enjoyable to her and most people watching the film.\r\n\r\nI would truly like to hear the little girl's own words regarding the film.\r\n\r\nYou, OTOH, appear a bit harsh. Before you tell a child he could well burn for all eternity, think -- what actual evidence do you have for that belief? Some book that any student of theology knows has been cobbled together and changed numerous times to suit whoever was in power at the time? \r\n\r\nYou know, religious beliefs are nice and comfortable, but they are only Santa-Claus, Pie-in-the-sky superstitions. We are here for a very short time. Then we are gone, forever. Live your life free from some restrictive mumbo-jumbo and try to be as happy as you are able.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u9s2","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165786357,"author":"DA5lD","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cucxu","parent_id":"t1_cucuy","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808247,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20800-ba2dc69b-ee64-4cab-9578-837d7248affc-1566236765"}

Just because we've had a run of a few hundred years (the blink of an eye in evolutionary time) where productivity has grown and birth rates have fallen, does not mean that it will continue forever.\r\n\r\nYou can't expect agricultural technology to yield exponential growth rates forever, because there are limits imposed by the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface.  I don't know when we'll have problems with diminishing returns on investment on agricultural research, but it's bound to happen sometime.\r\n\r\nAlso, not everybody is having 0, 1, or 2 kids.  There are still people who have big families, and those are the ones who are going to be left after a few generations.  If there are any genes that lead to having large families, they're being selected.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make an argument that Malthus was wrong in any fundamental sense, you have to either explain how we can break the laws of thermodynamics, or why evolution has stopped working on humans.\r\n\r\nNone of this is to say that we're teetering at the Malthusian edge, or that we will be in the near future.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uboe","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20189-9e40ea3c-9a1f-4926-9da3-e9f91f598cec-1566236765"}

Not everyone agrees on what human rights are.  Some people think there is an inherent right to economic equality, I do not.  Everyone is justified in his own mind, even you and me.\r\n\r\nFor instance even if the people in question are stupid or \"mentally disadvantaged,\" if the bank says very clearly:\r\n\r\n&gt;We will change your loan so that you can\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;1. Have $20,000 now, but\r\n&gt;2. Have to pay us $40,000 more in the long run.\r\n\r\nI do not think there is anything wrong with that, no matter how you slice it.  The only way I would oppose such a thing is if all the negotiators for the home-owner's side were legally retarded.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with me, then we have no problem.  If you disagree, well, that's fine, but you've also shot holes through this crazy idea that\r\n\r\n&gt;No one has, or needs, a definition of a pile of evil, which is exactly what you were demanding.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t66j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807496,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ct8vh","parent_id":"t1_ct7gg","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1467-0e5e4d43-cc77-4a58-a443-54ba7a90b27e-1566236758"}

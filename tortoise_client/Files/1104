The questions are very vague and broad; in many cases they might as well be asking \"do you think you are more *thinking* or *feeling*\", over and over again.\r\n\r\n2. I like to plan carefully for big important things (like going on a long holiday, or having a job), but I'm spontaneous about little things.  And I like to think that I am rational and logical in my approach to real life (I am an atheist and a sceptic), but that does not mean that I don't enjoy fantasy and speculation (I'm a science fiction fan).  Because the test questions are so broad and general, they don't seem to take into account the fact that people are not unilaterally aligned to these axes all the time.\r\n\r\nSo, like all other personality tests online, I'm taking it with a grain of salt.  I definitely agree that I'm introverted, at least, and the other results are what I would *like* them to be.","score":22,"ups":22,"created_utc":1165832105,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuezf","parent_id":"t3_ue7v","edited":false,"author":"confluence","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808285,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21962-86d241bc-4593-41b2-bb2d-b8ddadc631c3-1566236766"}

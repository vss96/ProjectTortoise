Let's compare:\r\n\r\nFamily Guy - Clever song lampooning censorship of dirty language and obscenity, basically tells them they suck.\r\n\r\nSNL - Exposes actual incidents of censorship of information done by media companies thanks to influence by their parent companies.\r\n\r\nNot even a fair comparison. Hell they aren't even covering the same subject matter. Downvoted simply because of the misrepresentative title.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w9x2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809565,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cwafr","parent_id":"t3_w9x2","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55547-a0982def-0661-4355-ace8-deedb3ac7cca-1566236779"}

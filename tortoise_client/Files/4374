Reddit is strictly anti Israel. This story proves it. You took a report of a violent crime and you're treating it as a story on Israel, or Jews, rather than a story about a violent criminals who happen to be Israeli Jews.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, if you'd take a story of a crime by Mexicans or Amish or French and assume all Mexicans/Amish/French are inherenntly violent criminals, you'd be correctly called a bigot and a fool. Yet you do the same thing here with a story of Israelis and you're upmodded.

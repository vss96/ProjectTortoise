However, It's not that I don't want to perform.\r\n\r\nHere's the problem: If I'm productive, I work 9-5 every weekday, and get paid. If I'm moderately productive, or even slightly less so, I work 9-5 every weekday and get paid. \r\n\r\nWhy would I bust my balls for hours and hours, day after day, for no added benefit? I'm not a masochist.\r\n\r\nIf my boss wanted me to get more done, he'd only have to undo one simple thing: the company mandate that I stay until 5, or work every weekday.\r\n\r\nIf I was assigned more work than I get done in a typical day at my present level of output every morning, but told that I could go home when it's done, I'd be more than happy to do that additional work quickly and efficiently, and leave when I'm done.\r\n\r\nIf it's slow (and my job gets VERY slow at the end of summer, for example) don't force me to come in every day and waste my time when it's beautiful out and I don't have enough vacation days to take the time off. Just let it slide, and trust me to do my job in the time I allot to it.\r\n\r\nI don't mind selling my productivity. I just don't appreciate being forced to obey draconian hourly requirements whether I have things to do or not. Give me a little slack on hours, and I wouldn't feel the need to waste the time at work.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807838,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctr20","parent_id":"t1_ctql8","edited":false,"author":"The_Mudslinger","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9957-1c2616a3-27c1-4f5a-b4a1-99068762e1a2-1566236761"}

{"controversiality":1,"body":"&gt;How does any judge justify ruining the life of someone who clearly does not deserve it, technicality or no?\r\n\r\nI felt sympathetic until I got to the part where his friends gang-raped a severely intoxicated 17-year-old girl.\r\n\r\n&gt;On New Yearâ€™s Eve in 2003, Mr. Wilson and several friends rented a hotel room for a party at which they planned to have plenty of alcohol, marijuana and sex. One friend, goofing around with a video camera, captured much of the action on videotape. A 17-year-old girl reported after leaving the party that she had been gang raped. The tape showed that she was severely intoxicated.\r\n\r\n&gt;A second girl, a 15-year-old, also attended the party, but did not drink or smoke. She had what she later said was consensual oral sex with Mr. Wilson. But according to the law, a 15-year-old is below the age of consent. Mr. Wilson went to trial on charges of rape and aggravated child molesting.\r\n\r\nIf he was not present when that part happened, then I feel sympathetic.  But if he hung around while his buddies sexually assaulted a drunk teenager, then fuck him and his friends.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vd0x","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166548663,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"adrian","parent_id":"t1_cvdhz","edited":false,"id":"cvdl3","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808937,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38663-669a252b-da21-4b87-bdc0-a32bdd29e731-1566236773"}

The names in Haskell are objectively bad, (IMO). Show doesn't show anything, it returns a string representation. That a _ at the end means \"and drop the result\" isn't obvious at all.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean I don't like Haskell, because despite myself I do. I do realize it has the same cavalier attitude to naming as other functional languages, though (with Lisp being the biggest sinner).\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_twtt","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16029-3389aa3f-e441-4dd5-9b46-c49b1b35f4c4-1566236763"}

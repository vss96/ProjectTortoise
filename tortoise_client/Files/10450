I've known about the 'Oxford Comma' debate (\"this, that, and the other\" vs. \"this, that and the other\") for a long time, but I've never heard of the comma before a trailing 'too' being left out, since it basically amounts to being a parenthetical.  With the 'actually' example, though, I can say I've seen things like \"Actually it is...\" or \"It is actually...\" without the comma, so maybe it's just a part of the slowly creeping death of the comma.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vqj5","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45851-6602add7-749a-45d6-ae48-5071f14d7fc5-1566236775"}

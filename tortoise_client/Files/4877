Theres nothing stopping me from claiming I am a muslim, if I knew enough about their scripture and all that. Its a very strange world. If it helps any, I was equally shocked that you would be jailed for chewing gum in singapore when I learned that many years ago. \r\n\r\nI find it quite amusing that I am \"an apologist of religion\", when I was just completely wrong in interpreting the signs. Quite a leap there mister.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28175-03941742-f36b-4f21-ad1d-9666b7fbea4e-1566236768"}

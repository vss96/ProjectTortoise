Moreover, you have to do it anyways or your app will crash the first time Mr. O'Donald signs in.\r\n\r\nIt isn't hard, but you need to do it each and every time, and people miss it sometimes. A lot of fields are supposed to accept strings that never normally contain a quote, it's not just the user name. Many people quote strings with \" and Mr. O'Donald wouldn't cause them any problems. \r\n\r\nWhat are you trying to prove? SQL injection attacks do happen, and if everyone used parametric statements, they would never work.\r\n\r\n&gt; When you use a parametrized statement it essentially does the same thing, it escapes the quotes.\r\n\r\nNo, decent databases send the parameters separately and in their native format (e.g. not converting numbers to strings). How do you expect the query plan cache to work if the driver embedded the values in the string?","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166698307,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42947-a1b67ff2-728e-4417-8d80-26b1266388a9-1566236774"}

But there is no way that each superposition 'knows' to which world they belongs, so with each interaction we should see interactions with things in other worlds. This don't seem to be the case or we should see it quite often in experiments.\r\n\r\nMany world requires the /additional/ hypothesis that there is a mechanism which prevents this interaction, separating the 'worlds' forever. Without ever being able to measure those states in a different world. This is magical mumbo-jumbo without any experimental evidence.

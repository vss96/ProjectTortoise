In fact, it's not very far from \"soy couldn't do anything - it's perfect food that angels fart onto our plates!\" which you *claim* to not have implied, when in fact you did.\r\n\r\nFinally, the political risks of phytoestrogens are far greater than xenoestrogens. Xenoestrogens will be dealt with at least in Europe by [REACH](http://www.chemicalspolicy.org/reach.shtml). Within a few decades, they will surely have disappeared. Phytoestrogens will still be with us, and so will an agricultural industry intent on force-feeding them to us.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ul4x","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25490-e4a87a3b-4af0-443e-8b55-d70eaa65b4aa-1566236767"}

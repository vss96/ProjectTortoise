Any bugs that occur *after* the deadline lead to instant disqualification. There's not much time to write unit tests so you'll be at a big advantage if your language rules out more bugs before you submit, so your code doesn't fail after the deadline, when you've no chance to fix things.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13038-31117201-22b0-4690-b5b7-c6c532509845-1566236762"}

It's what I was brought up as, and out of all the mainstream Christian factions I see it as the one that causes the least problems. My local priest was pro-choice, because his way of interpreting the bible wasn't literal and one pasage in the bible states that god has planned every part of our life, so he will have planned for someone to have an abortion if they think they've chosen to have one.\r\n\r\nI also think a lot more non-religious believe in god and not the church, that's how I felt when I left the church. How can anyone trust their soul to an organisation that protects child abusers, caused wars killing millions, repressed women and enslaved blacks, oh and stole peoples money by making them think they could buy their way into heaven... that's why I dispise the catholic church.\r\n\r\nWhenever I'm pushed to question what a god would be, I always end up thinking of the Anglican one (no hell btw). So I believe this is what some people who still say they're Christian are doing, others will be ones who follow the christian ideals and the rest will likely still be putting Anglican on their census forms etc because they're British.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vtxd","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809288,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","parent_id":"t1_cvupz","edited":false,"id":"cvvth","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"47946-55761241-0e93-4792-8163-cde36435a55d-1566236777"}

That is, in a do-block, you're allowed to run IO computations, and get their pure results. These results can be passed on to pure functions which give parts of the output of the program, or information necessary for deciding what future IO computation to do.\r\n\r\nYou only need to implement the \"candy-coating\" of your program in IO -- the part which determines *where* to get inputs, and *which* outputs to display and real-world actions to take. It will hook into the pure \"chocolatey-centre\" which is (usually) more algorithmically complex, and does all the transformations from inputs to outputs.","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59439-5d5f1221-c4c5-44bf-8c71-44de05119e6e-1566236780"}

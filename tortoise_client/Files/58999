{"body":"That's my judgement as well. I was responding to your claim that boomers wouldn't get the quality of care they expect. Which is true but dramatically understates the situation.\r\n\r\nCollapse of the US economy, permanent collapse, is a certainty. That's because once the US economy *has* collapsed, there is nothing that could conceivably regenerate it. And what that means is that there's nothing holding the US economy up, it's just plowing forward on pure inertia.\r\n\r\nThe USA's sucking of 10 million barrels per day of oil from foreign countries is unsustainable. If an economic collapse happens, these oil imports to the USA will disappear and they will *never* reappear. The same goes for all trade (imports predominantly) which the USA is doing. The American service industry (software, finance, you name it) will be wiped out and nothing will restart it.\r\n\r\nThe USA's sacrifice is Europe's gain so the millions of Americans who will die will provide a comfortable transition for Europeans as the EU switches to a post-oil economy. The 10 mbpd freed up will provide a healthy 10-20 year cushion for Europe. The price of oil will drop like a rock but the hysteria around global warming will become useful in the laying out of a sound energy policy based on mass transit and nuclear power.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vc4j","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166684950,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"richardkulisz","edited":false,"id":"cvlil","parent_id":"t1_cvcrl","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809091,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42774-218e96c0-5342-49c1-95a9-6e5b70182272-1566236774"}

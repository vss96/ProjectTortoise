No offer of \"peace with Israel\" has ever been deemed to be legitimate. Those nations, like Egypt, that have the autocratic strongmen nessisary to have normal relations with Israel have done so. Pretty much the rest of the Arab world (including the population of Egypt) is against peace with Israel so the despots and tyrannical Muslim leaders simply make false promises of peace with Israel. These promises are false because the despots making them have no intention of doing the things that would prove they are serious. Like kicking Hamas and Hezbollah, which REFUSE to recognize the existence of Israel, out of their countries.\r\n\r\nLet's face it. The Arab world and the American LEFT must continue to blame Israel for all the problems in the Middle East. That way they can continue to turn away from the mirror that would show them that fanatical Islam is 100% to blame for the condition of that region of the world.","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42208-d57d10fb-c6bf-46b7-afa0-62fef3ee9290-1566236774"}

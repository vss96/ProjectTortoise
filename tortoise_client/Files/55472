The federal government does provide long-run budget projections. It projects that the federal debt held by the public will reach 249 percent of GDP in 2075. This is more than double the maximum reached during World War II and nearly four times its current level. Most of this increase is due to projected increases in entitlement spending and the resulting interest on the debt. It is worth noting that this is a projection, not a prediction. This projection assumes normal economic conditions and that government policies will follow current law. The stress of a quadrupling of the debt would likely cause one or both of these items to **change**.\r\n\r\nWhile the U.S. national debt is the world's largest in absolute size, a more accurate measure is that of its size relative to the nation's GDP. When the national debt is put into this perspective it appears considerably less today than in past years, particularly during World War II. By this measure, it is also considerably less than those of other industrialized nations such as Japan and roughly equivalent to those of several Western European nations.","controversiality":0,"ups":24,"score":24,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166526736,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38003-255abd6c-c54a-4d10-be95-4ec68424c17e-1566236772"}

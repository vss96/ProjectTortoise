The basic idea, for those not familiar with WASH, is that you simply contruct a tree of nested objects representing your HTML structure, but you do it in a real programming language like Haskell or Python rather than some sort of braindead HTML template crap. For instance:\r\n\r\nH2(\r\n  u\"rating for\",\r\n  A( rating.employer.employer_name, href = u\"/employers/%s\" % rating.employer.id )\r\n)\r\n\r\nThis declares an HTML H2 header containing some text and an A HREF link.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you just *delcare* your HTML page, using all the comfortable functional elements of your language toolchest, such as list comprehensions to generate rows of HTML tables. Anyway, it's one of those things you really have to try to appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe one downside of this approach is you can't load HTML templates into external apps like Dreamweaver. But if you can't afford a UI designer yet, that doesn't really matter. :)","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50451-9d0c9ca8-b136-425d-adf7-536d465edc7b-1566236778"}

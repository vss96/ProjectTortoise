I can imagine a number of ways in which you can have an that situation. Most of which revolve around undercover work... As hello(?) pointed out it has happened in the past.\r\n\r\nFurther time and time again it has been shown people who are tortured tell the interrogator what he thinks he wants to hear--which is why its generally considered a poor method of extracting information. The one notable exception would, of course, be the ticking time bomb situation when you certainly have the correct guy with the correct information. He will certainly \"tell you what will make it stop.\" In this case that would be the desired information.\r\n\r\nIf he is able to lie then you aren't doing a good job of torturing the person.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_v9pw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808959,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"cveql","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvc1p","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39290-81e7fe35-e5f0-4cff-a58b-c56e6dcdbf81-1566236773"}

Girls can hit puberty as young as 9 thanks to a mix of fast-food and artificial hormones that remain in certain meats (if you believe the hype).\r\n\r\nTo explain why it increased is probably because of the move down the food chain. You get a lot more fat eating a pig than you do the equivalent nutritional amount of cereals. The switch to agriculture also saw an increase in population without a vast increase in the amount of food produced, it was only when processes of industrialisation began (I mean mass use of beasts of burden and plows, not the invention of the tractor) that the amount of fat people could develop started increasing.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that when the age drops low it's usually followed by some sort of cultural expansion. In ancient Rome boys were said to mature at 13, and girls expected to be similar, which was followed by a vast growth of their empire. Similarly in europe when this happened you got the expansion of the British, Dutch, French and Spanish empires.\r\n\r\nIronically these are usually linked to signs of discontent with the mass exodus of people and not contentment, but that's the way of the world.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wdrb","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809687,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwf80","id":"cwgy2","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58827-ecb3ac5b-45ac-41c8-9951-2d89b4755573-1566236780"}

One thing I prefer about the bootleggers is that they don't try to exert any creative control or artistic direction over the music.  Most of the money that goes into the labels gets spent on marketing and promotion which benefits me not at all.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167446234,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58025-d0078457-f4b3-4a5a-9127-210701c41e07-1566236780"}

We laugh at it so that we don't feel bad about it.  If we were close friends with Lucious Pusey or if he were in the room (by the way, he's a linebacker, so I don't think anyone would be laughing if he were in the room) we might realize that it's a situation where actually feeling bad is required.\r\n\r\nBut as strangers?

{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vx5n","stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"body":"Agnosticism isn't really a third alternative. In the question \"is there a god?\" there's only two options. The atheist finds \"no\" the most likely answer. The theist finds \"yes\" the most likely answer. The agnostic recognises that he doesn't know for sure - yet he still finds one more likely than the other.\r\n\r\nFor example, I don't believe in a god. I do, however, recognise that science doesn't hold the answers to all questions yet (such as the question of what caused the universe, or indeed if there is a cause). Since I believe in science, I suspend my judgment of this question until science has a good answer. So, though I find the idea of an intelligent designer to be stupid and extremely unlikely, I could label myself an \"agnostic atheist\".\r\n\r\nYou could also believe in a god but recognise that you have no proof. In that case, you'd be an agnostic theist. So the views are clearly compatible. Theism and Atheism says something about your position on the question \"is there a god\"; agnosticism says something about your position on the question \"can we know for sure?\".","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167013148,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvyh9","parent_id":"t1_cvxcw","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809338,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49295-c062defa-6e5f-4f85-851f-2ffd7dc2bff5-1566236777"}

Can you really not see that?\r\n\r\nWhich ones? His illiterate and uninspired motivational speechs to sleeping 5th graders in inner city schools? (Never mind the message to them that to get out of a murder rap, you just have to pretend to *change*)\r\n\r\nOr as another cog in the great american economy as he turns $5.15 of raw, stupid, human labor into value-added french fries, raising the standard of living for all of our citizens?\r\n\r\nBut let's suppose for a moment he really can contribute. Let's say he has the goddamned cure for cancer, and he's such a fucking genius that even if we're willing to wait another thousand years, only he could invent it. And to make it better, me, yours truly, I have terminal brain cancer with 2 weeks to live. \r\n\r\nEven then.\r\n\r\nI would rather die than to give him a free homocide. And I'm only assuming he gets the one free. Truth told, anyone with contributions that we just can't live without, they could become tyrants. Because if their contribution is so incredibly important, what's another stomped bum?\r\n\r\n&gt; Without being punished at all, yes.\r\n\r\nYour punishment defies common sense. It either means lowering all punishments to be rightfully lesser than his, even grievous ones like child rape or assaults that leave someone a quadraplegic, or making the damn sentences even more absurdly arbitrary than they already are. It's too long a time to keep him from becoming an even bigger lowlife when he's being taught by other murderers how to do it right, or too short to keep him from killing another.\r\n\r\n&gt; Without the opportunity to learn from their mistakes, yes.\r\n\r\nHow much fucking learning does it take to know not to kill other people? It is something you understand implicitly, or something you never have. Most never do \"learn\" this... we're just lucky that they're too timid or lazy or too whatever.\r\n\r\n&gt; If you can't argue against something, call it \"goofy\"? Grow up.\r\n\r\nGame theory is pretty goofy. Who wants a game theorist to be nice to you? It's pretty obviously calculated... they want something in return.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165377034,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctsf1","parent_id":"t1_ctsan","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","retrieved_on":1473807864,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10659-a70d7567-8460-474c-a5fb-79e387206b02-1566236761"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt;No, print, puts etc. are all plain method calls in Ruby.\r\nI am afraid that plain old puts \"hello\" also works.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;ruby also uses for/in syntax\r\n\r\n&gt;Yes, but rarely used. Nobody uses the unsugared Python equivalent for for/in.\r\n\r\nYet again, if we are debating how python is used, then I agree, but you made the statement that ruby was more oo, not that ruby programmers where. Ill happily debate the first, but concede the second without hesitation. You have already conceded that \"its not a language feature\", implying that the language itself lacks nothing in OO terms in comparison to ruby.","link_id":"t3_u2mr","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165719657,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"seanodonnell","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuaho","parent_id":"t1_cu8af","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808201,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19525-e2e89b7f-b48b-4ba9-9196-bc5ab8adb62e-1566236764"}

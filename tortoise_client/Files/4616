Some of these used to be private schools, and some are newly formed. It's not quite like school vouchers, since no-one can pay their way in. I think that this system promotes healthy competition, while some say it dilutes the quality of public (as in government-run) schools. It makes it possible for anyone to put their children in a school which suits their needs, without resorting to home-schooling. Btw, I think home-schooling is illegal in Sweden.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166134435,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"29049-f85c3d23-7fdc-4e2d-b248-a624bccac627-1566236768"}

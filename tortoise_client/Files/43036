This has got to be one of the most delightfully Reddit threads ever. \r\n\r\nFirst, you got your comment congratulating \"them\" for pulling themselves out of the dark ages - consequently causing rocky_m to lose his temper and go on a tirade against Americans, fiercely defending Islam (nevermind the original comment didn't actually mention Islam) and naturally score nicely positive rating, as any attack on US/defense of Islam will, regardless of relevance.\r\n\r\nThen you have some guy CamelCasingHisMessage for some reason and someone retorts that clitoris mutilation on young girls == interrogating suspected terrorists without habeas corpus - again gaining highly positive rating, for his bold attack on evil US.\r\n\r\nLater another guy is states inaccurately that sex is punishable by death in Islamic countries. He is quickly downmodded to oblivion and corrected - the death punishment is *only for sex outside marriage*, and besides \"all Abrahamic religions\" punish for sex - conveniently ignoring that no non-Muslim \"Abrahamic\" country actually punishes anyone for extramarital sex (I expect this statement will now be \"disproved\" with quotes of rape and padophile cases in the US)\r\n\r\nAnd finally, as any self respecting Reddit discussion, it is never complete without sticking it to [*THE JOOS*](http://reddit.com/info/tk48/comments/ctkbu) who famously mutilate their male newborn's penises. Obviously, this gathers the most upmods from latent and not so latent Reccists and will no doubt soon evoke some comparison of Israel and the Nazis or whatever...\r\n\r\nI keep wondering - did Wired actually read a few comment threads before they bought Reddit for its \"community intelligence\" value? Maybe they just bought for pennies for its amusement value? Are Aaron Swartz, Paul Graham and others behind this site proud of what they achieved? Is there a law against mutilating the Long Tail?","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473807748,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctma4","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tk48","author_flair_text":null,"author":"bhr","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7706-eb49b986-f445-4585-920b-136ec99b0155-1566236760"}

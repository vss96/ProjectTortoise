{"controversiality":0,"body":"The part you are referencing is in the letters of Paul. They are not part of the gospels, but are rather commentary directed at one particular church (The church in Corinth). Paul may have been wise, but no one believes he was above reproach.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that Christian belief does not include a belief in the infallibility of any part of the Bible. Of course there are fringe groups who do hold such a belief, but there are fringe groups in any religion.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vat3","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166549224,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"procrastitron","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvblb","id":"cvdne","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808939,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38698-8429a45b-0ef6-4d20-a3b2-fbfb4ed9ca09-1566236773"}

The \"access\" processor does nothing but memory accesses into a queue, while the \"execution\" processor picks up the results from the queue and does computation. The processors are designed and optimized differently. If it has time, the \"access\" processor can run far ahead of the \"execution\" processor, running down both sides of conditional branches to find memory locations to prefetch into the queue.\r\n\r\nThe idea survives today as [prefetch threads](http://www.google.com/search?q=prefetch+thread), without the asymmetric architecture.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165269720,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7616-cf590c91-e494-4363-b631-83eecea7fdab-1566236760"}

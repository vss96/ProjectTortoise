See also a recent book by a Jewish author, Susan Nathan, *The Other Side of Israel: My Journey Across the Jewish/Arab Divide*.\r\n\r\n\"Almost invisible in the international media, the Arab citizens of Israel have found very few advocates among Israel's Jewish majority. By leaving Tel Aviv and moving into an Arab village, Nathan began the personal transformation that made her one of that small number. Living among Arab Israelis has engendered in Nathan a keen awareness of their fortitude and courage in coping with the adversity imposed by Israeli policies and practices. In Israel's schools and its legislative chamber, on its farms and its job sites, Nathan sees Jewish Israelis denying Arab Israelis equitable treatment, relegating them to second-class citizenship. And, unfortunately, the unmistakable parallels with South African apartheid fail to register even in the minds of Israel's progressive Jews, who insist that Israel's Arabs must surrender their traditional culture before they qualify for equal rights. Such moral myopia, Nathan warns, imperils not only Arab Israelis who lose hope in fighting against it but also Jewish Israelis who risk losing their national heritage by succumbing to it. Nathan's concluding appeal for a truly equitable and inclusive Israel will stir sharp controversy by forcing hard questions.\" *Bryce Christensen, American Library Association.*","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808115,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu5yg","parent_id":"t1_cu5u4","author":"alins","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16946-e0f5c3c6-ba4e-4b57-a187-56484ecb0fcc-1566236763"}

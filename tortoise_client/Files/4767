(spoilers below)\r\n\r\nPoint by point: \r\n\r\n1: If the first things on your priority list are the babes, then why not just seek out porn? I like sexy chicks doing suggestive stuff as much as the next guy (if not a little more) but it’s not everything.\r\n\r\n2: This being Bond’s first 007 mission, I have a feeling that he had a lot more on his mind than nailing that first chick. This guy also seems to have forgotten that Bond spent a couple of months after the mission had apparently ended banging that little hottie he was working with.\r\n\r\n3: Again, this his first time in the field as a double 0. I’m sure he’s have more important things on his mind than schmoosing every skirt in the place… you know, like not getting killed…\r\n\r\n4: I thought the torture scene was great! Bond wasn’t simply allowing himself to be tortured, he was basically laughing in the face of death. At that point, all seemed hopeless. He was caught and had no out. So what does he do? He eggs his captive on and doesn’t cave in no matter how agonizing it gets. If that isn’t bad ass then I don’t know what is.\r\n\r\n5: The line in his fifth complaint “After all this time, Bond shouldn’t have to have M tell him over and over how to do his job” proves that this person couldn’t even pay attention to the opening of the damn movie where it’s shown that this is Bond’s first mission as 007. And again, since it is his first mission it’s understandable that he’s rough around the edges. Besides, if you were handed a license to kill and let loose on the scum of the earth, wouldn’t you find just a little pleasure in wiping them out?\r\n\r\n6: I guess the “charisma” factor is a subjective but the feeling I got from this Bond that I never got from the others was that he had a seething viciousness hiding under a charming facade. \r\n\r\n7: “Where the hell is Q?” … So not only does this guy not know that this is Bond’s first mission, based on the first book, but he also doesn’t know that “Q branch” wasn’t in the first story.\r\n\r\n8: Presumably, Moneypenny was at the office where she always is… assuming that the character existed this early in the series. Either way, seeing as how the plot didn’t require Bond to visit the head office, it would have been awkward to just randomly drop the character in just to satisfy a fleeting bit of fan service. \r\n\r\n9: The card scenes should have been cut down huh? Yah… except that the tournament was a central plot device in the film… and if you think poker is boring then try watching baccarat. The game almost plays itself.\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808345,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cui2z","parent_id":"t3_uhvf","author":"SpikeWolfwood","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23597-d89b3638-18c8-4a5d-a1b2-52ffa1d848fd-1566236766"}

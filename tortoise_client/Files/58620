One might argue that for computers to become more than \"helper\" tools that enable mass computations and widespread communications, they must evolve again--and one key may be in simplifying the process of coding so that more individuals are able to participate in development.\r\n\r\n&gt;BS: I think that would be misguided. The idea of programming as a semiskilled task, practiced by people with a few months' training, is dangerous. We wouldn't tolerate plumbers or accountants that poorly educated. We don't have as an aim that architecture (of buildings) and engineering (of bridges and trains) should become more accessible to people with progressively less training. Indeed, one serious problem is that currently, too many software developers are undereducated and undertrained.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u5pe","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808137,"author":"ehempel","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu72f","parent_id":"t3_u5pe","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17659-3b60287b-8456-47e9-a863-d184418c49f5-1566236763"}

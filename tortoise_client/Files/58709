It's like the hysteria is mounting.  Kids are sexual beings, not that adults should really have anything to do with that.  Little girls do ride their stuffed animals to some sort of climax and little boys do touch themselves.  The problem is that the U.S. tries to put everything sexual on a very tall shelf, which kind of encourages kids to try to climb up to get it, leading to accidents- if you'll all excuse the extended metaphor.\r\nLook, if we were all just a little more honest about sex, it's quite possible that the kids would be turned off by it because it's something \"old people\" do.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809548,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw9i6","parent_id":"t1_cw8lk","author":"liberatedword","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55090-92a16652-dd8e-4057-9fa5-71d7d297595e-1566236779"}

{"body":"Unlikely. The U.S. dollar is getting weaker by the day and the Euro is poised to take the lead. Why is this relevant here? Because the U.S. is used to having the bully pulpit in the WTO because the dollar has historically been strong. Everyone had to do business in dollars which provided the U.S with a lot of leverage in trade disputes. There's blood in the water when it comes to U.S. trade supremacy. I doubt the Russians are in any mood to acquiesce to the RIAA's (a U.S. company) demands when they can clearly see this weakness.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vtf3","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":9,"ups":9,"created_utc":1166898444,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"MelechRic","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvv06","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvu49","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809272,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47549-44dd89a5-f2ac-450c-b1c6-b6ff7ca57c7d-1566236775"}

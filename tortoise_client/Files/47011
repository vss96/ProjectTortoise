Furthermore, he, like yourself, is the judge and the jury, to handout the punishment.   \r\n\r\nYou seems to believe that people of Hiroshima, and Nagasaki were responsible for the brutality of Japanese army in Nanjing. And dropping of the two nuclear bombs (along with Firebombing of every other Japaneses city) was the appropriate punishment.    \r\n\r\nYou can surely believe that, as many others do, but just be aware of the shared values between your thinking and that of Bin Ladin.","created_utc":1167193077,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":7,"score":7,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cw2n0","edited":false,"id":"cw46p","author_flair_text":null,"author":"dmehrtash","retrieved_on":1473809447,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52286-e54cbc23-5863-4df9-aac0-a6da35201746-1566236778"}

This argument reminds me of the early days of OO, when people argued that OO languages were not necessary because you could do the same thing in C with structures of function pointers. Yes you could, but it was a masochistic exercise. I havenâ€™t played around with Boost, but I suspect the same applies. Trying to retrofit ideas from one paradigm into a language designed for another is generally a bad idea.\"\r\n\r\nModern C++ is an amalgamation of programming styles(functional is not one of them though), and I recent the use of the word of \"paradigm\"(it implies something that is not present in the programming area). I find that C++ has a fair support for \"generic\" programming style but most compilers have lousy support for it, and there is no other mainstream language that has support for this style.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_ujjm","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24374-e354841e-5830-446d-9d72-2c86cd3b27f5-1566236767"}

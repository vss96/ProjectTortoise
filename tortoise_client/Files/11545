TASER defines \"Drive Stun\" as \"the process of utilizing the EMD as a pain compliance technique. This is done by activating the EMD and placing it against an individualâ€™s body. This can be done without an air cartridge in place or after an air cartridge has been deployed.\" [5]\r\n\r\n&gt; \"The Drive Stun causes significant localized pain in the area touched by the TASER but does not have a significant effect on the central nervous system. The Drive Stun does not incapacitate a subject but may assist in taking a subject into custody.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164938884,"score":8,"ups":8,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ct6cl","parent_id":"t1_ct61h","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"wicked","retrieved_on":1473807449,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"292-4298c9d3-1986-46e4-b752-061b9d5b607e-1566236758"}

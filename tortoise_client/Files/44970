I won't let you down.\r\n\r\nIn terms of semantics, I did state my definition of a terabyte in my comment, that being [10 to the power of 12](http://www.google.com.au/search?q=10%5E12) bytes. Pumping the same algorithm through Google produces the [same results](http://www.google.com/search?q=%28%28%281000000+%2F+%283+%2F+8%29%29+%2F+60%29+%2F+60%29+%2F+24).\r\n\r\nGoogle's definition of a [terabyte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte) goes against the industry standard, [as you can see](http://www.google.com/search?q=1+terabyte+%3D+%3F+bits). Technically, Google's terabyte is actually a tebibyte -- but [Google values them both the same](http://www.google.com/search?q=1+tebibyte+%3D+%3F+terabyte).\r\n\r\nHonestly, though, I was ready to concede. ;o)","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165564997,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15584-bd03712b-86f7-416c-93e1-49dd098e565b-1566236763"}

{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tq4t","subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"Christopher Hitchens has been a lonely, albeit passionate advocate of the claim that Iraq did in fact seek uranium from Niger and that Joe Wilson was wrong to have reported otherwise.  It's a bold claim considering the general consensus that Wilson's reporting on Niger was accurate.  Some people have challenged Hitchens on his analysis, though he is sticking to his claims.  I recommend seeking out his articles on the topic- his arguments may in fact be bogus but his writing style is amazing.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165370742,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cts27","parent_id":"t1_ctr5e","author":"Shikina","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473807857,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10475-53676645-6ca8-4e5f-a0ba-ca042bf82b02-1566236761"}

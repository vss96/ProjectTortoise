The data sets that places like Netflix and Amazon work with are stupefyingly large, and they have to search through that data and apply their recommendation criteria in relatively small amounts of time.\r\n\r\nSo it's really a two-part problem: first you have to decide  -- from research, from intuition, from whatever you can draw on -- what criteria you're going to use to rank items for recommendation, and what weight to give to each criterion, and then you have to develop a storage system which allows very fast access to huge amounts of data, and an algorithm which can apply the criteria to those huge data sets very quickly.","link_id":"t3_uekb","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808440,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ubernostrum","parent_id":"t1_cugsg","id":"cun6p","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26057-b392543f-9213-41a5-9d69-51d034923823-1566236767"}

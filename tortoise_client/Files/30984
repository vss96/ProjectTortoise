Also, I read somewhere that Matisse didn't do all of its GUI work with pure Java, rather it was somehow using a GUI Markup language based on XML.  So, if the user wanted to they couldn't manipulate the Java code directly, but they had to manipulate the GUI through Matisse only--i.e., no rountripping between code and GUI.

{"controversiality":0,"body":"ONE of my objections is that I don't like bondage and discipline in my programming language syntax.  That's a more aesthetic objection - see my other comments for more technical objections - but it's really the one that means the most to me in my daily coding.  I don't like being forced by the language to follow someone's idea of appropriate indenting style any more than I would like a policeman following me around making sure I don't snort any cocaine.  Sure, I don't use coke, and people who do often end up ruining their lives - but that doesn't mean I enjoy the company (don't take this analogy too literally - it's too extreme, but it is illustrative).\r\n\r\nI like more choices; Pythoners and their TOOWTDI principle generally don't.  There's a good middle ground somewhere between enforced order like Python and chaos like Perl.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uhgd","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165905970,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"academician","id":"cujcl","parent_id":"t1_cuj6k","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808369,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24259-2fdd738a-4b5a-4d80-9a29-4ce4479a29bb-1566236767"}

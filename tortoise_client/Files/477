{"body":"I think the best argument against allowing the sale of organs is similar to the argument against allowing performance-enhancing drugs for Olympic athletes. The idea is that the transition from optional to de-facto mandatory is an easy one, and you have a collective action problem, solvable only by restricting the option.\r\n\r\nHowever, if organ sales are allowed, it is not necessarily true that creditors will claim your organs: many jurisdictions have laws that protect certain kinds of property from being seized to pay a debt. The pressure to sell them off would remain, of course, but you would not be legally required to do so, any more than a woman could be officially required to become a prostitute (in any country I know of...) to pay off her debts.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w547","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167345897,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"asciilifeform","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_w547","edited":false,"id":"cwasr","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809572,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55737-22c4cf4a-4363-4b82-a9f7-3e32e1dd446e-1566236779"}

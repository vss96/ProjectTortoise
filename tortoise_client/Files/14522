In this sense, I suppose France, Germany, Sweden, etc. have seen \"benefits\". A French dairy farmer can have kids who grow up to be dairy farmers. A French janitor can have kids who grow up to be janitors. A French bureaucrat can have kids who grow up to be bureaucrats. Maybe they'll even shuffle around a bit. They'll all do fine and live well thanks to a generous system of government subsidies, employment regulation and welfare. This mostly works since you have a well-educated, productive society. The pump has been primed, so to say.\r\n\r\nBut drop a million poor refugees in France, and a per-capita equivalent in the U.S., wait 50 years, and see how their kids and grandkids are doing. Flexible employment and the free flow of capital will make a world of difference.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tour","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807861,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"twoodfin","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctq3f","id":"ctsaa","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10601-477e1f2f-2fc9-4e59-b789-70c8f06172ca-1566236761"}

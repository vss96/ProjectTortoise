I'm glad I stayed away from early Windows and all its funky MSDOS.SYS, CONFIG.SYS memory reservation games. Networking on early MSDOS and early Windows (before WfW days) was a true nightmare too.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft only really applied the pressure when they released Win 95. The company became an evil empire after that with all this IP wrangling, competition FUD, really bad interface defaults guessing (MS Paperclip, anyone?), product bundling, funky EULAs from hell, forced upgrades, and the Embrace, Extend, Extinguish strategies. And then lying and committing perjury in court about how they fought their competition -- that didn't help their cause.\r\n\r\nYou know, at one time, Microsoft could have saved face and played nice with GNU and FLOSS, and everyone could have gotten along rather nicely, but now the trust has been so destroyed that pursuing this would be a lost cause.\r\n\r\nInnovation is not pursued in an environment where there is no freedom of choice. I really have to laugh when I see these commercials where people are encouraged to dream up ideas and use Microsoft tools to get them there. That's a laugh so hard my sides split.\r\n\r\nJoel on Software also had an interesting thing to say about Microsoft APIs the other day that I completely agree with. I think he said that he often finds no compelling reason to upgrade his company's Microsoft development environment. Microsoft keeps renaming their APIs over the same thing, and with very few new features added to make it worth anyone's while. There's far more innovation developing on the Linux platform, which is one reason why I switched to it. Another great big thing is that it got so danged expensive to develop on the Microsoft OS. In order to remain competitive in the MS developer market, you had to purchase MSDN Universal every year and get in all the beta programs, and kiss your spouse and children goodbye while you holed up in a room trying to learn everything all the time. You had to purchase several workstations that you could format and reinstall alpha and beta MS stuff on all the time. You get so sick of installing stuff, come up with an unstable OS, and all the reboots. Thank goodness I switched to Linux -- I think I would have lost my mind if I had had to pursue this stuff much more than I did past 2000.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t0wf","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807441,"author":"supermike","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ct5xc","parent_id":"t1_ct5sn","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"37-3cdea307-9f9b-4449-9b57-f03c7ba33bfe-1566236758"}

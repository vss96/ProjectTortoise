{"controversiality":0,"body":"\"for helping her with a film exposing\" - the wikipedia link provided does not that was the simple reason for the murder. The murderer did not have such coherent reasons.\r\n\r\nVan Gogh should of course not have been murdered; but let me put it this way, if *anyone* in the Netherlands was inviting it, he was it. Wikipedia even quotes him as saying he wouldn't mind dying, if it weren't for having a son.\r\n\r\nWikipedia:\r\n\r\nVan Gogh was a virtuoso writer of polemic prose. His often scandalous tone and personal animosities got him involved in a number of public law suits against other writers and public figures and got him fired as a columnist of a succession of magazines and periodicals, forcing him to seek refuge at his own website, called De Gezonde Roker (\"The Healthy Smoker\").This, also being the title of one of his books, was an allusion to his notorious chain smoking and to the 'politically correct' negative stance towards smoking in society.\r\n\r\nIn general, Van Gogh had a strongly nihilistic outlook on life, as displayed by episodes of heavy drinking, his open use of the drug cocaine and a cynical view of love relationships. Although he seemed to enjoy his life, he said he wouldn't mind dying, if it weren't for his young son, Lieuwe van Gogh. His last book (2003) was Allah weet het beter (\"Allah Knows Best\") in which, in his typical cynical, mocking tone, he presented his views on Islam. He was a well-known critic of Islam, especially after the September 11, 2001 attacks. He supported the nomination of the liberal (former PvdA Labour Party), Somalian-born female politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali for Dutch parliament.\r\n","link_id":"t3_v1y6","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166365329,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv3yj","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv37l","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808755,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33832-e25c548a-a866-451f-a119-f95138c6e062-1566236771"}

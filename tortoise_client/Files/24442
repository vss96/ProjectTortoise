I rarely see people discuss ideas. When someone disagrees with someone else they don't make a counter point. They so often attack the credibility and integrity of the messenger. That's why I am so bored with political debate. Few people discuss ideas. Fewer people listen.\r\n\r\nIt keeps a lot of people out of the arena of ideas, because they don't want to be personally attacked.\r\n\r\nYour comments imply I am a liar and a narcissist.\r\n\r\nWhat evidence of that do you have?

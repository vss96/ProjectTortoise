You have no idea how many users of reddit actually comment, and you really haven't done any kind of reasonable poll of even just the posters.\r\n\r\nPolitical leanings of someone has nothing to do with one's proclivity towards piracy.\r\n\r\nYou see a few articles on piracy and based on the majority of the comments for those, you lump the majority of reddites as pirates. \r\n\r\nThis ignores the fact that those articles will tend to draw comments from people who hold strong feelings one way or another.  Reddites that don't pirate (or don't care about the topic) *might* be far less likely to read the articles or even read the comments, much less post or mod people in them.\r\n\r\nYou got as far away from a reasonable form of accurate polling as you can get.  You basically formed an opinion, saw some posts that made you firm up your opinion, and declared yourself right.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w3m1","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57517-141423a1-95ae-45e9-a79b-002d6fa6c937-1566236779"}

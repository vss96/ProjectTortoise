It means to trust in God. I do not believe based on faith, but because I consider atheism to be absurd -- and I overall consider Christianity to be the best and most sound explanation for who I am, why I am here, etc.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to present to me a convincing argument against Christianity -- I am all ears. I would ask however that someone address what I actually believe, and not some strawman version of Christianity that *NO ONE* believes.\r\n\r\nThat said, my original statement stands. If someone *SAYS* something, and *BELIEVES* what they said --- then it is a belief! Its the very definition of a belief. The statement \"words are not beliefs\" is wrong -- provided that the words spoken are themselves believed by the speaker. This has *NOTHING* to do with 'faith'.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20938-81c4a091-9632-487d-ba7b-2d791c8f4c28-1566236765"}

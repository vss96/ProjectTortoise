But Ahmadinejad has been saying just that from the beginning.. (ie. End of \"the Zionist regime\" which gets translated as end of Israel and, incorrectly, as end of Jews in the Middle East) \r\n\r\nJews (and Christians) have been living in the middle east for ages before the Zionists formed Israel and displaced the Muslims living there..\r\n\r\n(edit: I am trying to find original (direct) quotations and video interviews of Ahmadinejad..which will make it clearer for those who have based their opinion on this matter exclusively on the \"media interpretation\" of his speeches/comments.\r\n\r\n1. [60 Minutes: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (link)](http://throwawayyourtv.com/2006/08/60-minutes-iranian-president-mahmoud.html)\r\n     - Please, try to ignore the \"voice-over\" by that idiot reporter (Mike Wallace). Listen to what Ahmadinejad is saying and he is, correctly, trying to talk directly to the US and western citizens ignoring the attempts by Wallace to divert the topics. And, to the best of my knowledge, he is absolutely correct about the Israeli occupation (of Palestinian and Lebanese territory) and the attitude of the White House towards the Middle-east and Iran in particular. (The only, IMO, incorrect part of his opinions is the denial of the Holocaust. But the logic which follow (regardless) is not wrong at all: If Germans did the holocaust, in Europe, why should the Palestinians be forced to pay for it by their homes/lives/freedom.. This challenges using the holocaust as  justification for formation of Israel..(not the peaceful existence of Jews (and Christians) in the Middle-east..)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd reading a little more about the \"Founding Fathers\" of the Zionist regime (and Israel) ie \"Irgun\" will also help for the uninitiated..\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun\r\n\r\nAnd the [Context of the Declaration of the State of Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Establishment_of_the_State_of_Israel#Context_of_the_Declaration_of_the_State_of_Israel) :\r\n\r\n   - The document commences by drawing a direct line from Biblical times to the present.\r\n\r\n   - The European Holocaust of 1939 - 1945 is part of the imperative for the re-settlement of the homeland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wif3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167539281,"score":26,"ups":26,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59662-d05762d9-fa84-49c0-b540-3be1d16a2bbc-1566236780"}

Also all four of his daughters have been baptized in the church.\r\n\r\nThen again, he *did* get kicked out of Brigham Young University when he was college-aged, and he used to be a wicked drinker and smoker before he got himself cleaned up for his religion. He also gave me a free copy of the Book of Mormon after I asked for it. So is he devout or not? I guess that's your call.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tpok","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165352178,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9831-4e7f4711-1d50-46dd-8d2f-4c053542eec2-1566236761"}

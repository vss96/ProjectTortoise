As for the cheating, well... as someone who got to the Top 10 without cheating I find all these accusations disappointing. Who knows what is true? The possible financial rewards of Top 10 membership (though none for me yet!) are a big motivator to cheat. I think Reddit users just have to be on the lookout for cheaters and downmod them.","controversiality":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1166399132,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34712-2f51b6fd-9c25-4d98-b628-f158d9a8fc4e-1566236771"}

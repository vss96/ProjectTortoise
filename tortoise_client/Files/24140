Nobody cares about \"fatalities per miles drive\".

No, it means they choose forms of transportation that don't kill people. Why don't you find some statistics for deaths per million miles **traveled**?\r\n\r\nAnd in any case, even by kilometers driven per GDP (because higher GDP enables more road safety), [the USA has one of the worst safety records in the world](http://biurchametz.blogspot.com/2005/09/roadkill-myths-ii-israel-is-worse-than.html).","link_id":"t3_t8ou","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807546,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"richardkulisz","id":"ctbkf","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct96r","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2966-e5b53ff1-b74f-45fa-825b-48ebff95e07e-1566236759"}

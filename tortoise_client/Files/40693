{"controversiality":1,"body":"I don't want to back up Alan Dershowitz here, but the main grievance of terrorists is Israel's continued existence. Israeli incursions into the West Bank and Gaza may (and do) cause individual Palestinians to become terrorists -- and that's a big problem -- but don't get the idea that Hamas et al would be satisfied with statehood in the territories.\r\n\r\n(Even though the above is true, that doesn't mean that ceding the territories is a bad idea. It's 100% unequivocally wrong that Israel remains there. But even after Israel withdraws, it will take IMHO a generational change for terrorism to subside.)\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tz0c","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165516919,"author":"arthurdenture","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cu0g0","parent_id":"t1_cu0ce","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808013,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14249-980c81c2-3277-4ce8-ad69-ee4cd53790cf-1566236762"}

{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ttwn","stickied":false,"body":"Irrelevant.  Millions of Americans don't remit sales tax on purchases they make from out-of-state vendors over the internet.  So 1,000,000 (conservative estimate of people who have made online purchases from out-of-state vendors) x $100 (conservative estimate of \"hundreds of dollars\") = $100,000,000.  A mere $200K seems like chump change in comparison.\r\n\r\nStealing from the government is no more stealing from the American public than stealing from a theif is stealing from said theif's victims.  They aren't comparable.  Theft requires ownership, and last time I checked, our government steals the funds they pay out as subsidies via the euphemism of \"taxation\".  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the millions who evade taxation by not remitting sales tax on internet purchases (I don't know *anyone* who has ever done this) are \"stealing from the government\" and by your definition \"stealing from the American public\".\r\n\r\nYou might find feigning retardation as abhorable behavior when its used to fool an unwitting individual who, out of their own volition, gives you a helping hand, but doing it to get a subsidy from the government just isn't the same.  Just because you're afraid to fight back on the State's coercive taxation, doesn't mean that you shouldn't or that you have no right to do just that (although you'll certainly feel the wrath of the State if you do).","controversiality":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165450345,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctwxd","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctv11","author":"AnarchoCapitalist","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807947,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12775-8cb29380-bb7c-41cb-87ab-c9bc881b5bbf-1566236762"}

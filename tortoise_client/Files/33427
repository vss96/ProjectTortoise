No problem!  We hate you too, which is why we gone out and tried to make a horrible, horrible world for you to live in.\r\n\r\nNow, go turn off your television and unhook your computer.  Stop flying planes and don't bother getting in a car.  Turn off all of the lights in your house and don't bother purchasing any new clothing.  Grow your own food.  Don't use air conditioning.  Don't use running water.  Stop watering your lawn and your plants.  Stop buying anything shipped by truck, boat, or plane.  Really, show us that we have made your life so horrible.

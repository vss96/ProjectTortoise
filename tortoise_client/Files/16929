A functional language would model that as \"this database is that database except that this row has changed\" - quite far from SQL!\r\n\r\nIn fact SQL is a bit of a mismatch in itself. Why talk strings and non-native datatypes? Functional languages are quite powerful enough to encode relational algebra in native functions over native data. Add STM and the only part of a database you don't yet have is on-disk table storage and fast lookup.\r\n\r\nI don't underestimate the difficulty, but I think it might be possible to build something like SQLite or Apache Derby as a non-SQL purely functional, purely relational native library in something like Ocaml or Haskell.","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49783-3c33457e-eb23-4c5e-9170-9d69506160dc-1566236777"}

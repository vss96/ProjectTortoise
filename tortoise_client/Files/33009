To the extent that newspapers have a conservative bias, it's because they're *pandering to a conservative audience*; if that wasn't the case, politically active newspaper owners would be driven out of the market by more cynical populists.\r\n\r\nYou seem to be attacking the study on the grounds that its facts contradict your feelings, and your feelings about the data it presents are simply misguided (unless you think newspapers would be growing in circulation -- blogs, reddit, Fox and CNN be damned -- if only the *Houston Chronicle* endorsed Obama). Fox isn't going to agitate for lower taxes if those taxes will be lower for Time Warner, too -- they agitate for lower taxes because *Fox viewers love it*.","link_id":"t3_u1yd","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808062,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cu32n","id":"cu33s","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15555-75c7c055-317d-4554-8ca9-7483b6ea9a38-1566236762"}

{"body":"If you're just looking for a lot of libraries, F# gives you access to everything in .NET.  I'm sure there are other .NET functional languages that do the same, but F# is the semi-official one.  It's based on OCaml, so it's really a multi-paradigm language, meaning it doesn't force you to use functional style when it is inappropriate.  Apparently it runs on mono as well if you don't do windows, but I haven't tried it.  My biggest gripe (which you get over in about 5 minutes) is the use of the keyword 'let'.  It brings back painful memories of old school line numbered basic.\r\n\r\nJava has a few functional languages as well if you want to leverage Java's standard libraries: Scala, JScheme, etc.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_u3p2","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":10,"ups":10,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165588822,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"logistix","id":"cu474","parent_id":"t3_u3p2","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808081,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15991-6c571244-8d3c-4910-b998-841153314d72-1566236763"}

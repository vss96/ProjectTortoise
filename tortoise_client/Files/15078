I'm not in the UK or Canada. It is private insurance, private doctor, private everything. It sucks. \r\n\r\n/Interesting that when you reach for examples of evil corporations\r\n\r\nI don't think companies are inherently evil, thats just silly. If more of them started thinking in the long-term instead of the short-term, I think we'd be pretty well off. \r\n\r\nAnd by the way, I'm not sure why you accept no services from the government.

On top, notice that \"Recently Popular\" is the selected choice. Other choices are \"Top Today\", \"Yesterday\", etc.\r\n\r\nThere are about a dozen other really good sorting methods on the site, used for things like friend lists, commenting, topic-based stories, etc. It's actually quite amusing how few people realize that there's more functionality built into the site that they give it credit for. \r\n\r\nFor example, about half a year ago, a site appeared called \"Digg Games\", which was basically a collection of all the Flash game links that made it to the front page, sorted in order of popularity. Digg users all embraced that site, completely oblivious to the fact that Digg itself allows you to display those same exact links (in the same exact sorting order) if you just take the effort to learn how to use the site correctly.\r\n\r\nThe user-friendliness is all there, it's just people don't know they have access to all those features. And it's not like they're hidden, either. As I said above, the feature YOU would like is one click away, located on the very top of the main page. It's silly.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvsi","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13987-51387931-65ca-4c09-bd54-442b5968ad72-1566236762"}

As a Freemason in good standing, I got 3 sentences into that article and gave up.\r\n\r\n1. We aren't a secret society. We have frickin' websites, for crying out loud.\r\n\r\n2. The idea that we have a live video feed between lodges is simply surreal. Why? \r\n\r\nI suppose Turkish masons could be different. (Despite the mythology, Masons are not one unified organization - the masons in each country are independent of masons in other countries, in the US, the masons in each *state* are independent of the masons in other states.) But again, why would they need it? That's like saying the Boy Scouts have a supercomputer cluster - it makes no sense.\r\n\r\nI realize it's a lot of fun to imagine Masons are actually Satanists who control the world via occult rituals and secretive networks, but the only door the Masons opened for me was a chance to donate time and energy to disabled kids, and to kids in the local Shrine hospital.

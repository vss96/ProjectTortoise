Not in Vegas or online poker rooms, but on a betterment program called college. Their hope is that the monies they are spending will allow them to earn more money over their lifetime. Many are paying for this wager by amassing a mountain of debt that will take years to pay off. Is it a good wager? Conventional wisdom says so, but with $67 billion on the line (and that's debt accumulated in just one year by college attendees) we should have more than conventional wisdom or parental pressures to guide the way to smart economic decisions.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u476","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15994-a0fe6337-50bd-4b39-ae7c-0451842e67b2-1566236763"}

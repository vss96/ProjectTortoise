The point I wanted to make, I guess, is that the problem Schneier dismisses quite readily (\"just look for English text\") is, in fact, not trivial, even if not very hard either. Since the decryption problem complexity is frequently quantified in terms of the key length, the extra work required to recognize when the decryption is successful can be seen as adding some bits to the key.\r\n\r\n&gt; (You've \"cheated\" by sending a critical part of the plaintext on this hypothetical perfect information channel. If such a thing exists, why not send the entire message on  that channel? Or failing that, use it to generate a one-time pad?)\r\n\r\nMaybe I was not very clear, but I was referring to the practical aspects of actually decrypting an intercepted message. You are looking at the problem from a purely theoretical point of view. For example, if I want to improve my odds of communicating safely with my agents on the field, I might instruct them to \"add PKZip headers\" (or something) to every file they get from me. So it is feasible to have a perfect channel in practice, that can be used only once, since I instruct them before deploying them.\r\n\r\nBTW, I actually received a response from Schneier. He very succinctly told me my questions are irrelevant because most people encrypt plaintext with known headers :D  I wonder if that applies to criminals and terrorists too.","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166321265,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33178-595a099e-264d-41b6-88ab-df4d5c86a9d6-1566236770"}

{"body":"Exactly!  People are demanding more fruits, vegetables, and leaner cuts of meat.\r\n\r\nFor example, I remember when flank steak was almost free and now, with the increased popularity of stir-fry, it is one of the more expensive cuts.\r\n\r\nAlso, until Buffalo Wings came along you could buy wings for almost nothing.\r\n\r\nFinally, with the influx of various immigrants I am seeing cuts of meat on display that used to rarely be put out for human consumption such as tripe, tongue, and kidneys (I notice them because of my English background).  In America those cuts used to go to hot-dogs and such.  Today they are moving up the price chart as the demand increases.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tol1","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165332370,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"coldwarrior","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctp65","edited":false,"id":"ctpan","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807805,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9029-49f00fb8-3489-44fd-a0a4-62be4c649a94-1566236760"}

It would seem odd to me for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1. \"I've spent a little time learning Java so far, and have a general idea of how the language works\": Slava Pestov wrote the jEdit text editor, a complete, extensible editor written in Java.  That qualifies as a while lot more that a \"general idea of how the language works.\"\r\n\r\n2. I don't think Slava would care why people like Java: the real Slava Pestov is fed up with Java and went and wrote his own programming language, Factor.  That language is not even mentionned in the original post.\r\n\r\nIs it possible someone stole his password?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w6qn","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167353763,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55953-bb225410-d5f2-4ff8-b171-abeaf6620bf0-1566236779"}

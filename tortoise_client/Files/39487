If you are, there is not a problem.\r\n\r\nWell, even for those familiar with the conventions can easily have trouble parsing them. Even discounting the crowded appearence of most regexes, there is the wide variety of regex syntax variants to consider -- when do I need a slash to make this character work, when do I need a slash to quote it? And it is silly to discount the crowded appearence, anyway. Whitespace helps -- a lot.\r\n\r\nP.S.: The term \"line noise\" is usually used with regard to code that *looks* a bit like line noise, or maybe like a cartoon cursing, based on the relative amounts and positions of whitespace, alphanumerics, and punctuation. So, BASIC would look relatively line-noise free, but is awful. Perl looks more like line noise, but is an okay language.\r\n\r\nOkay, so I guess ricercar's argument for that being line noise sucks...","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34700-318b46e8-935e-4297-8a50-d9f8b7003f78-1566236771"}

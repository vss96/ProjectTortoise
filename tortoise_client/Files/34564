Its [case classes](http://scala.epfl.ch/intro/caseclasses.html) allow you to model the Maybe type very nicely, and even more importantly, it supports pattern matching. It's also designed to interoperate nicely with the JRE. If I recall correctly, you automatically have access to all Java code and libraries from Scala. The other direction is a little shakier, but should work if you constrain what you're using from the Java side to classes which are not using the more advanced features of Scala.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808582,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cuuv1","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uusl","author_flair_text":null,"author":"cgibbard","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29704-6021a2e0-4b96-41a0-8258-1706f8c896c9-1566236769"}

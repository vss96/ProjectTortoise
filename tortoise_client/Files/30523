Even a language with a fraction of the power like VB was able to come up with easier to use libraries for the common cases.\r\n\r\nAnd the throws clause makes inheritance virtually impossible for non-trival uses. You cannot even use most of the interfaces \"the right way\" because they don't throw the exception the your implementation does. End result, everything is wrapped in a runtime exception. Look at J2EE local vs remote interfaces for a good example of the needless pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808571,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cutv1","id":"cuu8p","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"grauenwolf","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29357-48598a19-eaf5-4b88-952b-657297c26137-1566236769"}

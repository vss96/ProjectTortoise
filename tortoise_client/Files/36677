{"controversiality":0,"body":"That particular misfeature is actually very useful, because one of the most common uses for string concatenation is debugging statements, and you don't want things to throw exceptions or silently fail while you're debugging.  There've been many instances where I could quickly track down a problem because a println said \"null\" when the variable should not have been.\r\n\r\nFor correctness, I think that things like [nearly all binary searches are broken](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html) to be worse.  That, and Sun occasionally not QAing a release (1.3 Swing was terrible), so that functions that were in the Java Tutorial worked but ones that were merely JavaDocced didn't behave as specified.  Or how you can (could?  again, 1.3) segfault a JVM by calling one of those methods labeled \"This method is public as an implementation side effect.\"  I wonder if their security managers take *that* into account.\r\n\r\nThe various interface misfeatures and type-theory violations are a whole other can of worms.  Some parts of Java are really well-architected, but others are just total messes.","link_id":"t3_uml8","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166048381,"score":4,"ups":4,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cup8j","parent_id":"t1_cuorv","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808478,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26944-b30978ca-31d8-40c1-a2d3-53f66283ce6a-1566236768"}

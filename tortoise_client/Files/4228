{"body":"Well, I'm not 'the media' at all. As a matter of fact, the main stream media was not, fot the most part, in attendance. \r\n\r\nThe concept of 'peak oil' has nothing to do with oil 'running out'. There will always be oil left, it was just not be economical to extract. Once it takes the energy from one barrel of oil to extract another barrel of oil from the ground, production on that particular field will cease, no matter how much is left.\r\n\r\nPeak Oil is the idea that the most easily recoverable oil (the first 50%) has already been extracted from the ground. The last 50% is more expensive to extract, takes longer to extract (tar sands), exists in geographically forbidding places like the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, tar sands in Canada and Venezuela and unstable/dangerous areas like the Middle East.\r\n\r\nAs far a refining capacity, that is a problem in the US, especially given the refineries built in and around the hurricane prone Gulf states. As far as I know, there is no significant refining capacity being added here in the US.\r\n\r\nSince we are witnessing the beginning of the collapse of the US Dollar, the government won't have a choice but to scale back military spending unless they just decide that we will literally have to fight other countries over access to hydrocarbon energy.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wbb2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167584289,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"crimius","parent_id":"t1_cwewc","id":"cwjxk","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809742,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60287-d288ad9d-8eeb-4e29-9063-7ee9f25fba7a-1566236780"}

{"body":"Actually Ford sells very well in the UK because they have a reputation of making cars that actually last. I just sold my car for £750 ($1500) 4th hand and we bought it for around £1150 (2nd hand) around five years and a few ten thousand miles ago, the reason it didn't end up near £200 like any other third hand car was because it was a Ford Fiesta (diesel) and for anyone who hasn't had one they're almost unbreakable.\r\n\r\nThe worst that happened was a flat battery (and usual wear with age that the MOT checks for), because it's a diesel the thing was up and running after a minute. Incidentally it's quite fun pushing a car down a hill.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t4dt","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164935287,"ups":4,"score":4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","edited":false,"id":"ct655","parent_id":"t1_ct5q0","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807445,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"162-6e454d97-857c-4fd7-a1d5-b1a2d1e17aa3-1566236758"}

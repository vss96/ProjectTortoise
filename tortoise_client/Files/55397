I probably would've stood there and picked my nose.  But I did not overlook the fact that Saudis treated him and he's alive.\r\n\r\n&gt;The more people know about how Saudis really are, the better. One way to get the news out is for the Saudis to act way-over-the-top to white people, and for the media to cover it.\r\n\r\n&gt;Hence, I wish they had gotten medieval on you for making the wrong turn. It would have been better for everyone if some mob had beheaded you on some dustry street and it got broadcast on satellite TV.\r\n\r\nI'd much rather have people be aware of those who \"make the news\" and attempt to bend reality to what they want it to be.  So sorry your \"wish\" didn't come true.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166094116,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27779-5d6de66a-adbd-4711-890f-b1c62eef8533-1566236768"}

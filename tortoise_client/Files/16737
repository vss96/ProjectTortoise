There seems to be higher-than-average interest in theory, Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang, and a certain disdain for the mainstream software industry.  So I figured I'd post a poll and get a better sense of who everybody is. \r\n\r\nAnd yeah, I realize these aren't firm categories, and that someone might variously have worked as a professor and done consulting.  Or gotten a Ph.D and gone off to industry afterwards.  Or still be in college, but working part time on an internship or startup.  Vote for whatever you want if that's the case.\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment with more specifics, too.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t9kv","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807510,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nostrademons","id":"ct9lg","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t9kv","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1879-cb2ebe8c-5dac-4361-943a-b4ca2a891564-1566236758"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"I think this blogger needs to take into account that sometimes fathers really don't deserve custody and really should make child support.\r\n\r\nLook at my dad.  He beat all 3 of us (me, brother, Mom), so the court gave Mom custody.  Then he bitches constantly about money despite having received (I believe) ~$136000 from the sale of our old house.  He rents now and has never bought another house.  So why does he have no money?  Because he puts everything into Certificates of Deposit that he simply can't withdraw from on demand.  He'll have plenty of money *on schedule*.\r\n\r\nOn the good side, we get consistent visits and face-time with him.  He had to legally approve our move out of New Jersey to make sure Mom couldn't steal us away.\r\n\r\nI know anecdotal evidence doesn't tell much, but obviously not all fathers are some kind of oppressed marital underclass.\r\n\r\nEdit: Necesito dormirse.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvr2","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165466010,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"EliGottlieb","id":"ctxsm","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tvr2","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807963,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13160-eb6901a1-c4f2-4a1c-b09e-126bef9237e4-1566236762"}

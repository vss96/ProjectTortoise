Instead, said call stack is implemented as the continuation monad.  (This is in contrast to most imperative languages that already have continuations, but don't expose them.)","link_id":"t3_t1qf","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807474,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"pjdelport","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct2zt","id":"ct7mb","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"956-4c6c06b6-c038-4ff4-95d4-6444a9d46c31-1566236758"}

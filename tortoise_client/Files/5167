There was a buy button, but no indication of what format it would be in. The listing looked exactly like her other songs, which are not MP3s.\r\n\r\nFinally, I searched for the song title itself and found a *different* Norah Jones [Thinking About You](http://music.yahoo.com/release/37249599) with a buy button. Again, there was no indication of what format the song was in.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that they are not promoting it. They just want to see what will happen if some buyers happen to get an MP3 when they are expecting a DRM'ed Windows Media file.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808004,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu00d","parent_id":"t3_ty9i","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14058-bec2cedc-301a-4f9e-9b9c-5d76dbe7c677-1566236762"}

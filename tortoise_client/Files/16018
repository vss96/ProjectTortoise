Imagery has a huge impact upon people's perception of things.  Look around, imagery is used everywhere and by everyone (even how **YOU** dress).\r\n\r\nTry this experiment.  Find the dirtiest, nastiest rags you can find (clothes), ripped and torn, drag them through a mud puddle and put them on.  Mess up your hair and smear a little dirt on your arms and hands and under your fingernails. Notice I didn't say *smell bad*, we're working on *imagery* here...\r\n\r\nNow go to work and spend the day doing what you normally do, or head off to school or whatever you do.  But you **do** have to get around people, okay?\r\n\r\nNow tell me imagery doesn't work again...  Oh, that's right, it has \"no intellectual value\".  Well, then if you even **object** to this experiment I suggest, there's your \"intellectual value\" proof for you.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tap4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3409-bbb86c54-1e82-462d-bfbb-6639bacd1c80-1566236759"}

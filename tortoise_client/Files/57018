The 70s were a time of high inflation - got up into the mid-teens as I recall.  I suspect that a mid 70's inflation rate around 13% included things like food and energy.  If we were to go back and revise those numbers they'd probably end up being much lower  ( 6 to 8%?) and it would make things seem much better.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808867,"gilded":0,"id":"cv9w7","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv9uj","author_flair_text":null,"author":"UncleOxidant","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36853-0727a0c6-a912-4d1f-b12a-9464ba7a68ca-1566236772"}

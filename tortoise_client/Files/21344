America will retain the status it enjoys today. Do not be fooled by reports that America is losing influence and such; the fact that operations of torture to this extent have remained partially discovered by some - yet largely unknown to the majority, and the torture continues to happen unger vague policies of persecution of \"terrorists\" - itsef goes to show just how powerful America is. It retains an image of a peacemaker, even if most people don't see it as such in the context of the Iraq invasion, but if this report of torture on people is any indication then most of us don't realise exactly how sinister America is.","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1166583283,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvg2o","parent_id":"t1_cvcsf","author":"gumjo","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808984,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40047-0f177094-85ec-47f3-8fd9-bea6846e6256-1566236773"}

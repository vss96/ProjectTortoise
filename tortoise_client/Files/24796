The idea was to create a system of numbers that were relative to the totality of the set (infinity) rather than an origin (0).  That link is how you'd do addition in the system, where ae represents the set and remains untouched in the numerator.  Pretty to look at, but pretty pointless. heh","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tzna","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808019,"author":"wockyman","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctzs5","id":"cu0st","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14395-5c96b039-0108-4cac-a760-f9e563861986-1566236762"}

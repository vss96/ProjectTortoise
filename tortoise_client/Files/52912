{"body":"If I were a cop or anyone asking someone else a simple question like the one the officer asked and I was greated with a response like the one this kid did I'd be pretty taken aback.  If someone gives me a hardtime I'm going to give them one back.  If you think trying to keep drunk drivers off the street is wrong then I hope you get hit by one.  It's ok to not want to discuss your personal life with an officer but don't be a jerk about it.  Don't even think about replying that the kid wasn't being a jerk.  It's obvious in his voice.  This kid was just trying to be cool.  Police officers have to deal with drunks, murderers, child molesters and more.  The last thing they should have to worry about is some cocky punk with a chip on his shoulder.  It's imature and doesn't do any good for anyone to act like that.  Instead he could have said \"I don't mean to be rude but I don't wish to discuss that.\"  Is this kid this rude to everybody or just to the cops because he thinks their out to hassle him.  I wouldn't be surprised if this kid is caught for actually drunk driving in a few years.  He wasn't trying to help some social cause or be a hero.  He was just being a punk.  If you want to stand up for something stand up for it in a meaningful way.  Not by wasting an officers time.  Stand up for aids research, against the war, or anything that matters.  But don't make a stand against some guys trying to make the world safer.  This kid deserves all the grief he gets.  He brings it upon himself.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wgpl","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-12,"ups":-12,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167507530,"author":"exiticon","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cwh7x","parent_id":"t3_wgpl","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809693,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58931-608a75a4-4317-4d66-bdf7-f0430a49d60f-1566236780"}

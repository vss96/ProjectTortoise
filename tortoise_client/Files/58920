It's much more likely that the opposite is true. The whole reason that universities were started a thousand years ago was that the half a dozen smart guys during the Dark Ages were bored out of their minds by all the normal people. Graduate schools today continue to serve a similar purpose. I'd much rather be around someone 10x smarter than me than someone 20% dumber. Talking with a smart person is enjoyable and makes you smarter too. Talking with a dumber person is a hassle.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12787-2db36543-9325-4765-8e6a-14a8916dfdc3-1566236762"}

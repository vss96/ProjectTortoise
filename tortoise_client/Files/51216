I add () with 1 stroke \"(\", not \"(\" and \")\" as you thought :) - You add it with 1 keystoke too - Enter\r\n\r\nWell, there's an extra keystroke to produce that character, but I concede your point since : requires two keystrokes as well.\r\n\r\n&gt;Lisp has other cool things so - like cut/paste/swap/execute/comment/uncomment blocks without actually selecting them. I'm not sure if any Python editor does that.\r\n\r\nGood question. Yes for cut/paste and comment/uncomment, but swap isn't necessarily of as much use and execution of blocks isn't as useful with python. In Komodo they can all be added through macros, however.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uhgd","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165884591,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23727-2f3d6dfa-0abc-4b09-b28a-ead91f0b2dc5-1566236767"}

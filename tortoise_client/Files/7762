Those are hacks, if they are necessary if you write code on a bigger scale without running into refactoring issues all the time, I consider the concept of Haskell a failure.\r\n\r\nWhat makes them hacks?  They are used in many large Haskell projects, including GHC itself.  Some algorithms just work better in the imperative paradigm.\r\n\r\nAs for changing a bunch of code at once, I think Haskell could really benefit from an automatic refactoring tool.  Its pure functional nature would make one relatively easy to write, I'd think.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w79v","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809589,"author":"panic","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwboo","parent_id":"t1_cw94w","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56211-89da7ae8-e100-4e64-aa6b-98238c016190-1566236779"}

{"body":"On dying humans vs dying animals... who likes humans? Too many of them, anyway. Only wish the distribution of human deaths was more equitable. \r\n\r\nOn the ducks, this may have happened but no way of telling without video. I know it's possible because I saw this happen once, not with ducks but geese. \r\n\r\nA goose (mother, I assume, but I'm no goose expert) was walking her goslings across Rt 95 in Waltham, MA a couple of years ago, toward a reservoir. The goslings somehow made it through the rush hour traffic on the northbound four lanes without getting flattened, only to fall into the grating of the road water runoff system in the center of the highway. The mother was running around the grate screaming and honking in obvious distress. Since the traffic was already at a standstill, I got out to help. There was another guy  standing there with me trying to figure out what to do. We could see two goslings standing in the concrete drain pipe below, but there may have been more. I don't know how many goslings geese have a time. It hadn't been raining and the pipe was pretty dry, so they didn't get washed away. This was creating a dangerous traffic jam. When the cops finally showed up about ten minutes later I left. Don't know if they ever figured out how to get them out.\r\n\r\nIf I'd had a camera I'd have taken a flash picture of the goslings in the pipe and the mother running round. It was pretty memorable. \r\n\r\nI'm suspicious of these duck photos. Why not a picture of the mother duck freaking out, as she surely would have, and maybe a picture of the ducklings below through the grate?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tese","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165169271,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"anoncoward101","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctfi0","id":"ctgq0","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807644,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5173-f38373d4-afd5-46b6-9da3-3139c4705bc9-1566236759"}

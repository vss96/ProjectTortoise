Are you saying that the Queen of England has made good use of her inherited wealth? Do you have a reference for that? Even so, how does that mean that the primary reason she is wealthy isn't because of what she inherited? If she lost 95% of her assets from bad investment, she would still have at least twenty-five million dollars, which I would say is rich by most peoples' standards. This of course doesn't include the stipend she gets through taxes, or the castles that she has free reign of.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v1ex","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809002,"author":"frankieist","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvgxc","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvd12","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40494-6a857dc2-c3d3-4faa-93aa-963a320c07bc-1566236773"}

There is assignment (i). And there is change of state (i = 1 to 2). But it is still referential transparent.\r\n\r\nSo what's that about not being allowed to change state and assign? As long as your function is referential transparent, who cares right?\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if i'm wrong.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u1eo","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808069,"distinguished":null,"author":"grabmail","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u1eo","id":"cu3in","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15737-140978e9-023c-4bca-97a5-d50e396db548-1566236763"}

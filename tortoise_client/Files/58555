He’ll also get an 8% commission on any product sales and a 3% commission on any consulting sales. In fairness to Brown, he has repeatedly said that he was the fall-guy for the failed response to victims of Hurricane Katrina last year. The InferX gig is also not Brown’s first post-Katrina gig, as the NY Times reported back in late August. Still, it’s hard to imagine why a company like InferX would want to generate this kind of publicity by hiring such a high-profile guy.\r\n\r\nSo......he's gonna be in charge of spewing out more BS in his new job I see......and he was the fall guy for Fema's failure to respond quickly maybe because HE WAS THE FUCKING HEAD OF FEMA? Idiots that hire him deserve whatever they get in results.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39580-37c93910-844b-48e5-a95b-9ad0c28e3aa0-1566236773"}

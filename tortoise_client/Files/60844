This is the same thing, it just depends on what context, what period of history and kinds of cultures, you're focusing on.\r\n\r\nPlurality doesn't imply subjectivity. This is a common mistake people make but it's still a mistake. Mathematics for example is infinitely plural. That doesn't make it any the less objective. Physics too is plural.\r\n\r\nFor something to be subjective, it has to be relative to the will of an agent, a subject, and not merely relative to a context of discourse.\r\n\r\nSo for mathematics to be subjective, the result of theorems would have to be relative to the mathematician who thinks them up, and not merely the assumptions of the mathematical system they occur in. Assumptions which can be rolled up into the proofs to make them context-free.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167014263,"ups":0,"score":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvyi1","parent_id":"t1_cvvkw","author_flair_text":null,"author":"richardkulisz","retrieved_on":1473809338,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49305-14d97344-1c1e-4587-bead-d5ffe0d1463e-1566236777"}

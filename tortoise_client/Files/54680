And do you realize why at that point certain silent promises made in the politics today are eventually proved to be broken, so that there will be an actual bloody war? Are you just so naive, that you can't see it? \r\n\r\nCan you make the promise that Sweden will never become a purely Islamic nation? Because it can not and will not. Not that I care since I am not Swedish. But, I can guarantee a lot of people are counting on you to make that promise if what you propose should ever work in practise.\r\n\r\nAs a sick twisted variation of the Tragedy of the Commons in play here is:\r\n\r\nAt some point enough people will realize that to maintain their own culture, to get enough 'respect' for it, a few of them are going to have start killing people, **too**. Your dream will turn into a nightmare. It is a beautiful dream but only that. Religion is what gives people cover to make murder politically acceptable.

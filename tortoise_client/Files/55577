Philosophy requires evidence to mount argument as well.\r\n\r\nWhat constitutes adequate reason in philosophy is very different than what constitutes evidence in science.  There are plenty of philosophical arguments postulated for centuries from Plato on to today for the existence, nature, and immortality of the soul, pretending that there are no adequate grounds for the argument is simply bizarre.\r\n\r\n&gt;I'm observing consciousness in the presence of a living brain. Other people behave in a way that suggests consciousness, and they all have living brains, every one. I'm not aware of any account of behaviour that suggests consciousness in the absence of a living brain.\r\n\r\nDo you notice that you keep taking scientism as true by default?  It's really a poor philosophical model.  As has been mentioned, you can't have experiential evidence unless you die, so it is simply not a scientific question, it's a philosophical one, so asking for evidence in the way you do is absurd.  \r\n\r\n&gt;It's exactly this kind of equivalence that polarises the debate. I've heard far more 'venom' directed at Dawkins than I've ever heard or read him direct. He never gets worse than donnish and occasionally heavy-handed sarcasm.\r\n\r\nJust as partisan Christians tend to forgive their pastors rhetorical excesses, so too do partisan atheists tend to forgive the excesses of their favorite extremists.\r\n\r\nThis quote sums it up nicely:  \"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: A misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.\"\r\n\r\nThat is as divisive and hate filled as anything Pat Robertson has ever said.  He named his show about religion \"The Root of All Evil.\"  In that show, when dealing with religious people, especially at Chartres, illustrated how pompous, shallow, and devoid of empathy he is.  He has argued that parents who teach their children to believe in God are guilty of child abuse.  If you can't see how divisive and venomous he is you are a willfully blind follower as zealous as any cultist.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v6h2","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39568-e3f66a96-6a0d-4645-858d-b2bfe3913e58-1566236773"}

Its obvious that the townsfolk automatically assumed the family would sue, and acted accordingly (not defending their gross cruelty, just observing). Moreso, it didn't even occur to anyone to help them financially to get through this because they were too focused on their own needs and wants.  Worrying about having to provide a major payout, and a loss of 'tradition' because of the dangers, does funny things to a community.\r\n\r\nI think thats what i like about New Zealand (moved from Seattle four years ago, so know the city in the article) - there are no lawsuits here, because of a public system for accidents called ACC. It removes the need to sue over every accident, and it leaves people more compassionate in such situations because they don't have to worry about repercussions for every mistake.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809071,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_vjjc","edited":false,"id":"cvkhx","author":"Amathaine","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42242-6d333913-2f09-4e61-8750-348ca58a8e70-1566236774"}

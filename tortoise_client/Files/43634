For example, the author says...\r\n\r\n&gt; When I run across a PC laptop (pretty rare these days), I find myself chuckling. It feels like a Model-T, all big and clunky. In my mind’s eye it spews smoke and makes noises like ka-chunk and clang.\r\n\r\nYet in the same breath, the author makes this complaint. \r\n\r\n&gt; For example, I spent quite a lot of time and frustration trying to get what I consider to be basic tools - Apache 2, MySQL 5, PostgreSQL, PHP 5.1, Ruby 1.8.4 (OS X comes with 1.8.2, which won’t work with Rails) - working. The lack of any sort of real package manager, consistent location for configuration files, or startup scripts drove me insane. \r\n\r\nThis problem has largely been solved by Windows. Windows have MSI packages for installation. Windows has the registry and the Application Data folder for configuration information, the latter even supports roaming profiles. WIndows has always supported startup scripts.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to claim Windows is perfect, but I am saying if people look past the bias for one moment they just might find solutions to their problems. \r\n\r\nWhy cannot open source \"embrace, extend, and extinguish\" Microsoft? Because they are too busy with politics and petty insults to actually look at what Microsoft has acomplished, and more importantly, what they could emulate.\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165255669,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"ctkyu","parent_id":"t3_tixi","author":"grauenwolf","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473807723,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7034-1edb992c-d0fd-4f9a-b0c0-ab6c6f796646-1566236760"}

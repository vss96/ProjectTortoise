(There might have been small-scale incidents I don't know about.)\r\n\r\nOverall, these past few years, the relations between the police force and the ravers have become more normalized, each getting to better know the other one. Also, the governements have had a policy of integrating the raves into society, that is helping the organizers manage huge events while at the same time calming down the local population.\r\n\r\nThe situation is far from perfect, but has become much better.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165226831,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6279-152801e8-0bff-4d7a-8faa-624d90b6ad9e-1566236760"}

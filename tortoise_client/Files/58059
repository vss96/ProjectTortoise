Surely this would make him a laughing stock and severely damage his reputation. This struggle lasted approximately 10 minutes and within 2 hours, everyone at work was laughing at him. \r\n\r\nI wonder how many of them started laughing at the author of this for being so interested in the state of his coworkers' wangs.

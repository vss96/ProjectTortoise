It is not presented in the, \"55 ways to...\" fashion, but it does cover a lot of the darker corners of C and teaches you why certain things are the way they are. My personal favorite books pertaining to C programming are:\r\n   * The C programming Language (Kernighan &amp; Ritchie)\r\n   * C, A Refernce Manual (Harbison &amp; Steele)\r\n   * C Traps &amp; Pitfalls (Koenig)\r\n   * C Interfaces &amp; Implementations (Hanson)\r\n   * Deep C Secrets (Peter Van der Linden)\r\n   * Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++ (Franek)\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t5wp","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807465,"author":"cp1134","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ct78e","parent_id":"t1_ct6hd","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"776-46c175e1-cc38-4be7-b05c-8f5fb7e38107-1566236758"}

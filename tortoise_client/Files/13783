The ignorance reflected in my downmodded comments above is one more example.\r\n\r\nPopulation overshoot is a very serious problem throughout the world.  Population reduction will soon be a *requirement* throughout the world, as finite resources run out.  Most of those alive today will see this, you're children certainly will.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.carryingcapacity.org/checkup_datasheet.html\r\nhttp://www.energybulletin.net/4735.html\r\nhttp://www.hoover.org/publications/uk/2933321.html\r\nhttp://dieoff.org/page14.htm\r\nhttp://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3861/is_200307/ai_n9295892\r\nhttp://www.greatchange.org/ov-catton,malthus.html\r\n\r\nThere are many, many more.  A good book to read is Jared Diamonds \"Collapse\", which shows how human civilizations throughout history have exceeded their local carrying capacities, again and again.\r\n\r\nGlobalization (and other things) has meant that we can now do it faster, all over the planet.  These limits are being reached throughout the biosphere, with massive reductions in resources throughout the world.  This includes *renewable* resources, such as fisheries, fresh water, soils, forest, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is simple, the world's carrying capacity for human life (politely ignoring the rest of the biosphere for the moment) is being drastically reduced - population reduction will be absolutely necessary very soon.\r\n\r\nI well realize that this has nothing to do with the original article on this thread - but then neither did my comments about population reduction, which seems to strike Reddit commentators as being unaccurate.  The facts, are much different, however.  I would certainly support an educational campaign to reduce the population, both here in America and around the world.  I would certainly support this as a matter of *choice* too, instead of \"forced conscription\".  That this point was lost on the commentors reveals that people really *do not read*.","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"135-19e52252-59e5-4b96-8e40-8751287392f6-1566236758"}

{"controversiality":1,"body":"All I know about Mormon doctrine, I learned from the book *Under The Banner of Heaven*.  It is primarily concerned with a horrific crime committed by some fundamentalist Mormons, and does not try to cast Mormonism in a favorable light, and in fact dispassionately recounts many very embarassing aspects of Mormon history and doctrine.  And yet, I have no recollection of it mentioning this ridiculous story of celestial beings on other planets, so I am suspicious of that claim.  I'm not saying it's false; I could even have missed or forgotten that part of the book.  But does anyone know of a source which would corroborate it?","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ud3o","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165800053,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"throwaway","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_ud3o","id":"cudo0","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808261,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21199-e195c26e-89ff-48dc-bd5e-e1bdeccf48a7-1566236765"}

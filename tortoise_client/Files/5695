If you're wanting to see loans given out to every student regardless of their scholatic aptitude or ability to repay, then I guess you'll have to run to the government for that as they know better than anyone else how to flush money down the drain.\r\n\r\n&gt;I have to wait months to see my doctor unless I'm dying.\r\n\r\nStrange, I have no insurance at all and accept no handouts from the government and I can get an appointment with a doctor in a matter of hours or days. Probably has something to do with the fact that I pay in cash and reduce their paperwork by a factor of 10.\r\n\r\nAre you living in Canada or the UK where such weeks to months waits are commonplace even for life threatening illnesses?\r\n\r\n&gt;the real killers are defense department contracts with civilian companies like Halliburton or Boeing.\r\n\r\nInteresting that when you reach for examples of evil corporations, you choose two whos profits almost entirely come from government contracts (Halliburton more than Boeing).","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uopb","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808530,"author":"NoFixedAbode","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_curzh","id":"cus0q","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28181-cbe62c21-a361-4881-bfab-28d797a70213-1566236768"}

However, the latter has a very high likelihood of turning out to be a bad law. If it's just adding guns and manpower to the Drug War (tm) then it's likely bad. If, as it purports to after a casual reading of the bill, it does half as well as any other federal program to actually help the problem, it will only be merely inefficient and at least a little misappropriated. On a different tack: would it be better to simply spend $300M in educating the public in the stupid insanity that taking meth actually can be? In helping meth addicts safely recover? In addressing the reasons that people actually take drugs in the first place? (Homelessness, poverty, boredom, ignorance, etc.)\r\n\r\nedit2: here is your [this](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s.02590:) link after it passed the House and become law. I would consider it a success of epic proportions (other than the clause: `Nothing in this Act shall require the disclosure of classified information.`). But while I hate to admit it, some of Obama's other legislation does not appear to be motivated by that much more than \"bring home the bacon to Illinois\" pork:\r\n\r\n&gt; Because of the 2005 BRAC Commission decision, 15 F-16 fighters and 163 military and civilian personnel will be transferred from the **Illinois** Air National Guard's 183 Fighter Wing at Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport in Springfield to a facility in **Indiana**.\r\n\r\nI guess Luger and Bayh did their \"job\" a little better than the previous senators from Illinois.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vcwe","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39199-78dc1f6b-f60a-4f00-9d0b-bf724fa0adc3-1566236773"}

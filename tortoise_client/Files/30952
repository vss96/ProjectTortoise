Not sure if this is real or not, but even if it's not, the part about sharing this person's naivete with the rest of the office is just ridiculous to me.  And even if it was shared, what the heck makes it funny that this person was unaware of some part of his medical history?  Why do we laugh at people when they don't know things?  This kind of humour, especially in kids, is the source of self-esteem problems for many people.  Why propagate it in stories like this?

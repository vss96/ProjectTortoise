At our work we do something similar (at a different bank), and the transactions take roughly 10-14 days, plus they seem to lose about 10-15% of the transactions (money is returned to us after about 90 days or so).  All these are compelling reasons to use checks rather than EFT.  No, I don't know why the banks here are this way, but my personal bank is a major nationwide bank, while the corporate bank is a much smaller, more local one, so it doesn't just seem to be a size issue.    If it worked properly, online payments would be much more convenient.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809409,"gilded":0,"id":"cw27l","parent_id":"t1_cw1sx","edited":false,"author":"slb","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51183-71da1617-bb8e-4f9c-a45a-a9f0e70653e6-1566236778"}

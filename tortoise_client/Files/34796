This is why I tell my kids to not even think of becoming artists or actors. He thinks he's got issues? Man, I could show the guy some issues.\r\n\r\n* Both my wife and I had 4 year degree college loan bills. Our parents didn't foot these bills and merely acted as comakers on loans that we ultimately had to pay off. We also didn't have scholarships, unfortunately, because at the time we were too \"cool\" (stupid) to be propeller-head scholarship seekers.\r\n\r\n* When I married my wife, she was a divorcee with a deadbeat ex-husband who strapped her in debt. Some of it we had to absorb, and others we had to charge off.\r\n\r\n* I, myself, also had run up a small amount of credit card debt before we were married.\r\n\r\n* Eventually my wife and I made two six figure salaries for a bit but didn't take out enough taxes because we used the default withholding. Mistaken, thinking we were well off, and after we inherited free land from her father, we built this huge mansion of a house and for a bit were paying construction bills on the new place and still paying the mortgage and second mortgage on the old place.\r\n\r\n* No one wanted to buy the old place for what we were asking and so after enough waiting and panicking, we took a $50K loss.\r\n\r\n* The new mansion then had a column explode under the house and an earthquake of motion reverberated through the entire house, cracking a few other columns beneath it. Some of the house sunk 2 inches. We were the general contractors and unfortunately our foundation man was a fraud and had skipped town, so we had nowhere to go. We had to pay RamJack $20K to relevel the house and repair the foundation, but they ran out of cash before they got to the back of the house. They asked for $20K more and we didn't have it, so the project has been on hold for 4 years!\r\n\r\n* Our tax bill came in after we worked a year with the six figure salaries. Even though we had six figure salaries, we had stacked up a lot of construction and construction repair bills. We also had to crack an IRA. Somewhere between the regular (thus improper) withholding and the cracked IRA, we ended up owing $14K.\r\n\r\n* After hearing about this news, I was laid off! I then made nearly $0 for 5 months as I struggled to find another job. I merely collected $230 per week in unemployment benefits. We ran up more credit card debt to help keep afloat.\r\n\r\n* The IRS debt mounted and by the time we had paid it off with all its penalties we had spent $18K.\r\n\r\n* Because of many factors too numerous to list here, I wasn't and am still not able to move. Therefore, the most I could earn for a few years here was only about $45K. Over time and a lot of hard work, I was able to ratchet that back up to $60K.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough a lot of focus and struggle, my wife and I have paid down a tremendous amount of debt, have paid off the blessed IRS, and have refinanced our home so low and consolidated loans so much that it's not even worth trying again. However, we have a long way to go and a house that's sunk in the back, requiring another $20K to finish.\r\n\r\nThe long farm road to our house is a mud road full of potholes and we have fields that require clearing by tractor every year before they become a fire risk.\r\n\r\nAll our credit cards have now been cut up for a year now and we're borrowing against my 401K to help use that to pay down high interest debt.\r\n\r\nSo when it comes to knowing a thing or two about debt, I think my wife and I qualify. The reporter at the USA Today wasted her time talking about the wrong stuff.\r\n","retrieved_on":1473808888,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvb0d","parent_id":"t3_v7vw","author_flair_text":null,"author":"supermike","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37445-25131b04-0314-4c8d-bd53-3dd36351ad01-1566236772"}

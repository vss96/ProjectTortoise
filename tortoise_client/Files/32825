Like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;Officials at the McGill University Health Centre say the device, which is about the size of a flashlight battery, could last up to 10 years.\r\n\r\nThat tells me absolutely nothing. Have you ever seen a flashlight? Yeah, they come in all shapes in sizes, as do their batteries. Why not say \"about the size of a D-cell battery,\" if that's how big it is? Maybe this miracle device is about the size of a AAA battery, that would be pretty cool.\r\n\r\nLuckily, they show a picture. A picture in which the device is *nothing like the size or shape of any flashlight battery I've ever seen*. Comparisons like that are just lazy writing.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30869-74658111-520c-49ce-a2e3-23cb94c70bea-1566236769"}

And what strikes me is that, though this protection scheme is intended to eliminate piracy, it actually greatly increases the incentive to pirate content.  Right now, you don't really need any special hardware or software to play \"premium content\" at good quality levels, but with Vista you really need a high-spec system, and one that will cost more and be less reliable.\r\n\r\nThe upshot is that the demand for pirated versions of premium content will skyrocket, because the cost differential between not only pirated goods and legal goods but also ordinary hardware and locked-down hardware (plus licenses), etc. will INCREASE, and systems which aren't locked down and only play pirated goods will be more stable, cheap and efficient. Not to mention, of course, that with unprotected hardware you don't need to worry about the Big Brother in your computer, and the feeling that unprotected hardware is really hardware you don't OWN but only lease.\r\n\r\nTo me this looks like something which will backfire in a big way. It's really a massive incentive to pirate.  And, as you say, ANY hole in the protected channels is still sufficient to enable pirating. It's a waste of effort, money and both consumers' and vendors' time and patience.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vs61","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":15,"ups":15,"created_utc":1166881810,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47218-b0e32222-502d-4587-84b3-a0806e3e5ea9-1566236775"}

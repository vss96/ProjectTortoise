{"controversiality":0,"body":"So sexual harassment is funny when the victim is male? I mean, let's switch the genders as reasonably as possible:\r\n\r\nA bunch of male coworkers are sitting around the office, during work hours, discussing vaginas. A female coworker comes by, and they ask her a very personal question about hers. She answers, perhaps out of shock at being asked. They laugh at her and promise to keep it a secret. Later, they tell everyone else and the poor woman has to watch everyone else laughing at her. And it doesn't even end there -- for several months thereafter, she has to come in to work to find people leaving references to her vagina on whiteboards,  post-its, etched into tables -- and she has to somehow accept this and get work done anyway. Oh, and i left out the part where they show her German pornography.\r\n\r\nThat would be an open-and-shut case, and anyone who laughed at it would be called \"part of the problem.\"\r\n\r\nThankfully, i believe it would still be an open-and-shut case with a male victim, and since we haven't heard of any such case, i believe the story to be made up.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v3ti","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166448788,"author":"raldi","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_v3ti","id":"cv7iq","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808821,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35701-12b78840-af59-4b2a-b04a-80c8b08e88e4-1566236771"}

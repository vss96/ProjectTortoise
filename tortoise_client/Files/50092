So you should have no difficulty in backing up your claim that murderers are irredeemable with hard evidence.\r\n\r\n&gt; Doesn't have to be 99%. It could be 20%, and it's still too high. No, they aren't serial killers in the technical definition of the term. But I know what you meant (repeat murderers or something like it). And yes, they generally are. At a guess, it's at least 50 out of 100, and probably more like 75.\r\n\r\nWhy are you making wild guesses?  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (NCJ 193427 if you want to look the report up), the recidivism rate for people convicted of murder is 1.2% - hardly the 99.9%, 99%, 75%, 50% or 20% that you have claimed so far.  You are wildly wrong because you are pulling numbers out of thin air instead of looking them up.\r\n\r\n&gt; The rarest type of person of all might be one that can take another's life, and after realize that he has made a mistake\r\n\r\nAs the statistics show, not only are these people not rare, they are the overwhelming majority.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_trhc","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10598-6db3db03-b16d-4071-817a-251aec4e283a-1566236761"}

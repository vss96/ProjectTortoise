How irrational does an A player have to get before they are no longer an A player? I know people that have much higher IQs and GPAs than me but make decisions which to me seem irrational. \r\n\r\nFor example, my GF has (I think) a 3.9 GPA and she wants to go to law school even though she doesn't want to be a lawyer. I have another friend even smarter who recently seems to have started buying expensive things only because they're expensive. Theoretically they should both end up with way better jobs than me.\r\n\r\nThis is very confusing to me.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_t576","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164931317,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"8-6764a7eb-d7bf-4153-9120-9e2bdc0f2266-1566236758"}

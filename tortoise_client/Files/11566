The baby boomers are getting older and no longer need 4-5 bedroom homes.  Their kids are not having kids and therefore don't need 4-5 bedroom homes. We'll have a country of older couples and young urban professionals.  Who plans on paying current prices for all those houses in the suburbs?  I am in the latter group and if I buy a 4 bedroom house I will expect 2 of those rooms to be free, else I won't buy it.  If natural gas prices raise any more I won't even take them for free.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tvcu","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165443490,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12578-ed3be32f-3f4c-4e08-b8b6-33036da919f6-1566236762"}

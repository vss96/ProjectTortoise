Just a different breed of conservatives. Look at their targets:\r\n\r\n- Anti smoking\r\n- Al Gore\r\n- The Global Warming myth\r\n- PETA\r\n- Atheism\r\n- 9/11 conspiracies\r\n\r\nAt the end of every episode, Jesus was always the actual son of God, and there hasn't been ONE episode where they attacked Bush. Not one. They even had Bush saying \"we do tell the truth!\"\r\n\r\nThe show \"That's My Bush\" wasn't making fun of Bush, not once did they actually make fun of his policies or his real actions, they just did a stereotypical sitcom set in the White House.\r\n\r\nThis attitude that they are impartial observers is plain and simple bullshit. If you like them, fine. If you agree, great. If you think it's hilarious, awesome. Enjoy, I won't tell you not to. But don't try and convince anyone they aren't on the right.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tpok","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807827,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tpok","id":"ctqg1","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9598-cc075b6d-691c-4141-918b-2b89261fa58c-1566236761"}

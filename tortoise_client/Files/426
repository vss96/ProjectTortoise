{"controversiality":0,"body":"Sometimes it makes sense to talk about averages, other times it doesn't. In the case of exercise for muscle mass gain and weight loss, what they don't tell you is that ALL of the benefits fall on a small fraction of the population. For some people, exercise works like a charm, for most others it doesn't work at all.\r\n\r\nI am assuming though that co-sleeping is something worth at least trying with every infant. Furthermore, I know you did it wrong just from your description. You say that \"we moved our last daughter\", both your and your partner, yes? That's a mistake. The mother should have moved with the daughter out of the family bed. This way she doesn't need to wake up completely to breastfeed your daughter, something she has to do anyways.\r\n\r\nYou *are* breastfeeding her, yes? Because if you're not then you're trading your slight health problems from lack of sleep for MAJOR health problems for your daugher. That's not exactly compatible with being a good parent, is it? So assuming she's being breastfed then the mother has to wake up *anyways* and it's better for the mother to be near the child.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning is airtight and blatantly obvious. If it's never occured to you, I'm blaming sleep deprivation.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_szzq","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-2,"ups":-2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164936342,"author":"richardkulisz","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ct3vn","edited":false,"id":"ct66w","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807447,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"197-12912d34-254d-4026-8bfc-0868e773fa7e-1566236758"}

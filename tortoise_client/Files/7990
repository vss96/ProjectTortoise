{"body":"But the exponential (to an imaginary number) is periodic. It goes round the unit circle in the complex plane as x varies.\r\n\r\nTry this. Assume that there exists a function f(x) such that f(x) = cos x + i sin x.\r\n\r\nNow differentiate:\r\n\r\nf'(x) = sin x - i cos x\r\nf''(x) = -sin x - i sin x = -f(x)\r\n\r\nSo f must satisfy f''(x) = f(x).\r\n\r\nThat should give a hint that we're in exponential territory. So try f(x) = e ^ ax, for some a (to see if we can get it to work).\r\n\r\nThen f'(x) = a e^ax and f''(x) = a^2 e^ax = a^2 f(x)\r\n\r\nSo...\r\nf''(x) = - f(x) = a^2 f(x) (for all x).\r\n\r\nCan we find an 'a' so that this works? It would have to satisfy a^2 = -1 if so...","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_un8w","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1166031013,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jbert","id":"cuokf","parent_id":"t1_cuo0i","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808466,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26669-f52b9c92-7466-4430-bf1a-ce8d40701d12-1566236767"}

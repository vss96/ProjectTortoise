You can't hide from the truth. My grandfather wasn't a monkey, was yours? The United States has only been a country for about 230 years, the Earth can't possibly be much older than the United States (God bless it). Did the so-called \"Neanderthals\" or the lie that is called a \"Missing Link\" write any books for us to read? I don't think so.  The way that the evolutionary censors have taken control of scientific teaching reminds me of Germany, circa 1936. Their \"scientific\" texts have corrupted an entire generation of good Christian minds. If dinosaurs really existed, where are they now? So-called \"fossils\" are just clumps of sand and dirt compacted together. Read this book and learn the truth. The Earth is only as old as the Bible says, and this book provides the incontrovertible facts to back it up.  If you want to reside in a very hot place for eternity-----go ahead and disagree with this book. At least our President is a man of truth.  You're a liar and a bigot if you don't give this book 5 stars. \r\n\r\nI can't quite decide if the review is meant as satire or not. I'm afraid not. Scary.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wbp8","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":7,"score":7,"created_utc":1167404234,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56759-ab6c6c3c-4049-4ca3-8071-ef643e4486e0-1566236779"}

Often we end up talking about what unit of biological variation is important to study.  Should it be based on genetics, or on what we morphologically see as a species?  What about subspecies, which can be quite diverse?  How many individuals of a species need to be preserved in order to keep the remainder from self-destructing through inbreeding?  Also, some species have very low genetic variation, so should we put our resources into preserving something with more variation?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ucsv","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165855009,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22535-df327500-c781-4bca-8763-12ebcf320203-1566236766"}

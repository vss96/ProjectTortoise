But that danger is real. There's not much space anymore between buyer's remorse and rape, and women are so confused between what they're supposed to want and what they do want that they're left in a state of \"not wanting what they want\", and so confused they if you gave them what they really wanted (whatever that might be), they'd run a mile. \r\n\r\nSo women, we officially give up trying to figure you out. You can't even figure you out, so what hope do *we* have? Those of us who can get them already have friends-with-benefits who don't put us through this shit, and those who can't are learning that porn may not be totally satisfying, but it exposes us to a better class of women. We'll get by.\r\n\r\nWomen, if you want something, you need to learn to communicate, because right now, frankly, you're lousy at it. All this time patting yourself on the back for being the great communicators, and you've still painted yourselves into a corner. \r\n\r\nWell, we're tired of having to be perfect for you when we don't even know what your notion of \"perfect\" is. You know what I look for in a woman nowdays? Low self-esteem. That way, I can get what I want (sex) without being expected to jump through hoops only vaguely defined by her fantasies. She gets expectations, I move on to the next kinda-sorta-friend-but-fucking-each-other. \r\n\r\nMaybe if women knew how to say what they want, and to negotiate, then actual relationships will become feasible in our culture again. But express yourself as a fully functioning human being with his own agenda and inner life, and today's woman will run a mile, or however far it takes her to get to the next pussywhipped loser who she'll end up dissatisfied with and not knowing why.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tcpy","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165128999,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4595-e204e163-ea58-463a-97bf-c29050e75076-1566236759"}

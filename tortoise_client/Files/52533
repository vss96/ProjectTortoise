What bugs me is the donation bins for the higher-priced vintage stores that trick people into donating clothes that will be sold at a steep markup here in the US. The Salvation Army and Goodwill sell stuff cheap-- maybe $3 for a T-shirt. There are many vintage clothing stores that would sell the same shitty ironic T-shirt for $15 or $20. These stores use bins that would make people think their clothes are going to help others. Hell, I have a garbage bag full of otherwise decent clothes ready to donate, but I'm waiting for somebody to give me a lift to the Salvation Army dropoff spot, even though there are a few of those shady bins pretty close to my apartment.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't care if my old clothes are cut up and sold as rags. At least they're not going to waste. I look at the African thing in much the same way.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vo79","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809155,"distinguished":null,"author":"freshyill","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvoto","parent_id":"t3_vo79","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44426-cf4718a7-72dd-4de7-833f-ff467dbdb827-1566236774"}

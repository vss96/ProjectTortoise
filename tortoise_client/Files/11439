It seems unlikely he's going to cure cancer or create peace in the middle east.  Anything short of this magnitude of social contribution doesn't outweigh the value of protecting society from him, making an example of him, and yes, severely punishing him.  \r\n\r\n&gt; I don't call being imprisoned for a third of your lifetime to be \"weaseling out\" of anything. Do you seriously think it is?\r\n\r\nI don't, either.  Which is why I support the judge's decision to imprison him for 22 years of his likely 77 year lifespan.\r\n\r\n&gt; But you are assuming that this risk is constant, that it doesn't recede with age, time or punishment, even after total isolation from the peers that directly involved him in this crime. Why?\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, one of the reasons I support the judge's decision is that it keeps this monster off the street for the phase of his life when he's most likely to engage in further violence.\r\n\r\n&gt; I don't call being imprisoned for a third of your lifetime to be \"weaseling out\" of anything. Do you seriously think it is?\r\n\r\nI don't either.  That's why I support the 22 year no-parole sentence.   You argue that we should let him weasel out of his punishment with after a mere 7.5 years because he *might* have something positive to contribute to society.\r\n\r\nYou seem to have lost track of your own point.\r\n\r\n&gt; If you can't argue against something, call it \"goofy\"?  \r\n\r\nGo back and read what you have written.  You are arguing that a sociopathic killer who tortured a total stranger to death over the course of three days should be released from prison early.\r\n\r\nI *dignify* your pompous, maudlin hand wringing by calling it \"goofy.\"","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165436468,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12257-2daf5739-6de0-4102-bd64-d80d88be3230-1566236761"}

But that is a **huge** argument in favor of C++.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was/still is way too much usefull C code today for anybody to have the right to say \"I'll just go and write the same thing in XYZLang\". Being able just link and call it is huge productivity boost.\r\n\r\nSecond, OS interface is C. Any language and its libs try to abstract that away, but it's often a tiny part of everything OS has to offer.\r\n\r\nObviously, with C compatibility come C problems. Can one facilitate calls to C and lose C compatibility? I think not. The second you need to pass anything more than simplest arguments, you're in for a bumpy ride. JNI, p/Invoke, python's extension modules, whatever, are orders of magnitude more complicated to do than just call a function.\r\n\r\nC compatibility is more of a C++'s strength, than a weakness.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u5pe","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808211,"distinguished":null,"author":"Gotebe","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cub03","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu99i","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19801-f3d6141c-d237-46d3-82fb-94c9644fa4b6-1566236764"}

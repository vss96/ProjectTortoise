Without electricity you have no computers.\r\n\r\nBut why no electricity or engines?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Key reason for lack of progress\r\n\r\n&gt;More interesting to me is the theory that the widespread practice of slavery in Greece and Rome would have prevented people from trying to create machines that could perform human labor. It's not that having slaves kept people from inventing gear mechanisms -- it just kept them from imagining possible outcomes and applications. If you already have people performing all the manual and intellectual labor you don't want to do, there's no need to figure out what kinds of machines would be capable of doing it.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ttlc","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807910,"author":"smacfarl","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctuwz","parent_id":"t3_ttlc","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11793-4c87e3f5-2f51-4e5e-9146-af2b83c7c234-1566236761"}

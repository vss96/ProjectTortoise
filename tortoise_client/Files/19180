Cute little car. I just bought a G6 (the higher end one though, so it's probably not much of a comparison to what this guy rented).\r\n\r\nI started searching with foreign cars. Really, I did. I started by looking at the brands that are supposed to have quality. Everyone I talk to loves VW and certain Mazdas.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, I can't justify the purchase of any other car. My used G6 GTP has better performance than anything else I could get for the price. I wanted to buy a VW GTI or a Civic Si. Really, I did. The combination of price and features on my G6 beats out everything else I could get for that kind of $$$.\r\n\r\nThis is why I think it's a bit unfair to pick on GM. For everything they've done wrong - and there's a lot of it - I find it hard to beat GM cars, and I'm no cheerleader; far from it.","retrieved_on":1473809724,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cwiwj","parent_id":"t1_cwivt","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"swieton","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59811-b516321d-8bf5-4f67-aca4-2b165b29bf81-1566236780"}

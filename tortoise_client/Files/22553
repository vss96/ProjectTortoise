That is just riddiculous.  Also consider that this article said they only have something like 22 employees.  \r\n\r\nObviously they are able to do a great deal with few resources.  IF you have ever been on CL(which statistically most of you have), you notice how bare bones it is.  Usually the corporate business model is more more more.  Websites with all kinds of colerful stuff that flashes and blinks and makes noise.  CL takes the opposite route since its main competitor is a plain black and white newspaper.\r\n\r\nCombine with this that it would be nearly impossible for anyone to take a chunk of their market share since CL is so cheap or free and these guys have entreanched themselves in an almost impenitrable position.  \r\n\r\nWhat makes you laugh though is that these Wallstreet guys cannot understand why a guy would be happy \"just\" making millions when there are billions on the table.  Maybe some people just want to live comfortably.  Maybe some people actually give a crap about their customers and see no need to accumulate mountains of wealth you could never spend anyway.\r\n\r\nThe US has some of the greatest discreppancies between the have and have-nots, between CEOs and mailroom Joes.  These guys ought to be frightened, because like any success, people will copy CL's businees model where they can.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165873947,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":11,"ups":11,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cugge","id":"cuhmw","edited":false,"author":"BLACKINFIDEL","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808335,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23310-a96cae93-be9d-4abe-a75e-208039a4d6f4-1566236766"}

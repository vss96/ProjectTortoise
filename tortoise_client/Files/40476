Both are very expensive, for example much more expensive than MS VS 2005, or Borland Delphi.\r\nYou do realize that people paying this kind of money for development tools, find them quite useful in real life applications. Otherwise they would not buy them.\r\nI personally use Lispworks.\r\n\r\nSo i would say, of all functional langauges - Common Lisp is most useful. Because it has commercial packages, that include such things as IDE, GUI libraries, database access, sockets, multithreading, embedded prolog, multiplatform. And lot's of libraries, both commercial and opensource.\r\n\r\n","link_id":"t3_u3p2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165600308,"score":6,"ups":6,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16489-2c7c9f02-72db-4b74-9624-785cfc65c6ed-1566236763"}

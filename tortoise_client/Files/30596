Aside from the fun of making wish lists and staying up hoping to see Santa, I think being lied to and then finding out the truth later helped me to realize at an early age that I shouldn't take things others tell me on faith, and helped me to later recognize that faith in Santa wasn't too different from faith in God or Jesus. I'm sure my parents would feel bad if they knew their actions led to my atheism, but I think it was a good thing. I intend to tell my kids all about Santa and have them learn that lesson for themselves.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809220,"gilded":0,"id":"cvs86","parent_id":"t3_vr9a","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46121-66be93c5-ad0f-456a-8490-46eeb0c2b693-1566236775"}

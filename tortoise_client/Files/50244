You should learn Python so that you can see how similar they are (both are byte compiled, both have ref-counting memory management, both use _the_ implementation as a spec, both added lexical scope at some point in their evolution) and that the advantage of Python (aside from commercial use) is greater simplicity and consistency.\r\n\r\nFor example, Python doesn't have Perl's flip-flop operator '..' (and '...') (when evaluated in scalar context) and that's a _good thing_ for an intro class.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3882\r\n\r\nAside from all of that, I still think that CTM is a great way to introduce programming, even though Oz syntax is somewhat strange.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"772-0d44c7f3-4cc7-4cfe-951a-eff8ffc0e750-1566236758"}

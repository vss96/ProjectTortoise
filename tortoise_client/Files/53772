For homegamers, [this](http://reddit.com/info/vpcj/comments) is the other one.\r\n\r\nThe description for this article *should* read \"Idiots who think that store-front payday loan companies are giving away free money devastate families\"\r\n\r\nI don't understand for the life of me why anybody thinks that people who take out two, three, four paycheck loans in one pay period (when they get only *ONE* paycheck) are victims! This is no different than credit cards - all you need to do is rev up the Common Sense Engine, stop and think \"wait a minute...why would a company be offering me easy access to free money? What do they want in return? Ohhhhh, I see.\" A little bit of thinking and you'll put the credit card back in the wallet and keep it for emergencies only.\r\n\r\nThe thing that REALLY pisses me off about this is the ones who get screwed are the majority: responsible citizens and businessmen. Responsible citizens get screwed because if they have an emergency and want a short-term paycheck loan and are willing to pay 20% interest for the pay period, loans will be less likely to be available to them (if at all available) because of the people who thought \"omgwtf FREE MONEY!!!11!!oneone\" then went to Washington to cry in front of some Senate committee because they were paying the interest they agreed to. So if you find yourself in need of a loan and your state won't allow you to get one, you know who to thank.\r\n\r\nThe second group that it screws is the businesses (and their employees) who work at these paycheck loan places. I know we're all supposed to assume that they are devils incarnate and deserve not to make a living, but news flash - they are people too, with families and children and bills to pay, and  they are doing perfectly legitimate business in a capitalist society because they *give customers what the customers want*. Since there are no negative externalities (unlike a person who makes his living, say, giving a customer [Osama bin Laden] what he wants [a nuclear warhead]), this is a perfectly legitimate market transaction. A few irresponsible people who can't think one step ahead ruin it for a *lot* of others.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, as many economists have stated in print and elsewhere, there is a very odd discrimination in Western societies against capital markets. I've heard no real convincing attribution to this discrimination - it's attributed from everything to public innumeracy to the old Christian edict against lending with interest - but for some reason, in Western societies, the lending of money with interest is seen as scummy, tainted, and completely different than other kinds of markets, like labor and goods markets.\r\n\r\nThis never made much sense to me, although I think it explains a lot of the rather illogical public outrage against things like credit card companies and these payday loan places. Think about it - if some poor fellow went to a congressional committee with tears in his eyes and saying inbetween sobs \"I rented this car from Hertz and one from Avis and one from Budget and now I have to pay all this money even after I brought the cars back!!!\" We'd all think that was a little ridiculous. The point is, of course, that capital markets are exactly equivalent - instead of renting a car, you're renting dollars.\r\n\r\nIs there a place for government in regulating payday loan centers? Possibly. I could see legislation requiring them to print the interest rate big and bold where any customer can see it, or printing on the forms big and bold exactly how much the customer pays in two weeks when they pay back the loan. Other than measures like these, which make the choices clearer for customers but do not inhibit their freedom to choose whether to accept the transaction, this issue is all about a few people who acted irresponsibly, and how they are possibly going to end up making responsible people like you and I pay for it. *That's* the real injustice.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vuk7","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47364-22872810-1b21-4fcb-b44d-5a8b792df2c9-1566236775"}

Last I checked slots slots didn't pay out on a 50/50 chance.\r\n* Next he tries to compel you into thinking it is better to just take your college savings and invest it.  Fat chance mom and dad are just going to hand over money versus sending you to school.  So in that regard is it still worth it to goto school, because either you get the money for college or you don't have it.\r\n* Finally, there is the issue that parents could invest their money in 529's college accounts now and earn 8% then use that money to fund their kids college education.  In which they would be getting a hell of a lot better return on their money.  But he never consider that.\r\n* Sure a lot of people might be better of NOT going to school.  But I think it is better that people get out of high school and socialize with a whole new arena of young adults and make connections.  Chances are you will have more opportunity to grow and learn and make more money.\r\n\r\nModded down, very very bad advice.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u476","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16885-6d2fb62e-5d55-4ee8-8c94-8501acc8de09-1566236763"}

You read too much into what I said.  Thus, I must be \"making shit up\".

Those aren't people that serve as judges, with agendas and personal failings.  No, not at all.  They're perfect machines, programmed to provide perfect judgments of logical validity based on the premises of legislation.\r\n\r\nNo, wait, that's not right.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808014,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctycz","edited":false,"id":"cu0j0","author_flair_text":null,"author":"apotheon","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14298-338b98a3-0330-406d-9806-baa2e0ccb918-1566236762"}

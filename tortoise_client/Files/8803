Personally, I think the US media overfocusses on leaders like Chavez; democratic currents are far deeper than figureheads.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, what's Chavez's point of view on Telemundo's claims? (Telemundo is owned by General Electric, a [US media giant and military contractor](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=16).)

Unfortunately, Google News is spotty with info, so Telemundo/GE's claim is hard to evaluate.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807691,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctj85","parent_id":"t1_ctimw","author_flair_text":null,"author":"tayssir","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6272-7077d74f-4328-415e-825e-4cf4a7aab3a6-1566236760"}

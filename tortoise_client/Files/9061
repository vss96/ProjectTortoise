{"controversiality":0,"body":"While I don't think I would go so far as saying either man should get the death penalty. I do think it was the right thing to do for the country, despite what you personally feel. \r\n\r\nTry to remember the context. This was all coming at a time that the Vietnam war was wrapping up, students had been shot at Kent State and our country was truly divided...maybe worse than it is today... Rather than string up Nixon, in an effort to get past the scandal and the Vietnam war and to help America to heal, he pardoned him.\r\n\r\nProsecuting him would have been a long and drawn out process during which America would have dwelled on all of its problems for the last decade. By circumventing that in conjunction with pulling out of Vietnam he gave America something of a fresh start. Or at least the chance to move on. He sacraficed his political career in making that decision. Something that few would do today.\r\n\r\nI agree, Nixon did wrong. The law said he should have been punished. But the law also says the president has the power to pardon. Ford exercised that power. Could you imagine a better time to do so?","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w48y","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1167233605,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cw54i","id":"cw5k5","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809474,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53014-9f7d0903-56d7-4a3f-8547-9c11fb5961e4-1566236778"}

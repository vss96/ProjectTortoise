Gee, you programmed for a couple of months, you found a couple of bugs that static typing could have caught, and now you're throwing in the towel? Have you not noticed that all code, static or dynamic, is a seething mass of bugs? Even discounting the fact that you should also be counting the bugs never written for various reasons and the bugs more easily caught (IMHO testing is a lot easier with dynamic typing), tossing a technology because of two or three bugs in a couple of months shows a mind-boggling lack of perspective.\r\n\r\n(Note that I'm not claiming that dynamic typing is therefore always the correct answer. I'm just saying that tossing something because of two or three bugs, when weighed against the entire complex question of the total value of a platform, is not a rational value judgement. It's a sign your mind was already made up and you were just looking for an excuse to give up.)","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809218,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvs4e","parent_id":"t1_cvr8t","author_flair_text":null,"author":"jerf","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46051-0cd81f37-888a-4a4c-b278-a25545547b60-1566236775"}

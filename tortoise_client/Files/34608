I was under the impression that youngsters in the Netherlands, for example, were less likely to try marijuana.\r\n\r\n[DrugPolicy.org!](http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana/factsmyths/)\r\n\r\n&gt; Myth: Marijuana Policy in the Netherlands is a Failure. Dutch law, which allows marijuana to be bought, sold, and used openly, has resulted in increasing rates of marijuana use, particularly in youth.\r\n\r\n&gt; Fact: The Netherlands' drug policy is the most nonpunitive in Europe. For more than twenty years, Dutch citizens over age eighteen have been permitted to buy and use cannabis (marijuana and hashish) in government-regulated coffee shops. This policy has not resulted in dramatically escalating cannabis use. For most age groups, rates of marijuana use in the Netherlands are similar to those in the United States. However, for young adolescents, rates of marijuana use are lower in the Netherlands than in the United States. The Dutch people overwhelmingly approve of current cannabis policy which seeks to normalize rather than dramatize cannabis use. The Dutch government occasionally revises existing policy, but it remains committed to decriminalization.","controversiality":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166473502,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36656-a2682dc0-2757-4a22-ac62-e019b3d0f89d-1566236772"}

The Cold War provided a justification for open-ended \"defense\" expenditures and the meddling in the politics and economies of weaker nations in the name of \"fighting Communism.\"\r\n\r\nToday \"fighting terrorism\" has become the new rationale for open-ended spending on \"defense\" and for meddling in the politics and economies of weaker nations.  I call it the Lukewarm War: a bit more actual shooting than the Cold War but never so warm as to threaten the interests of those who the Lukewarm War is designed to benefit.\r\n\r\nConsider the U.S.'s notable multi-year failures against two other putative enemies: illegal drugs and illegal immigrants.  Despite noisy, expensive, \"wars\" against them, one can still obtain illegal drugs inside of maximum security prisons or find illegal immigrants living and working in literally every state in the union.\r\n\r\nHow is it, then, that we can't interdict poor, uneducated drug dealers and undocumented workers -- and we can't -- but we're successfully interdicting professionally trained and equipped terrorists willing to die to complete their missions?\r\n\r\nNow consider the climate of \"Cold War Plus\" hyper-secrecy the Bush administration quickly wrapped around its war on terror.  Is that secrecy necessary to fight a putative enemy that has no navy, no air force, and no formal intelligence gathering apparatus?  Or is it necessary to create the illusion of a viable enemy?\r\n\r\nIn the final analysis, if the war on terror cost politically influential corporations money rather than made them money, there'd be no such war.  If the war on terror contravened rather than buttressed \"conservative\" political prejudices, there'd be no such war.","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167417083,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57154-c80cc6a1-ed4e-496c-b03e-71ec241a8d73-1566236779"}

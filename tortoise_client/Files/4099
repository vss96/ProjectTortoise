At the moment, the differences that are obviously genetic involve diseases (Ashkenazi Jews and Tay-Sachs disease, black Africans and sickle-cell anemia, Swedes and hemochromatosis). As time goes on, we may yet come to understand better why, say, Italians are more vivacious than Scots.\r\n\r\nWhy does he write this insightful bit and then ignore it?  Science tells us that ethnicities have distinctive genotypes, but \"races\" do not because they don't, genetically speaking, exist.\r\n\r\nAlso, he fails to account for the way in which we can test for the presence or absence of cultural effects.  Measure the IQs of the group in question on their native soil, in the land they originally hailed from.  Then measure them in the \"immigrant\" land.  What kind of difference do you find between these two groups of people who have the same genotype?","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473807610,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_teev","id":"ctez4","author":"EliGottlieb","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4449-92a4ec22-d8b8-4b4a-b4c3-7fdb2638d985-1566236759"}

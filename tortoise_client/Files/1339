I never said Bret acted illegally but the officers had to find out for sure if he was drunk or not. They found out he wasn't and he was let go. And the the police didn't perform an illegal search they were well within their rights (yes cops have rights too).  Believe I know the diffrence between obnoxious and illegal.  What counts in the end is that the poeple who live in that county are kept safe from drunk drivers.  If you think this kid was right in acting the way he did you have that right.  Please, go out into the world and act like that. I just hope you don't run into someone who is less patient than those officers. Some people don't care if it's illegal to beat the piss out of obnoxious punks.  I hope you never meet one of those people.","score":-6,"ups":-6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167512168,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59031-5494e9d2-9c63-4b7f-b0e2-ab042b727b05-1566236780"}

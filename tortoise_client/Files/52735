(Actually, on my laptop it's e:\\documents, since I keep all my data files on one partition for ease of backup.)  I just got really sick of not being able to find files, or having stupid tools barf at the space in the path, or having files saved under my user account not show up when in Administrator mode.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55787-841df9d2-9096-47a7-a187-98a0e7fcf9a1-1566236779"}

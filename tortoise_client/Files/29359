Previously simple things become hard (or at least sufficiently annoying).  And while Erlang is great for getting the bits from here to there, at each end, I have to work with those bits!\r\n\r\nAre there some Erlang libraries that make general string processing less painful?\r\n\r\nI wish there was a way to glue together Python code with Erlang.  If I could use Erlang for protocols and concurrency, and Python for the general computation, I'd be very happy indeed.\r\n\r\nI wonder what it would take for PyPy to target the Erlang VM?  Would it even be possible?","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16135-6b70f9e6-c4ff-4d01-8091-60dcf5d52b97-1566236763"}

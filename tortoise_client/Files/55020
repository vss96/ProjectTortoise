Not so.  Persons with inoperable pedophilia or some other grievous crime still need to be dealt with regardless of whether we can prove the cause is biological.  \r\n\r\nIn my mind we punish crimes for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1.  To discourage the criminal from committing the crime again.\r\n2.  To discourage others (by example) from committing the crime themselves.\r\n\r\nThese reasons still hold when you state that a person's brain is deterministic.  In fact, they hold even more so because their brains, if informed of the punishment, will deterministically be affected by the punishment.\r\n\r\nSo I assert that not only is the question of free will not answerable (or even well formed) in physical reality, but it also has no bearing on what we do.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40295-9391c580-a5fa-4811-8237-e78f9091924d-1566236773"}

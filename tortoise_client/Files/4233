What he is most likely doing is making sure the kid is not flushing anything down the toilet.  Does that surprise you?  There are plenty of people in the world who are big enough assholes to make their kids hold their drugs for them.\r\n\r\nBut lets face it - that a cop watched him pee is likely to be the least traumatic aspect of the situation for this kid.  His parents may end up in jail - maybe for life.  He could end up in foster care.  There's a lot to be concerned about for that kid, but a cop seeing his weewee is really not high on that list.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uf7k","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":9,"ups":9,"created_utc":1165860018,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22739-1cc47a04-e864-49eb-9b3b-7c0cd663b6f7-1566236766"}

I believe that the local intel the Japanese had available told them that the carriers were already out of port, they still wanted to take out the big guns.  The true strategic mistake, in hindsight, was that a second wave did not take out the tank farms and cripple the US navy's fuel supply.  Without the fuel stored there we would have had drastically diminished fleet and a/c activity for probably a half year or more until the tanks could be rebuilt and more fuel shipped over from california.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165303221,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctnof","id":"ctnvg","author_flair_text":null,"author":"evgen","retrieved_on":1473807777,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8488-c7e4c3be-379f-4ef2-8763-329a8f094fa1-1566236760"}

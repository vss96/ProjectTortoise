Violent crimes happen in every country - including the US itself, you know. \r\n\r\nThe truly amazing fact is that the story is being seriously brought here as a criticism of Israel, and is being highly upmodded as such. \r\n\r\nThe reason there's so many stories like that here and so few on Saudi Arabia is, I believe, not the influence of powerful elements in the US, but because Reddit discussion has been hijacked by hate-mongers, who subscribe to one narrow view of the world, and hold multiple usernames. This is why stories on Iran's government-sponsored Holocaust denial convention never managed to reach the top ranks, while this meaningless story got no less than 143 points.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this is best parody of Reddit I've ever seen. And I'm truly astonished so few commentors seem to realize how ridiculous it is. \r\n\r\nI wonder if the guys over at Wired are seeing the kind of \"Crowd Wisdom\" they payed for.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808931,"gilded":0,"id":"cvdai","parent_id":"t1_cvbj2","edited":false,"author":"lennox125","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38492-721e62f7-94a8-41d3-826e-3fa41325d12c-1566236773"}

How could they possibly know?\r\n\r\nMaybe you should ask them?  I mean, your tax money was used for that report, wasn't it?\r\n\r\n&gt; I'm referring to the Saudis referring to Christians and Jews as apes and pigs.\r\n\r\nStill referring to those phrases, in their textbooks?  I wonder how they explain  [that](http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-06-04-opposing-view_x.htm) away.\r\n\r\n&gt; The fact that the Saudis (and other Arabs) can't manage to do a decent boycott just points at how disorganized and undisciplined they are.\r\n\r\nOr not.  I remember a friend talking about a high-school trip he went on to Jordan in the late 1980s (he lived in rural Idaho, so it was a big thing for him).  Among the things he mentioned was how, at the Dead Sea, the Jordanian security forces would trade with the IDF soldiers: Cokes for Pepsi.\r\n\r\nOf course, they can't make such boycotts work.  No one can.  Whether or not their failure was a systematic fault, or just something people could get away with is a different issue.  To me, it just looks like another case of lip service to the Palestinian cause, for the most part.  The governments pretty much all had some level of diplomatic contacts with Israel all along.  The people, who you'd read about in papers as being anti-Israeli, turned out to be welcoming to Jewish tourists, for the most part.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166096094,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27811-c3c30def-b6a0-487f-9f1d-5ca772beded4-1566236768"}

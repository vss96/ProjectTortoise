There is no ad revenue involved (a website with amazon links!), and Usenet has no charter that allows people to determine what can be posted.\r\nIn response to her campaign to vilifiy the author, she has recruited users on uk.comp.sys.mac to sign up on reddit to discredit his articles, and the uk.comp.sys.mac newsgroup has posted email hate campaigns that call Daniel everything from a child predator to a homosexual, and various other usenet type comments about sex with animals.\r\nOther members of the uk.comp.sys.mac newsgroup have organized to spam the author and attack his website, including posting comments attacking other readers, posted under Dan's name.\r\nZoara is a huge hypocrite on a mindless crusade against a writer who publishes historical and technical stuff for free. What a twisted bitch.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166855637,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cv3py","id":"cvtn8","edited":false,"author":"albk","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809247,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46925-c2efc250-3f6f-4a97-b048-8ba77a43b528-1566236775"}

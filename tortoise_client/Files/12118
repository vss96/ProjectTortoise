{"body":"To be fair, a similar thing happened in Turkey after the liberation from the Greeks - multiple times, as the military (the cult of Ataturk, as I like to call it) stepped in pretty much every time an Islamist government was elected, took over, and then handed power back to a civilian government within a few years.  The Turks are cool like that.\r\n\r\nIslamists, remember, have as a part of their platform the mixing of church and state and the submission of democratic instutions to religious leadership (the Council of Guardians in Iran, for instance)- Islam is both a religion and a form of government to these people.  I suppose it is similar to having a \"ban all guns\" party in the US - the platform is completely incompatible with the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI suspect something similar is happening here - a nascent democratic government that fears a populist revolt.\r\n\r\n(edit: Council of Guardians, Assembly of Experts.

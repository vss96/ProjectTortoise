It's just hard for me to understand how no matter what the church does or says, all the anti-religious zealots refuse to believe that the church can do anything good.\r\n\r\nOh, and Noxx...how exactly would throwing money at Darfur solve any problems there? Check out this page  http://www.nccbuscc.org/comm/cip.shtml and look at all the organizations and charities that the catholic church funds: schools, universities, charities, hospitals, refugee services, housing, disaster aid, etc, etc...\r\n\r\nA lot of people have this assumption that priests and bishops live in luxury from what their parishioners give. Sorry, but many priests take a vow of poverty, and the rest make hardly anything with most of the property they use (house, car, etc...) being in possession of the Church.\r\n\r\nSo please, atheists, stop looking to the Church or Christianity as the bogeyman for the world's ills. You should look elsewhere, like human nature, for starters.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809388,"gilded":0,"id":"cw133","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vzwx","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50634-d3fcc97a-98b8-46d5-bd3a-fe8a62befbf9-1566236778"}

The spline's slope at the endpoints are approximately the slope of the line from that endpoint to one control point (IIRC), and the slope at the center of the spline is the same as the slope of the line between the two control points; this little fact is necessary to 'connect' the spline with the rest of the drawing.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807540,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctb9p","parent_id":"t3_t8li","author_flair_text":null,"author":"almkglor","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2797-b437c8a9-f707-4fa8-a99c-b8441bc2bb2c-1566236759"}

It was created by males with types of questions dealing with things that males are taught to value and encouraged to study. It should be no surprise that they score higher.  Hopefully, in the future we will embrace more of a Howard Gardner sort of approach to intelligence, which includes 8 different types of intelligence and can, obviously, measure far more than the IQ test can.  It is, after all, not a biased test, but a limited test.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t48y","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-3,"ups":-3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164940988,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"346-b7f5ecd7-8be4-4689-a060-b3b23d7b4100-1566236758"}

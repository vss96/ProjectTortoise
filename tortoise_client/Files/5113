In fact, Esser believes that his new role will help make PHP more secure. So, assuming he has good intentions and isn't doing this as some kind of hissy-fit ego-boost, there is now -more- of a reason to use PHP.\r\n\r\nI disagree.  All products have bugs.  However, one crucial indicator for the long term success of a tool is how the developers respond to bugs.  If they blame them on incompetent users, as the PHP developers seem to, then the bugs won't get fixed.  That means PHP will remain inherently insecure.\r\n\r\nI think the likely result is far more security alerts, far fewer security patches, and a whole lot more holes for hackers to get in.  Frankly, after this development, I wouldn't trust any PHP application that's exposed to the Internet.  Darn shame, because programs like Wordpress and MediaWiki really *are* useful, but are you willing to take the risk of compromising your firm's servers?","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uvnj","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166198180,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":17,"ups":17,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30638-ea707fbb-79cd-4c89-802c-802c041d9d31-1566236769"}

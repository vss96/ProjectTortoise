So let us start from first link ( we will assume that Palestinians can know the palestinians casualties a best - ok?)\r\nSo Sep 2000 - May 2004 - 3020 dead. If I know to count it is not thousandS in a year. It is even not a single thousand in a year. It is ~800 dead. It is also counted: suicide bobmers, collaborates killed by Palestinians themself and armed people killed during the battles.\r\n\r\nHere is the Israel statistics. (I'm not taking it from your Palestinian site -because I assume that Israeli's now better about their own casualties): Israeli civilians killed by Palestinians 701, Israeli security force personnel killed by Palestinians 316. ( By the way it is statistics for 6 years of intifada). By the way data is taken from [betselem site!](http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp)  Btselem is especially sympathetic fro Palestinians the human rights watch organization (it will not lie for Israel side)\r\nHere is their description: [As an Israeli human rights organization, B'Tselem acts primarily to change Israeli policy in the Occupied Territories and ensure that its government, which rules the Occupied Territories, protects the human rights of residents there and complies with its obligations under international law!](http://www.btselem.org/English/About_BTselem/Index.asp)\r\n\r\nBy the way in general - casualties ratio is 1:4. \r\n\r\nThe full data:\r\n\r\n29.9.2000-30.11.2006\\t\r\nPalestinians killed by Israeli security forces and civilians\\t4032\r\n\r\nIsraeli civilians killed by Palestinians\\t701\r\n\r\nIsraeli security force personnel killed by Palestinians\\t316\r\n\r\nForeign citizens killed by Palestinians\\t53\r\n\r\nForeign citizens killed by Israeli security forces\\t10\r\n\r\nPalestinians killed by Palestinians\\t215\r\n\r\n&gt; (remember even the Palestinians and lebanese are human beings)\r\n\r\nAnd Israelis? No? \r\n\r\nSo will you say that you was mistaken? No? I thought so...\r\n\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44583-93ffc1ca-9bd9-4ce2-adaf-7eade9cb64a6-1566236774"}

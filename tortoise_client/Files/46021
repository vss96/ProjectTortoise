{"controversiality":0,"body":"I'm increasingly of the opinion that the notion of \"identity\" becomes a bit shaky when comparing across, say, time. As you yourself brought up software, let's then think in terms of an AI.\r\n\r\nRun, pause, copy, run both copies, but in slightly different environments (let them interact with outside world, say... or different virtual worlds) so they start to diverge. Which one of the two would you say has identity with the original? It would seem that they both have equal claim to that. But it would seem also they do not have identity with each other.\r\n\r\nPerhaps then if we wish to be able to speak meaningfully about identity across time, we must abandon the idea of idenity being transitive?\r\n\r\nBut a definition of idenity that's not transitive would seem to begin to make the whole idea of \"identity\" a bit shakier. We could simply use the term \"continuity\" instead, perhaps?","link_id":"t3_veo0","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166655076,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"Psy-Kosh","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvh2q","id":"cvjz8","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809061,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42007-4f47b2f1-bce2-4326-874c-0d4cc3ea7e7f-1566236774"}

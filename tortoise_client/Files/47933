Cyclists have the same rights on the road as do other drivers; hence they should have the same responsibilities and same risks. The fact they chose to cycle, is just like somebody choosing to a drive a car that (to themselves) is more dangerous. I have no trouble with that, in fact I enjoy high horsepower rear wheel drive vehicles (which tend to have the tendency for snap oversteer) and accept the higher risk as coming with the greater freedom I enjoy.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like the penalty for killing a bicyclist be the same as the penalty for killing a pedestrian, then you'd have to agree with bicylists only have as many rights on the road as pedestrians: e.g. being fined for leaving their designated lanes or crossing without a pedestrian light.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you want to share the road (that is the law for bicycles), you have to share the risks. Still, drivers need to be educated on bicyclists (and I try to be as courteous and considerate I could be to them: if one is in front of me, I merely wait for a time I could safely go around and not honk; if I have to cross the bike lane to take a turn, I always check if there's a bicyclist in my blindspot, etc..); but there are risks involved that *everyone* needs to accept. That is the price of living in a free society.","controversiality":0,"ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1165094420,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3814-ec34fed4-386f-4247-b0d5-e77840082086-1566236759"}

There was a guy carrying ''litterature,'' i.e.,  creationist crap -- and eager to distribute it around,  not too me,  as I was laughing so hard at his face,  I wish I hadn't,  just to get a copy as a trophy -- and who wouldn't stop harassing the guide with his fundamentalist nonsense;  something similar also happened at the interpretive center (is it called like that?);  it seemed to be well organized and deliberate efforts -- thinking about it,  you don't need too many people to achieve a pretty good 'coverage' of the various tours on offer...  it would be interesting to hear from rangers to see whether my experience was typical or if I just got ''lucky'' that day though.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56374-6dd76eff-d1d2-4e09-aab9-6315e625ada4-1566236779"}

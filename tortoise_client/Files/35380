Having been through something like this, I really urge parents not to do it.\r\n\r\nAs a child, especially one who wants to please his father, it's very difficult to give informed consent in this kind of situation.\r\n\r\nInstead, supplement your child's education, but allow him to continue interacting with his friends on a day-to-day basis. Find good mentors and get a university-library card. \r\n\r\nIf school work isn't challenging, that's great! Get that crap out of the way, so that the child can pursue real, deep interests. All this applies to girls, too :).\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that we're in love with the idea of prodigies. A lot of adults aren't particularly smart, so when they see a smarter than average kid, they start throwing around words like \"genius\".\r\n\r\nTime spent pursuing deep interests without the pressure to succeed, or to work is extremely valuable. I'm in favour of enriching childhood, but not shortening it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I wish this kid luck. I hope he's happy when he's 30.","controversiality":0,"score":13,"ups":13,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165878254,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuhxg","parent_id":"t3_uhfb","edited":false,"author":"HiggsBoson","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808342,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23487-dc5dbf30-3bb4-4806-bf84-6d23e5c26412-1566236766"}

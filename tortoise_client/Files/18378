Are you teaching that pony to \"please\" you?\r\n\r\n&gt; but allow him to continue interacting with his friends on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nI don't recall reading that he was banned from seeing his friends.\r\n\r\n&gt; Find good mentors and get a university-library card.\r\n\r\nI'm sure he has both.  He does go to a university, after all.\r\n\r\n&gt; A lot of adults aren't particularly smart, so when they see a smarter than average kid, they start throwing around words like \"genius\".\r\n\r\nTrue, but I don't see what the problem is with letting him go to college.  He'd be wasting his time in school all day.  The only trick is, as you mentioned, to make the time to hang out with friends.\r\n\r\n&gt; Anyway, I wish this kid luck. I hope he's happy when he's 30.\r\n\r\nFor every child whose parents put them in college at age 11, there are a million who were merely beaten or molested regularly.  I find it ridiculous that so many people worry about this non-issue.  The problem with school is that the kids are his age but the academics are lacking; at Uni the academic portion is there but the kids aren't his age.  I don't know of institutions set up to deal with this so they have to compromise either way you slice it.\r\n\r\nOf course, if all the young kids who COULD go to college were ALLOWED to, he wouldn't be alone by any means.  They could hang out and read Spider-Man and calculus books.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24113-e95b8ed5-242a-48d7-9a89-fe92d3410b78-1566236767"}

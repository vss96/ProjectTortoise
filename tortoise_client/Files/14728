I just don't see enough in the backstory and setting to hang a game on. \r\n\r\nOkay, they have two factions, like WoW... is anyone going to play a side other than the Browncoats? They'd have to break out the main cast into player classes... engineer, doctor, pilot, courtesan, dumb fighter, hidden ninja type. \r\n\r\nI guess that works. But the appeal of Firefly for me was all in the character development. It could have been filmed as a classic Western series with horses and sagebrush. It didn't really need the spaceship, and that's the weakness of this project. There is no big, fleshed-out sci-fi world to ground it in, like Star Wars, Star Trek, etc. Once you remove those main characters and their stories that were the only appeal of the show, why would you want to play in that world?\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u1x9","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1165549237,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15272-59b17a7b-c454-49fc-847d-8d9156e40710-1566236762"}

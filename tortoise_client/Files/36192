This new hire received no formal training, but was allowed to ask an experienced Haskell programmer questions as issues came up during the self study. After this training period, the new hire was handed the geo-server specification and asked to write a prototype in Haskell. The resulting metrics [156 LOC, 112 lines of documentation, 8 hours development time] are perhaps the most stunning of the lot, suggesting the ease with which Haskell may be learned and effectively utilized. \r\n\r\nGetting up and running fast in a new language and environment is another very important piece of productivity. All the other experimental subjects had a fair amount to high amount of professional expertise in their language.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_twtt","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":23,"ups":23,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165462475,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13088-d1b0cbf8-343e-4aad-8f2c-5a9671a2a432-1566236762"}

I have generally held Amnesty International in high esteem, but this report gives me the impression that they have been influenced by the propaganda war that the Kremlin is fighting especially furiously against the Baltic states these days.\r\n\r\nEstonia is a small country, with ca 30% of the population of foreign origin. Requiring knowledge of native language to gain citizenship is not discrimination, it's a vital necessity to preserve the unique culture and language of Estonia. And as time has shown (and the author of the article points this out as well) setting some requirements for citizenship has most probably been the best option. I believe this has helped decrease the divide between two rather different ethnic groups; young Russians born here really seem to feel at home and part of the society. They attend Estonian universities and have jobs in Estonian workplaces. This is their homeland. Also, you must take into account the feelings of native Estonians - our land was brutally occupied for 50 years and the language and culture was basically set to be made extinct by forced mass migration. This is a very delicate issue for many people and I reckon a good compromise has been found.\r\n\r\nIn response to happyjuggler's comment - actually I believe that the state subsidises language lessons for non-citizens to some extent here. And yes - the US does not allow non-citizens to work for the government either. Wouldn't the opposite case be viewed as radical over there as well?","created_utc":1166494425,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":20,"ups":20,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvarn","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvac1","author_flair_text":null,"author":"frukt","retrieved_on":1473808883,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37351-7349583b-d3b2-48dc-85fd-5872e752bd01-1566236772"}

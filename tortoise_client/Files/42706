Amusingly, using this \"probabalistic avoidance\" will make programming errors of this nature harder to detect.  \r\n\r\nThe real solution to this problem using a managed environment like .NET or Java, or having profiling tools which can detect errors like this in the code itself.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't feel any safer having a tool that makes incorrect code less likely to fail but does not actually fix anything.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w4wp","subreddit":"programming","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1167249312,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"FlyingAvatar","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cw6ik","parent_id":"t3_w4wp","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809491,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53576-d78ef658-22a1-4786-aa24-6a485856d04c-1566236778"}

In Canada we just fired the head of the federal police for the mistake he did about a single Canadian that was handed to US authorities who then decided to send him to get tortured in Syria. It's called accountability and its what a real free democracy who deserve that name should do. I really wish you to fall in the hands \"of a couple low-ranking soldiers with free time and a digital camera\" one of those days.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808066,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu3ce","parent_id":"t1_cu1m3","author":"ArcticCelt","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15662-ba14b944-9b08-42d7-991c-a242e16087e2-1566236763"}

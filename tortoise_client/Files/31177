She has a very beautiful FACE – nice smile. Plus, I like that she wears glasses .. and, lets be honest, she has ample breasts. However, that is like the standard reply to every photo-shopping item posted on reddit. \"oh she looks better without the photo-shopping” “she looks better without the make-up” “there is something about cellulose and wrinkles that turns me on”  “my favorite pass-time is hitting the nursing homes and chatting up the ladies\" maybe you are not lying – I cannot pass judgment, All I know is that people are VAIN!! They worship youth! They buy stuff because hot looking models embody virility and sexual perfection, and subconsciously ignite their archetypal desires which are magically satiated by whatever product is being sold. People are not buying cars, deodorant, beer or shaving cream. They are buying eternal youth, virility, success, fame, fortune. That is the advertising game. And that is the trap. In any case, I have been advocating the need for ugly people to get on TV and into Hollywood. It’s a revolution waiting to happen!","created_utc":1167461451,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":30,"ups":30,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58360-5bcf285a-4b76-4153-89c8-0d191416ad53-1566236780"}

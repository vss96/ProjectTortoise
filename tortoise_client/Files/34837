Gracie Jiujitsu is possibly the best fighting art I've seen if you want to really hurt someone in a one-on-one fight.  In the Real World, though, it just leaves you vulnerable or (if your guys outnumber his) gets you in your friends' way.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the best thing you can do for learning formal martial arts if you want to be able to handle yourself in a \"real fight\" is to learn a little each of Japanese jujutsu, aikido, and something like Krav Maga or Jeet Kune Do (boxing works, too -- especially Thai kick boxing).  Rarely does superior expertise in a single martial art serve as well as competence in several, if there's a serious fight going on.","score":-2,"ups":-2,"created_utc":1166756090,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvpla","parent_id":"t1_cvlho","author":"apotheon","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809169,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44801-e1573301-0190-4dfc-a1a5-c1d007ec092e-1566236774"}

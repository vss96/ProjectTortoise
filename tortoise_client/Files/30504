It is not merely stating something that is false. It is stating something that one *knows* or reasonably believes to be false, with the intention of deceiving the person to whom you are stating it, usually to gain some benefit for yourself.\r\n \r\nThe point is that there is no evidence Paul was *knowingly* propagating something he believed or knew to be false when he stated it. Christianity might be utterly false, but that doesn't make Paul's actions fraudulent.\r\n\r\nWhereas there is plenty of evidence to suggest the Book of Mormon was just plain made up by Joseph Smith. The history purportedly depicted in the book is similar to fictional material well-known at the time, and completely contrary to archaeological evidence; the \"reformed Egyptian\" inscriptions supposedly transcribed from the plates do not bear any resemblance to any language; the supposed translation reproduces elements of the King James Bible, which was likely Smith's source for scripture, even when those elements are based on faulty translations of the Hebrew. These are postive pieces of evidence we have in our possession which discredit Smith's story. Also, his later \"revealed\" doctrines were often self-serving.\r\n\r\nWe don't have similar positive evidence to disprove the Christian doctrines, just skepticism.","controversiality":1,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809168,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cvor3","id":"cvph5","edited":false,"author":"sickofthisshit","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44750-8f779825-e853-4e4e-a807-595a7149b038-1566236774"}

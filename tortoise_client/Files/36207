Do you know why?  I don't care.  I don't care that other Christians have a different interpretation of the religion than me.  It's not affecting me in any way, shape, or form that they try to convert people and take the Bible completely literally.\r\n\r\nWe often have discussions in our Science class at school about evolution, the difference between science and religion, etc, and everyone's OK with that.  I'm not exactly sure where Redditors live that they can claim fundamentalist Christians have \"taken over\" and are \"ruining America\", but from my viewpoint at least, this isn't the case.\r\n\r\nIf their beliefs offend you, then you can speak up.  But I'm not going to do it for you.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v6h2","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808865,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Jimmy","id":"cv9tw","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv931","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36820-da5e818b-d51c-4ac0-953a-7fd5650f2ff0-1566236772"}

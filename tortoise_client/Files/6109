It's like when you head out 30 minutes before rush hour and end up in a traffic jab, but if you head out in rush hour the roads are clear.\r\n\r\nEveryone thinks they can beat traffic by heading out 30 minutes early, and then they think if they keep close to the car ahead they'll get through quicker. However if people drove at 30 in a 40 zone that normally gets clogged up and kept 5 seconds between them instead of 2, well they'd probably find themselves less stressed because they spent less time stopped. It's like getting stuck behind someone doing 40 in a 60 zone.","controversiality":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166548683,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvdl7","parent_id":"t1_cvcz6","edited":false,"author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808937,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38665-a328dc83-424b-463b-bcfc-a26347137c8b-1566236773"}

I believe it was moded down because the poster implied that a number of European states were client nations to the United States and took offense. If you look at recent history however it's obvious that in many ways they were just that during the Cold War and this fact became increasingly evident the further the war escalated.  The Soviet Union was seen as a threat to world peace and as a result other nations were willing to let America dictate their their foreign policy and to a lesser degree even domestic policies like economic regulations. \r\n\r\nIncreasingly (since the fall of the USSR) Europeans are seeing the United States as a potential troublemaker on the global scene.  In part because of the vast Military-Industrial complex that the United States (and the few remaining \"client states\" like the UK) have maintained even after the communist threat was greatly diminished.  The \"war on terror\" was a needed development to justify maintenance and development of new weapons technologies like the one mentioned in the article.","created_utc":1165348110,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9666-4b5710d6-22cd-4dac-8e82-4caa0f43925e-1566236761"}

Your grasp of proper grammar is disturbing.  The only reason I found your site was through a mention on imdb.com.  Yes, I understand that \"entertainment journalists\" use silly words like \"prexy\" and \"pic\" but what bothered me is the general style in which you write.  Your sentence structure is poor and you fail to make transitions nor coherent thoughts.  I re-read your article three times to make sure I wasn't having a nervous breakdown.  I hope you take the time to work at your writing.  If you want to do this professionally, you should dedicate yourself to developing the skills required to succeed.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166577424,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39893-1d35bf87-161b-41e4-92ca-7e190d17872f-1566236773"}

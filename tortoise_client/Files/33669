Any open source library that is in developing state has their API change easily, faster than 6 months probably.\r\n\r\nI can't remember a Python library change that took fewer than six months from deprecation announcement to full on removal. It is fine to get upset when someone criticizes your baby, but don't throw mud when you don't know what you are talking about.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to *know* what you are talking about, a list of all the deprecated modules in the Python standard library can be found [in PEP 4](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0004/), which also conveniently enough defines the deprecation process. Just getting a change to PEP 4 to happen will take a while, much less waiting out two Python releases for the deprecation to happen.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808591,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuux6","edited":false,"id":"cuvc5","author_flair_text":null,"author":"senzei","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29890-7c2a0dbd-c4d7-49f5-b80f-b4b31a4bcb4c-1566236769"}

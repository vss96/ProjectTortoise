I suppose I could go down the list point-by-point and try to correct it, but since no citations were provided, I believe that would be an exercise in futility.\r\n\r\nThe last point is easy to refute, so I'll try that one. The writer says that \"esp[ecially] in Auschwitz... the German guards would flee approximately 2 days in advance of the Soviets.\" No, the Nazis rounded up most of the 60,000 remaining prisoners at Auschwitz and its subcamps at 1 AM on January 18, 1945, beginning a death march and transport west. The Red Army arrived at Auschwitz the afternoon of January 27, finding \"7,000 sick and exhausted prisoners.\" (Czech, Danuta, Auschwitz Chronicle, 1989, pp. 783-5, 805.) The writer adds \"That is why the trail from Auschwitz was only ~2 miles long\" -- no, that is a complete invention. By January 20-22, prisoners who survived the death march were reaching Wodzislaw, 30 miles away, where they were loaded onto rail freight cars to continue their brutal journey to destinations hundreds of miles away like Ravensbrueck, Buchenwald, and Mauthausen (ibid, 794-9).","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36662-74ca4713-c907-4c72-b8fd-7e277b46c0f7-1566236772"}

Netflix was a big expense for us that we never got adequate enjoyment out of.  We'd get a movie, watch it, and then it would be 4-5 days before we got another one.  It's way more cost-effective to use a TiVo, at least for us, and catch up on the tons of good dramas on television right now: Grey's Anatomy, Lost, The Shield, Heroes, The 4400, BSG, Scrubs (?!), and so on without commercials.","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39424-b79fa44e-4c2c-4390-8b3f-71323211fb0a-1566236773"}

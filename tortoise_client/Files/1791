What matters is what percentage of the population are gamers.\"\r\n\r\nThis is doubly true. Everyone's talking about how suddenly their 60 year old grandma is gaming again, thanks to the Wii.\r\n \r\nIn Japan, their 60 year old grandma never _stopped_ gaming. She's always had a handheld GBA or GBA SP. Or a game capable cell phone. And I'm not talking about something pathetic like the Ngage. \r\n\r\nPeople in the US probably won't get it. Halo, despite how much it sucks as a game, will be dear to so many people because it was there when they had their first LAN party. They would bring over the xbox to a friend's house who had a spare TV, and go at it, 4 on 4. \r\n\r\nHard-core gamers (not me) have been doing LAN parties for the past 10-15 years, and it just caught on in America with the release of the Xbox and Halo. \r\n\r\nFirst gen games might not have any problems with load times, but its a little quick to write off the Wii as a no-load time system. Zelda for GC takes something like 4 blocks on my memory card. Splinter Cell: Double Agent, likes 67 blocks, and its load time is much larger. \r\n\r\nAnd having a hard drive for saves instead of having to buy bigger and bigger memory cards is going to factor in the cost of the wii: do you want an upfront cost, or do you want hidden costs in your system?\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w37e","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809503,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"redrobot5050","edited":false,"id":"cw72c","parent_id":"t1_cw5f6","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"53881-5d17fd48-9d88-4dc1-90df-877f8b9e5357-1566236779"}

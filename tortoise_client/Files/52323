Not only is the author juxtoposing traditional romance and sloppy sex, but also the romance is supposed to be male subbiness and is opposed to male toppiness as of course expressed through sort of frenetic vanilla sex.  But it's such a complete worldview usually, so many men and again straight women really think of the world through this kind of lens.  The article isn't saying it here, but so many say it for them, that this kind of Male top woman bottom kink is supposed to be natural, expressive of things like economic differences, all despite it being theoretically expressed mostly through vanilla heterosexual boffing.   For an SM community person it's an extreme world view, kind of like edge play without even the concept of a safe word or a limit to the game.  Fascinating, but a lot of yall life in an weird world.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t9b6","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165006619,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2096-397dc065-251b-4c32-9f52-a6a05a028a2a-1566236758"}

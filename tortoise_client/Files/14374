Chinese people do not care about the environment, much less animals. It's not just about poverty, either. For example...sharks? THey're just tasty fish. \"If the oceans run out of sharks, we'll just to find more expensive, tasty things to eat.\" There is absolutely no social awareness about animal rights or the environment that you find in America. Personally, I trace it to a lack of pet ownership and to the importance of food in our culture (I\"m Chinese).","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v38d","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35185-a0893136-3c24-454e-83ec-124c7e8d8200-1566236771"}

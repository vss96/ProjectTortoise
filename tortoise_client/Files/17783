People pay for most of these things not directly, but indirectly.  Entrepreneurs act as a proxy for consumers, trying to make money by creating what consumers want, and for all the fields you mentioned with the possible exception of space exploration, entrepreneurial capital is the major driving force for research.  And all entrepreneurs do is try to predict what people will be willing to pay for.\r\n\r\nYou are correct in that it's not \"low-level\" choices in that consumers don't walk up to scientists and ask for particular research.  But I would argue that their influence is still very strong even though there is a layer of businessmen in between.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808579,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuuj4","id":"cuupx","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"asokoloski","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29625-2faa55e6-c6a2-4bc3-8df7-fc4d6a99c35a-1566236769"}

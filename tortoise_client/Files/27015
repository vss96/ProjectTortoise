It's called sophistry. Keeping knowledge from people which would save their lives; making them believe they will go to hell if they do not obey... these are not people who have had the opportunities for education you may have had... Making use of un-educated ignorance and mortal fear to put people at a very high risk of a nasty death is what one might defensibly call murder.\r\n\r\n&gt; If God wills something to be, it doesn't matter how horrible you think\r\n&gt; that it is, because if that's what God wills, then that's what should happen.\r\n\r\nAh but there's the funny thing ;-) to turn the analogy around a bit, *why* do Christians look right and left before crossing the road? If they really believe that God's will shall be done, is it not blasphemous to intervene?\r\n\r\nIn fact one would honestly expect all true believers nearing the end of their live to look forward to the next phase; to rejoice in what awaits them... Strangely most don't exhibit that behavior.\r\n\r\nLuckily there are still some true believers who refuse to have their children innoculated against diseases. Because, as you say, Gods will be done.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uz4h","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808716,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv1xw","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv1i4","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32810-5f7e522a-dc2e-4ae5-af8e-a362d095bdb9-1566236770"}

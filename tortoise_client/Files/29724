Basically, it was a big box of lessons of varying difficulty on various math subject aress like (Time 1, Time 2, Time 3), (Geometry 1, Geometry 2, ... Geometry 5) and so on.  There were maybe 18 subjects or so.  You picked one of your choice, took a pretest to decide what level you started at, then did that level, took a test, and then if there were more levels. Rinse, Repeat.\r\n\r\nIt was the coolest thing I'd seen in school.  Alas, I was done with everything in the third week of school (mostly gating on the teacher's time to score the tests).  As far as I know they never did that again...\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ut1n","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808584,"author":"j-o-h-n","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuuyl","parent_id":"t1_cuucm","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29757-4bf82cec-c1dd-4caf-a793-ed0ef2bdc559-1566236769"}

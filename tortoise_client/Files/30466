Two problems, though: cost and grading bias.  First off, grading such long answer questions on a huge scale would be incredible expensive (though very well maybe worth it).  But that also brings up the second point; more tests mean more graders, and more test per grader.  That to me means overworked, less qualified graders, people looking for writ answers more than understanding (especially any sort of different viewpoint understanding).  \r\n\r\nI just worry that no matter how well enginered, these tests will always end up being the baseline and nothing else.  No one is arguing that the current test-prep ness of course doesn't actual have factul information, it's the process and the actual grasping of that information that's lacking.  \r\n\r\nThis of course presupposes that everybody should have a standardized body of knowledge in their education.  That, though, is a seperate topic.\r\n\r\nFinally, what do you do with questions that don't have a simple \"why\" answer?  In my mind, that is many.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166148144,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":11,"ups":11,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29548-e894b0fe-3202-4322-bf0c-f4ff42f79052-1566236769"}

Whenever I see a Boston 2x2 I look for someone who either doesn't understand what's going on - or someone who is trying to hide something through constrained choices.\r\n\r\nFor a start, this little 2x2 ignores totally the impact of group dynamics and culture. We are social animals and react to the expected behaviour of the group. A team that doesn't buy in to the supposed aims and direction of the business is not the same situation as one where there is a shared desire to achieve.\r\n\r\nCoupled with that there is no mention of the type of business or the type of people. Where its easy to draw a connection between personal performance and business performance (eg sales) it's much easier to use money based motivators. In contrast, where good performance is hard to recognise things go wrong when simplistic metrics are employed. That's without mentioning the different motivational needs and expectations of the manager type and the professional type. A programmer is much more likely to be motivated by peer recognition than manager recognition - after all, what does he know?\r\n\r\nThe one area he does get it right is in recognising that the only motivation that works in the long run is motivation from within. But how many businesses are interested in the long run?","retrieved_on":1473808905,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_va3v","id":"cvbwn","author_flair_text":null,"author":"dude78","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37876-13a21096-0cdd-4869-95de-f8a39350a997-1566236772"}

I know from personal experience that cigarette smoke will find its way from one apartment to another no matter how much duct tape you use to try to block off all holes.  I found this out the hard way when I took an apartment that allowed smoking, thinking that if I simply blocked off all the vents and never opened the windows I'd be OK.  I ended up needing to purchase 4 air purifiers just to be able to breathe without issues.\r\n\r\nI've learned my lesson and now pay the premium to live in a non-smoking apartment complex.  It seems sick that I have to pay extra for the priviledge of being able to breathe.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ubmh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":15,"ups":15,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165778641,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20542-447ccc59-714f-4b65-9d6c-2164d0358fdc-1566236765"}

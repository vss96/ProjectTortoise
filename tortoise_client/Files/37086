And you conveniently ignore such facts while being very strict on other things you've said that suit your accusations.\r\n\r\nOf cause it is risky, it is after all surgery, yet you provide false statistics to spice up your claim.\r\n\r\nSad as your brother's story is, it is after all just a single case and a single case doesn't make up a statistic and doesn't prove anything. You could give me the email of tonight's lottery winner and that wouldn't convince me to \"invest\" money in that.","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13452-a32d802a-f9c0-4865-8f1f-32fd47603c33-1566236762"}

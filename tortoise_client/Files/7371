The town center is undergoing a lot of gentrification and thus is improving at a fast rate. On the other hand lots of areas around it are *very* rough unless you travel another 15 miles to get to the suburbs which are OK if that's your sort of thing. Unfortunately the town has a lot of heavy industry within the city's limits which means a lot of people with money choose suburbs without giving it a second thought. I wish there was a bit more thought put into urban planning in Canada... it shouldn't be that people are force to flee cities to make room for smoke stacks. It should be the other way around.\r\n\r\nI also have to say I'm surprised that most Americans assume that Canadian cities are cleaner than American ones. Maybe I only traveled to the good parts of the US but I have to say that the American cities I saw were better kept than the ones I visited in Canada. Then again, most cities in Western Europe are much nicer than anything you'll find in North America.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46067-2fb0f205-cb01-4244-b945-a73ec1a68694-1566236775"}

{"controversiality":1,"body":"&gt; The debate is about the \"run great\" property you claim Java, Ruby, and Python all have. Do they compile to efficient native machine code, for example? Do they smoothly link to \"native\" binary libraries?\r\n\r\n&gt; Or do Pythonistas need to drop into C every time they need real throughput? Or do Java people need to build JIT compilers?\r\n\r\nWhat about Haskell and OCaml? They produce good native machine code *and* it is very easy to drop down into C if need be for libraries or other reasons.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tksn","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1165270738,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctm6m","parent_id":"t1_ctlfh","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807746,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7664-0a7f878a-05ee-4c0e-9187-2c8c755f69d2-1566236760"}

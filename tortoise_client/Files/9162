You can take it from me.  I have used both an ipod and a creative mp3 and bar the patented 'wheel' the creative device was FAR easier to use.  iTunes is the most rediculously convoluted mess that I have ever had the misfortune to have to 'break' in order to use and the ipod menus themselves are not as easily navigable as the creative ones.  \r\n\r\nAs for macs,  the only reason you think theyre easier to use is because you obviously have no idea how to use a pc.\r\n\r\nThe mac will never outsell pc for one simple fact,  sexy is great,  ease of use is great,  but configurability,  upgradability and scalability will always win out in business.  A lot of 'opinions' come from individuals like you, but business is what drives the pc/windows market.  You can make excuses about how MS always undermines or buys out other companies who create original things but the fact is, MS create and improve plenty of their own software and the mac crowd are feeling insecure about the last island of competition they think they own in the OS market - sex appeal.","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23237-508b8b14-200f-4146-87e6-cbf24754bfba-1566236766"}

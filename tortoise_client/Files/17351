Most of the time you can leave things like the background and color properties alone and they get inherited from their parent element.  In other cases, you can use selector grouping to set the styles of multiple elements at once.  Between the two, I rarely end up repeating colour definitions more than a couple of times, even for complex layouts.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53043-95ca85b8-7596-495d-82d3-28090d75d78d-1566236778"}

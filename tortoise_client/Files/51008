(WTF?) This example of his misleading writeup of a story is no better. \r\n\r\nTwo issues missed in the \"research\" is that iTunes sales are not going down at all, but are on the rise:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.blackfriarsinc.com/blog/2006/12/do-math-itunes-sales-arent-collapsing.html\r\n\r\n... and that on top of that, a significant chunk of iTunes Store sales comes from gift cards, paypal, and the \"iTunes Allowance\" gift certificates because kids don't have credit cards. This study only looks at credit card sales, and only the buying habits of 7000 people, less than half of whom bought any iTunes music on their credit cards. \r\n\r\nAnd to anyone bleating about vendor lockin: can you push a button on your Xbox and dump out your Xbox games on a CD that will then play on PlayStations? Can you do anything similar on the DS, allowing your games to work on a PSP? Can you dump out Windows Office in a form that works on Linux or Mac? No, in all cases you have to buy a new version or go without. That problem does not affect the iPod and the minority of music iPod users have bought from iTunes. It can all be poped out on a CD and used anywhere.\r\n\r\nSo stop the insanity. If the iTS doens't work for you, keep buying your CDs. Don't preach your screed full of misinformation and FUD.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26744-a67c8165-df97-451e-8c4a-952ba1c95004-1566236767"}

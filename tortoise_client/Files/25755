To go back to your first point, one thing I think should be pointed out is the socialism does not necessarily equal command economy.  Don't exclude the middle; the world is a complicated place.\r\n\r\nThat said, the internet isn't a good example.  Wasn't it originally a government invention?  Hasn't a lot of what actually maks it special been done by people working for fun or in their spare time, not for money?  I don't mean to imply that capitalism hasn't helped the internet grow, it has in certain ways, but that certainly wasn't all.\r\n\r\nI do think that simply equating \"profit\" with \"good\" is a very dangerous idea.  Profit _can_ be good; free markets can very much make the world a better place.  Markets run amok can also make it much worse.  As I said, the world is a complicated place; everything has unforseen consquences.  Such is life.  You insult the \"slogans\" of others, call their ideas \"illogic\", yet it seems much of what you are saying is nothing but sloganeering on the opposite side.","ups":4,"score":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166585009,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvg5e","parent_id":"t1_cvfpl","author":"foxyvixen","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808986,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40104-66c30e57-574e-41f1-a125-55581aa635b9-1566236773"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Anything embarrassing in Bush's past, he simply refuses to talk about -- like being a coke-head. He tries (for the most part, successfully) to prevent photos of the coffins of service men and women killed in Iraq. Now this. He thinks if he doesn't talk about it, nobody will know it happened.\r\n\r\nJust when I think Bush's abuses are as bad as they can be, something like this comes along. I can only hope that this country learns enough to never make this kind of mistake again.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uyx6","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166222330,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"DA5lD","id":"cuyzu","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uyx6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808661,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31566-43a4d84e-4f50-4981-965c-2382790756b0-1566236770"}

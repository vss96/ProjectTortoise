The only flaws that I can think of are that certain cliques on Digg have carved out these niches for themselves (Apple users, fans of Nintendo's Wii, bloggers obsessed with \"Web 2.0\").\r\n\r\nThe part about Reddit that bothers me the most is that, unlike on Digg, the number of cliques here is much much smaller. As a result, a very large portion of Reddit's front page will be dominated by far-left political opinions (Iraq, anti-government/police/army posts, anti-Israel posts). There are other dominating themes on Reddit, of course, as most of you are probably aware yourselves.\r\n\r\nHowever, as for Reddit's superiority, here's what it basically boils down to: I click on almost all links that make it to the reddit front page. I click on very few links that make it to the Digg front page. The reason is very simple: There are far fewer stories on reddit, which means the links no one wants to read are weeded out a lot more efficiently. On Digg, all sorts of lame things pop up among the top stories, simply because there are so many users that SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE found that a particular piece of crap link was interesting enough to \"digg\".\r\n\r\nI'd just like to make one more point, though: everybody here seems to focus more on commenting than on story quality, so let me weigh in. On Digg, all sorts of garbage gets posted in the comments because there are so many users, as you have all pointed on. On Reddit, however, most of the comments are extremely homogenized. It's not that people here have a group-think mentality, it's that the site attracted a certain very specific portion of the Internet: tech-savvy, politically active far-left liberals. For someone who's a political moderate (like myself) or someone who's a conservative, this is one of the most hostile commenting boards on the internet and the reason why I may come to Reddit for some cool stories, I generally avoid commenting here as much as possible, or even reading the comments, since any participation I attempt, no matter how well-thought-out, would quite clearly be down-modded and attacked by a mob.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14010-88190377-1c76-49cd-baf7-b27411874e5e-1566236762"}

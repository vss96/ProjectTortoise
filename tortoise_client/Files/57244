Let's just say Nintendo makes a $50 profit on each Wii sold (they probably don't, although the 1UP.com podcast said that Wii's cost $88 to manufacture; dunno how true that is). So Nintendo is making this large profit at launch, but what if they decided to just break even at launch? They wouldn't be making any money, but they wouldn't be losing it either. Most importantly, that is $50 more of tech they can put into each Wii. 6 months down the line Nintendo would then be making a profit on each Wii sold, however, its console would also compare more favorably to the PS3 and 360 a few years from now.\r\n\r\nNintendo may make a profit now and be selling consoles out the ears, but when devs really start to grasp the PS3 and 360, the Wii won't even be in the same league. And at that point with the 360 being perhaps $200, are people going to go for the graphics, AI, physics, or will they go for the gameplay and the unique controller? It is hard to say, but Nintendo certainly wouldn't have hurt itself by putting a bit more inside the box.\r\n\r\nI still think it is inexcusable for the Wii to at least not be better than last-gen hardware. Developers like Bungie were limited as far back as 2 years ago by the Xbox's hardware when making Halo 2, and now devs will have to make that kind of power work for another 4-5 years.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165114178,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4338-ffcbf41c-bacd-439d-b48f-cade820bbf44-1566236759"}

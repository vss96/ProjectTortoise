The incidents would be so infrequent, and torture is so ineffective, and giving state agents the authority to torture makes them see EVERY scenario as a ticking-bomb scenario to which torture will DEFINITELY find a solution.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean the hypothetical will never materialize... it seems quite feasible to me.\r\n\r\nThe moral tension lies in the fact that in that hypothetical, which could definitely happen, we'd be crazy to prohibit torture if we were sure it would save hundreds of thousands of lives.  Wouldn't we consider that to be wrong, to be egregiously inconsiderate of human life?\r\n\r\nThat doesn't commit us to blind utilitarianism, it just means we seriously value life.  \r\n\r\nSo, we have reasons to establish a rule discouraging torture, while there are particular instances in which we'd want to violate that rule.  If we don't violate the rule, we act wrongly.  If we do, we profane the rule established as right.  To what is your allegiance, thousands of lives, or the sanctity of a rule?

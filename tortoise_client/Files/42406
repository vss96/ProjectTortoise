Ridiculous!*\r\n\r\nNobody holds a gun to their head and forces them to accept a loan. So long as the paycheck loan companies say \"this is our rate of interest, this is the period of time over which that rate will be applied, this is how much you will owe at the end of that period,\" the borrower has only himself to blame if he overextends himself.\r\n\r\nAlso notice that nobody in any article or discussion I've ever seen applauds paycheck loan companies for helping people out of a jam (after all, not everybody ends up in a downward spiral like the people described in this article). If it were truly the case that \"both are responsible,\" then the paycheck loan companies get credit for helping people out, too - you can't have it both ways just because you like your heroes humble and your payday loan companies evil.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't think they get credit for helping people out - I think they offer these loans purely out of self-interest, and the people taking these loans take them purely out of self-interest. Therefore I think neither one of them get credit for being noble nor blame for being evil. Even the saintly credit union profiled in the article (\"saintly\" meaning \"charges only a moderately absurd rate of interest for paycheck loans\") isn't noble - sure they offer better rates and financial planning classes to help the customers get on their feet, but why? Because they are good people, or because there is now a HUGE market niche for paycheck loans at competitive interest rates? And it's great for consumers - anyone who wants one of these loans now benefits and can get one at 15% thanks to the competition.\r\n\r\nAnd at what point does an interest rate become \"ridiculous\"? 520% annual is ridiculous? What about 400%? 200%? the 25% rate many credit cards offer? Why not let the consumer decide? Surely they would much rather choose for themselves what is and is not an acceptable interest rate. In fact, I imagine that if you went back in time and tried to stop one of the people profiled in this article from taking out a loan, saying \"no don't do it! The interest rate is RIDICULOUS!\", they'd probably tell you to fuck off and mind your own business. \r\n\r\nThe best you can do is give people the information and the resources to make a well-informed decision; after that, the ball is in their court.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809270,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvuso","id":"cvuu2","author":"anusmccolon","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47457-f1546dee-5b9e-405f-97fb-d8adc28cfb13-1566236775"}

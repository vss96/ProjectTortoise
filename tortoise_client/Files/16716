I'm fully ok with Microsoft just letting the software manage their own dependencies. Windows is considered a bloated OS enough as it is.\r\n\r\nThat said, if they decided to come out with dependency management, i'd be all for it. i'm just not going to count it against them that they don't, especially since now they'd have to find some genius way of making it backwards-compatible.

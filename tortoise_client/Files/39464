And the male has a point, unless he’s playing a D/s game he didn’t sign over complete control of his sexuality to someone else.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't care if my male watches/looks at the stuff because I'm reasonably confident that if I can't compete with his fantasies it was never meant to be. My view is that if he’s actually chasing other people, that’s a relationship breaker (including dirty chats with other people) but otherwise the most negative input I’ll give is snarky critique of the particular artistic merits of the image(s) or the observation that she is soooo obviously faking.","link_id":"t3_ucli","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165788211,"ups":11,"score":11,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20867-aa18cc7d-43f0-4e3b-905d-edfa38952c78-1566236765"}

What a rip off!\r\n\r\nNo, I know there are huge chunks of information that I (I'm the author) glossed over or dealt with like a smartass. That's deliberate. The idea was to present a basic getting started guide to parents with cameras who are too intimidated by the software to do anything beyond cropping. There are plenty of advanced tutorials out there explaining the ins and outs of proofing and curves and so forth... and that's great. This is more about getting comfortable using layers to tweak different areas of a single image in different ways for better results. No harm in making fun of how insanely intimidating the whole mess can seem when you're just starting out.\r\n\r\n(Besides, I didn't say a professional WHAT.

I don't even have US Dollars to begin with. This is all for the sake of debate.\r\n\r\nHowever, that's precisely my point. There has never been a perfect storm up until now. OPEC hiked their prices back in the 70's but the consumption power of the US overcame that. The Japanese were out to get you in the 80's, but their economy crashed and the US soared (for entirely different reasons).\r\nBut now, not only are the waves looking like they could hit hard, the American boat isn't all that stable either. \r\n\r\nYou need faith to maintain the belief that self-correction will always bring the US back to the top. If self-correction were to have any factual bases, then by its nature, self-correction brings the markets to what they deserve, not what they want. Also, could the Feds really go for higher interest rates when the housing market looks as they are?","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166381307,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34204-ece74b45-ec60-445b-8b00-c632f37c3f4f-1566236771"}

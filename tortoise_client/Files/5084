So for example, if we look at 2 most recent plot points for songs:\r\n\r\nJul-05 - 500 mil. sold\r\n\r\nFeb-06 - 1,000 mil. sold\r\n\r\nSep-06 - 1,500 mil. sold\r\n\r\nWe can see that the amount sold in 7 months between Jul-05 and Feb-06 is about same as the amount sold between Feb-06 and Sep-06, at 500 million songs.\r\n\r\nYou will also notice the same trend for iPod sales - the average amount of iPods sold per month has remained same, if not slighlty decreased over the past few months.\r\n\r\nSo forgive me if I don't see any \"dramatic\" increase in sales, in fact, it looks more like the sales have indeed \"flatlined\", as the original article, that this author berated, has correctly stated.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808467,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_uo4l","edited":false,"id":"cuoo7","author_flair_text":null,"author":"lemekim","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26702-87fd0515-06e3-4963-abb0-1f0aef418d14-1566236767"}

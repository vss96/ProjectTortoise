My family consists mainly of petty professionals and otherwise educated people. After college, I spent a (longish) period of time pretty much completely destitute. But, at no point did I ever consider myself \"poor\" or otherwise than a \"middle class educated person\". I mean, even making zero dollars a year, living on savings, and then working at next-to-nothing an hour, living in a hovel, etc, etc, I never once did anything completely stupid like _taking a loan at 520 percent interest_. Or _having three kids out of wedlock_. Or _robbing a liquor store_. Or any of the other hundreds of things characteristic of the lower class.\r\n\r\nA combination of state of mind (_viz_, \"I am better than that\") and half a gram of common sense is all that it takes to _not_ be an economic wreck. I'm not so impressed by appeals to \"protected circumstances\".","created_utc":1166910584,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47785-4a399c07-a5b4-4ca2-957b-6a06ad9c111e-1566236775"}

It cost an adult 8p from suburbs to town. So today's money maybe 25p (48 cents) ? It worked great. To live without a car was no problem.\r\nHowever, some rich people decided they'd rather have slightly lower taxes and instead spend the money on extra petrol burned by their V6 Jaguar sitting in a traffic jam. They'd rather keep more of their money, while being more stressed out and wasting time taking ages to drive home.\r\nSo Thatcher \"rate-capped\" the council (i.e forced local taxes lower) so there were no longer funds for cheap regular buses. Then it got privatised and run by ruthless monopolistic companies that just care about extracting a fast buck from a drastically reduced service.\r\nI like George Monbiot's idea, but this won't happen as long as there are people too myopic to see that we need to get money from somewhere to pay for this and infrastructure is worth paying taxes for even if the benefits are only indirectly felt by the wealthy.\r\nCar ownership really brings out the worst in people. There are many people far too selfish to even consider travelling on public transport, shock horror having to sit next to someone else. Or wait patiently while an old person takes some time to get off the bus.\r\nIts very depressing to read such a clear simple solution and be so certain it will never happen because people are so staggeringly selfish, and unable to comprehend that compromising their own  desires for the sake of some \"common good\" might actually come back to them as good karma.

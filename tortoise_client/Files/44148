Take the time to at least *walk past* a poli-econ class or even a history of anything since 1800.  Yes, the article is blatantly nationalistic but it's never xenophobic.  The Swedes have a culture that they're proud of.  Being a very homogeneous society with a cohesive cultural trajectory that dates to the early middle ages, Sweden has every reason to fear the injection of a populace with no regard for their way of life.  \r\n\r\nThe argument that you offer above is woefully American-centric (so you'll pardon me if I assume that you -like myself- are an American).  The US is, after all, a nation that is (ostensibly, at least) predicated on immigration and open culture.  Sweden isn't.  Neither is Denmark, nor Belgium, nor France.  These are nations that have a cohesive national identity that they don't want destroyed by an influx of people whose ideology is fundamentally unsuited to \"Westernity.\"\r\n\r\nYour idea that Muslims exhibit religious tolerance is curious.  Where, exactly, do they exhibit it?  Certainly not in countries run by a Muslim majority.  Can you imagine the bloodshed that would ensue were a million Swedes to decamp to, say, Syria?  You also assert that \"anyone interested in living in a theocracy would not emigrate out of one.\"  Are you sure about that?  Perhaps they merely want to take advantage of the access to capital that Europe affords them, without actively attempting to assimilate.  Very often, they refuse to learn the native language and adopt the articles of fundamentalism as a symbol of their disdain for the nation that has taken them in and preserved them from whatever wretchedly depressed locale they arrive from.  \r\n\r\nI wonder if you weren't so hopelessly American and were part of a culture you could value if you wouldn't feel a little different.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Grammar","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809712,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cwi7z","edited":false,"id":"cwiai","author":"OttoVonBismarkk","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59477-324cfd78-82d1-4620-b3fb-c9d24163d99a-1566236780"}

Sometimes that patron-state to client-state relationship is coercive like the old Warsaw pact, or China's relationship with Vietnam, and sometimes it isn't like the USA's relationship with the other NATO countries.  We need to accept this fact of history not dream of impossible utopias where its not true.  Once we accept it, the existence of advanced weapons like this pain-gun are revealed as a good thing: it gives military and police personnel options that need not kill.  Would you seriously rather see rioters shot dead in the street than harmlessly made to flee?  \r\n\r\nWith regards to the cost issue, the article says this thing only cost 40 million over 10 years!  For crying out loud bringing a new drug to market takes just as long and costs hundreds of millions of dollars[2].  Like a new medicine, an effective non-lethal weapon is a device that could save thousands of lives.  People who would otherwise be shot and killed.  So at 40 million dollars this is a STEAL!  We could only wish the rest of the government was this efficient.\r\n\r\n[1]  This may change in the future.  France and England both have significant Military-Industrial complexes (although much smaller than the USA's) and now through the mechanism of the EU, we should begin to see them displacing American protection to some degree.  \r\n\r\n[2] http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/38/15/25\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tocn","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9537-54268f3b-bf00-4365-93b3-e8c05a1bb218-1566236761"}

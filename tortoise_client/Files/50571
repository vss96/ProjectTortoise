{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u03j","stickied":false,"body":"&gt; One probable reason that the Internet has evolved so quickly is because changes can happen very quickly. This adds a layer of red tape.\r\n\r\nI don't think there will be any significant red tape. Net neutrality legislation would just disallow content-discriminating behavior on the ISP-side. This is basically how the net already works.\r\n\r\n&gt; Current Internet service is essentially non-tiered (at least at my level of purchasing). I actually want to be able to buy tiered service, where I can buy some high-priority bandwidth (use the ToS or precedence flags to indicate this).\r\n\r\nThis is actually unrelated to net neutrality. Net neutrality is about not making *producers* pay more for tiering. The consumers already have tiered bandwidth/rates for their connections, but that 1GB/day (or whatever) cap applies equally for all content that you get (more on this in that PDF).\r\n\r\n&gt; It's easier to add regulation than to remove it. Larry Lessig has identified a potential problem, and he's pointing out that it's easier to add regulation earlier than later. I'd rather wait and see if the problem actually shows up.\r\n\r\nI see your point, but net neutrality is already around. The corporations are the ones that are actively trying to remove it (as opposed to net neutrality advocates suddenly wanting some random regulation). If they're going to fight, then it's best to get the first blow in.\r\n\r\n&gt; However, on the whole, I think that legislation isn't the first thing to throw at the problem.\r\n\r\nI agree. However, the ISPs are the ones trying to legislate here. Net neutrality advocates are fine with the status quo.\r\n\r\nEssentially, I think you are arguing from the standpoint against big government and unnecessary regulation. I agree with that for the most part, but there is a need for regulation when the companies are overstepping and trying to turn the internet into the equivalent of TV commercial-space.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165625968,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cu6tw","parent_id":"t1_cu381","edited":false,"author":"shimei","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808133,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17498-780d2097-2319-4cdb-8255-be8c732f7ec5-1566236763"}

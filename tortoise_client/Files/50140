As near as I recall, however, \"Silkies\" were super-humans from the far future that had evolved (or mutated to) the capability of travelling directly in space.\r\n\r\nAs far as travelling without benefit or protection of spaceships goes, again Van Vogt was the first to write of such in his story entitled \"The Cataaaaaa\", written in 1947.  This story deals with a cat-like lifeform that possesses the ability to teleport about the galaxy directly, by means of mental manipulation of universal energy fields.\r\n\r\nFor additional reference, here is the Wikipedia entry:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._E._van_Vogt\r\n\r\nPlus, this link as well:\r\n\r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20040513074305/www.oivas.com/van/van2.html\r\n\r\nwherein is found this particularly interesting observation:\r\n\r\n\"**Empire of the Atom** fix-up (1956) Should precede **The Wizard of Linn.** Unusually coherent stuff by van Vogtian standards, based on material published ten years previously. Dark and atmospheric palace intrigue on a decadent future Earth, set after atomic wars: Mutant Emperors, beautiful but cruel Empresses, scientific priestcraft, failing technologies and barbarian swordplay. At the time accused of being derivative of Robert Graves' Claudius books, this was actually quite influential. Frank Herbert's **Dune** is only one of its most obvious descendents.\"","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_taej","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807777,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctnuj","parent_id":"t1_ctkcb","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8478-da57c969-02ba-4a79-8143-4110489e93ae-1566236760"}

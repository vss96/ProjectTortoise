{"body":"this sounds like an incredible opportunity - I would love to see what an OSS run community would do with a gameworld like Ryzom. Also, the ability to have coders throughout the world contributing ideas and innovations sounds like there could be some really creative interactions set up in this game.\r\n\r\nMy only concern would be how would you run such a beast it it were to go open source and everyone could hop on? The network and server hosting costs would be astronomical.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just pledged some money - hopefully we can see this happen.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v0jw","subreddit":"programming","ups":12,"score":12,"created_utc":1166293119,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"rks404","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv1hm","parent_id":"t3_v0jw","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808708,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32585-8c966cf9-1b6e-4eb1-ba50-761509fd9cc3-1566236770"}

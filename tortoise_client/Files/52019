That's pretty much right, buet here are a few more details.\r\n\r\nAll the distribtuion centers within a state start with the same first ddigit, and are usually consecutive (but now always).\r\n\r\nThe alphabeticization within a center isn't perfect and isn't a 'documented feature'. Some post offices are satelites of nearby, larger (or formerly larger) post offices and have zips adjacesnt to their parents'. Some towns have changed their name and are now mis-sorted. And some are newer than the zip system, and so get whatever number (wthin the distribution center's allocation) that was available.\r\n\r\nIt's amazing how much arcane junk I learned as an observant and curious policital campaigner in the 1970s and '80s.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh, yes, distribtion-center areas never cross state boundaries.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807848,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctqwk","id":"ctrmm","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"BarkingIguana","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10236-d0b91896-5184-4c0c-ba35-96320f68b13f-1566236761"}

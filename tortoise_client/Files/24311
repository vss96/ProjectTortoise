{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vtf3","body":"I agree with yout to a degree. But AllofMP3.com succeeds also because they don't bear the costs of the product. All they do is take something someone else has produced, refuse to pay royalties, and resell it at a markup to their costs. If you eliminate costs by stealing, it's easy to make money. \r\n\r\nA legal retailer that had to pay licensing costs could not charge the prices that AoMP3.com does. And those licensing costs in turn underwrite the cost of discovering bands, promoting bands, producing CD, distributing CDs, etc. \r\n\r\nThe interesting point (and here is where I think we agree) is that this whole model that the labels have built presumes a top-down, broadcast oriented system where you succeed by getting airplay and driving bodies into stores to buy physical artifacts. That world is disappearing and new ways of discovering, promoting and delivering music should appear. But let's not confuse theft with a business model - when people copy music, all they are doing is refusing to pay for something, not taking a brave ethical stand.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166918552,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvvrk","parent_id":"t1_cvvog","edited":false,"author":"corwin","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809287,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"47921-a180aa62-2499-4c6d-891f-5e746a04ec02-1566236777"}

That's why I didn't make that assertion. It would as be as ridiculous as for you to claim that...what, exactly, your proposed single cause for the Middle East being in a bad state? Islam? Climate? Something in Arab genetics?\r\n\r\nThere is a middle ground between 'Islam bad' and 'Islam good' that I sincerely recommend.\r\n\r\n&gt; And states like India are less screwed up now, despite the colonialism.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what 'states like India' are, since there really aren't any. Unless you mean 'states that aren't in the Middle East'. I'd be interested to hear you explain how the states of the Middle East are the most screwed up post-colonial nations in the world.\r\n\r\nIn any case, in India, the redrawing of the borders caused a million-plus deaths, four wars and a standoff between two nuclear-armed powers, one of them an unstable military dictatorship. It would be frivolous of you to pretend that the wholesale nation-engineering in the Middle East, and the insertion of Israel, hasn't caused huge difficulties (just as it would be frivolous of me to pretend that extremist theology and the lingering fall of the Ottoman Empire have no part at all in it).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tdgp","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165311776,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8606-d47dd845-6f51-4f72-b0b1-635065b07568-1566236760"}

What's cool in your late teens and early twenties is just pathetic in your thirties, or, god forbid, in your forties. I purposefully trimmed such people from my life a long time ago.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I have a very active social live. We're regularly having friends over for dinner, taking day-trips or vacations with other couples, accepting invitations for all sorts of things from friends, and the like. We also have our own separate interests; I'll sometimes meet a friend for dinner without her, and she'll occasionally do the same. The idea the interests must match 100% is a recipe for misery. If she wants to stay home and read while I spend an afternoon at the rifle range, that's perfectly okay.\r\n\r\nThese kind of things do require being proactive; you're not going to become a person other folks want to have around by watching \"Seinfeld\" re-runs.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164979143,"score":14,"ups":14,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_t6m2","edited":false,"id":"ct7y6","author":"Stubb","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473807479,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1073-59b4a446-10a4-49de-b94e-6f2cd4fd6b7d-1566236758"}

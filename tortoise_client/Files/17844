The human body doesn't just \"go to sleep\" when the brain ceases function.  I'm thinking of post-mortem farts, etc, as the corpse settles into a continuously \"deader\" state.  Usually takes a few hours, as does a transcontinental flight.  All of this would combine to make 1st class a bit uncomfortable.  \r\nToo funny, when you think of the irony- wealthier travelers flying 1st class to avoid the discomfort of sitting so near poorer folks.  Then they have to share their space with a dead one.  \r\nI've always wondered what \"they\" do when this happens.","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9616-253b2f9d-9e86-460c-bce0-d44e77860697-1566236761"}

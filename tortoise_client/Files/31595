Also, even when I'm in agreement with the guy--on the subject of software patents, say--his hyper-pedantic rhetorical style alienates more people than it wins over. In short, RMS's annoying attributes are those he shares with most other counter-culture activist zealots.\r\n\r\nThat said, his flaws in no way nullify or diminish his practical contributions. I am very grateful for all of those.\r\n\r\nI like Linus because of his practical contributions and because his priorities are straight. His remarkable ability to cut through political and ideological bullshit is a great boon to the Linux project.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28177-11c91371-451a-4bb1-9cd4-39e0366158ae-1566236768"}

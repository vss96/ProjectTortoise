{"controversiality":0,"body":"I'm surprised that no one has actually touched upon the fact that sexual activity is not unheard of among 12-14 yr olds. I remember in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students wishing they could be so lucky as to hang with the group that was known for doing that kind of stuff. I also remember a particular girl's 13th birthday party being more of a make-out fest while her parents holed themselves up in some other room for the night. Preventing this could be as easy as increased, &lt;i&gt;relevant&lt;/i&gt; (i.e - not abstinence) education. But legislation is laughable seeing as how those involved are hardly aware, if they even care, that there are laws like this.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u021","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":16,"ups":16,"created_utc":1165521699,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"manofredearth","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu0w3","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u021","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808021,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14432-a4222012-0f5b-4a79-a080-555c2d216579-1566236762"}

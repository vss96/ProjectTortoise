My question goes deeper than that.\r\n\r\nRemember the early days of jet flight? Everyone said we would never break the sound barrier...until someone did. I am not a scientist and I don't really care about how it will be done. But Hawking's comment that we should be able to power up to 'almost the speed of light' just doesn't gel. Speed is speed, and if we can travel that fast, there is absolutely no reason we can't travel faster than the speed of light. Speed and light are two totally different physical effects. I will probably never see it, but one day man will travel beyond the light.\r\n\r\nAnd when we do, we will colonize the universe. We have no choice. We can't stay on our single planet and survive.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t2bj","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"255-e25e70dc-ce7b-4f54-86f9-0c41a0421e4c-1566236758"}

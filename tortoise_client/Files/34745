His most interesting compositions often came around closing time at the Blarneystone, when alcohol got the better of him. He'd launch on some crazy idea for a song and just improvise for a few minutes. Sometimes it was good. Other times -- I remember once when he became obsessed with a single chord, and started singing about how he could make a song with just that one chord. I don't think that one's going to top the charts anytime soon; but Steve on a bad night is better than most performers on their best night.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807684,"gilded":0,"id":"ctitn","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctfx9","author_flair_text":null,"author":"gcanyon","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6121-6cd536b0-82aa-404f-ae64-b6e0fe886bbd-1566236760"}

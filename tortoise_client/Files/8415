In this latest post we find ourselves sliding down a \"slippery-slope\". What's slipping? And which slope is it slipping down? I have no idea. I am starting to think you are a less than honest broker here. In the last comment I asked you to restate the \"principle\" you are defending here, because it doesn't sound like there's really any principle at all. \r\n\r\nBut all that aside here's the law.\r\n\r\n[On 10/18/2006 the District Court issued a preliminary injunction for the Washington Post against the Department of Homeland Security which includes the Secret Service.](http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/opinions/2006/2006-CR-1737~8:50:38~10-23-2006-b.pdf)\r\n\r\n&gt;it is ORDERED that the defendant provide the plaintiff with a declaration and document\r\nindex, as required by [Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)](http://www.citizen.org/litigation/free_info/foic_lr/foiacases/articles.cfm?ID=6405), indicating the\r\ndefendant’s justification for withholding any documents or portions thereof responsive to the plaintiff’s FOIA request within 10 days of this opinion.\r\n\r\nYou will note the Vaughn v. Rosen ruling of 1973 is the standard legal way for the release of such information, and that this allows the vice-president to request exemptions for anything within the visitor logs with explanation of why this is necessary. Which renders your initial argument completely moot, since he can exclude any secret visits involving \"negotiations with Iranians\" that he wishes too if he was involved in such things. A savvy person would also note that the VP and every other government official in the executive are well aware of Vaughn v. Rosen and its procedures, and that the VP is intentionally flouting this law. \r\n\r\nNow why does the DC circuit court feel that the Post should be granted the extraordinary finding of a preliminary injunction, which actually means they get what they want before the legal question of whether they should get what they want is decided? [Well, this is spelled out by the DC courts Memorandum of opinion of 10/19/2006 which accompanies the above order.](http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/opinions/2006/2006-CR-1737~8:50:38~10-23-2006-a.pdf)\r\n\r\nWe can walk through the 4 reasons required for the granting of a preliminary injunction and why the court found them applicable in detail later if you want. I will assume at this point you'd like to read the details of the above yourself. But the bottom line is that the judge feels it **extremely likely** that the merits of the case are going to be found accurate and that the remedy requested has a strong and timely component to it. In other words the VP's attempt to hold back the logs was just dead wrong.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_uuhf","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809168,"distinguished":null,"author":"smacfarl","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvk3e","edited":false,"id":"cvphj","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44753-5d5044a0-7680-4b90-8341-409250848424-1566236774"}

{"body":"&gt; It is odd, when you think about it, that we accuse racists of \"discrimination.\" This is the very thing of which they are by definition incapable: They think all members of certain groups are the same.\r\n\r\nThere is a sense in which this is true and so we can allow Chritopher Hitchens this literary turn. However, I'd offer it useful to draw the relevant bunch of concepts like this:\r\n\r\n1 Racism. A generalisation about a race.\r\n\r\n2 Discrimination (common usage, alleged to be disapperaing): Discerning difference.\r\n\r\n3 Discrimination (as a short for \"An act of unjust discrimination peformed against people\"): Thwarting a person's freedom or opportunity on the basis of an irrelevant factor. The irrelevant factor is membership of some group (race, gender, disability, age, etc).\r\n\r\nUnder this definition the first two are thoughts, and are therefore never immoral, the last is always immoral.\r\n\r\nWe ought, and do, ban discrimination against people. We ought never ban words to do so. That would be violation of free speech.\r\n\r\nEdit: numbered list","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tnpi","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165323429,"author":"johnbentley","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctoop","parent_id":"t3_tnpi","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807792,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8783-a49f28a1-94f0-4018-9234-b14a03f43695-1566236760"}

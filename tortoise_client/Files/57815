Talk about sensationalist exaggeration. A sponsored link to themselves is a breach of trust? Seems more like ‘going deeper into portal territory’ to me.\r\n\r\nIt’s not clear even the latter accusation is true. Are google’s tips new? I think I’ve seen them for a while now. I haven’t noticed the amount of space devoted to non-search results increase in at least a couple of years. Since they’ve had sponsored results for ages, talking about mothers unable to distinguish ads from content is just rhetoric.\r\n\r\n*You* can distinguish sponsored links from search results, and your mother doesn’t dwell on how google is a hugely moral institution (I think I *will* call you naive). So in what scenario is trust being violated?\r\n\r\n[Cc](http://www.blakeross.com/2006/12/25/google-tips/#comment-94088)","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w1jg","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809401,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"akkartik","id":"cw1st","parent_id":"t3_w1jg","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50971-b75906f6-e213-4cbc-b313-6a387d7bba61-1566236778"}

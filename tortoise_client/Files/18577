You can't tell if you're being bullshitted by an ambitious underling, you can't assess risks. If your only job is scheduling when the cleaner comes, and when people get paid (if that's your view of management) then yes, competence in your field is unnecessary. If your job includes making tough decisions with limited information, then you *should damn well know **at least** the basics*. \r\n\r\nThe decisions are people's lives, not what color to decorate the company headquarters. This is incompetence like Brownie's, like Rumsfeld's. \"Managing\" skill, which is too vague to have to much meaning, is not enough, and this fallacy causes problems time and again.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807889,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cttts","parent_id":"t1_ctrgb","author_flair_text":null,"author":"jbstjohn","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11329-6d5d3e99-94e7-4593-b1f9-b65f4aa243cf-1566236761"}

But it's important to note that we're talking about replacing oil consumption (20mbpd in the US), not just a 25% increase in *current* coal production.  Ie, we'd have to, in addition to what is being currently extracted, extract the equivalent of 25mbpd of oil *more* of coal than we do now.  I'm not sure that is reasonable (and yes, I've not mentioned the horrible other problems doing that would cause because it is a separate issue from peak oil).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tyxw","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808091,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cu4p1","parent_id":"t1_cu1kl","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16222-c2114889-d425-49a6-81f2-9d54f2ad5d73-1566236763"}

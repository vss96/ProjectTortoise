If you wan't a free implementation, I'd recommend sbcl.\r\n\r\n* Multiple dispatch.\r\n\r\n* \"Real\" keyword parameters, where you can specify default values and markers if a keyword parameter was given or not. For bigger projects, this makes a difference.\r\n\r\n* Better meta-programming. The Ruby interpreter takes raw strings as input, a Lisp compiler S-expressions. If you do meta-programming in Ruby, you often end up building up a string and then `eval`'ing it, which is hacky compared to Lisp's macros.\r\n\r\n* A better programming environment that enables you to program in an iterative style, i.e. write a function, compile it, test it in the REPL without permanently restarting or recompiling the whole program. Although if you want a free one, the only option is Emacs + Slime. Of course any editor would suffice, but you lose some of Lisp's advantages.","link_id":"t3_w6m0","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"53760-d609bfbd-0f81-4185-9a59-2631caf45826-1566236779"}

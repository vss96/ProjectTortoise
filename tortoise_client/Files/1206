You can take the points in this article and push them a little to do that: \r\n\r\nShould we torture suspected terrorism suspects? Absolutely. And if they don't confess, let's just say right now that they can be tortured to death... no problem with that... go right ahead! \r\n\r\nBut why stop there? Why don't we just torture whomever the government might suspect in any way. If they have knowledge of a plot, we'll get that knowledge! \r\n\r\nAnd when we torture somebody, let's torture the wives and children too- that'll be sure to make them talk. Results in death? No problem. It's all to protect ourselves!\r\n\r\nOh, one more thing: let's be sure to state this as the completely unambiguous policy of our government. That way, we'll be completely clear on it. And, of course, any other government or other entity that gets hold of one of our soldiers or citizens will know that's our policy, and any inhibition they have against using torture themselves will be removed. In fact, publicizing our new \"enlightened\" position will encourage it!\r\n\r\nWe'll be torturing. And they'll be torturing our soldiers and citizens. We'll be torturing women and children. So will they. Sounds great, doesn't it? I'm all for it!","retrieved_on":1473808886,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v9pw","id":"cvauw","author_flair_text":null,"author":"rayhoffman","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37379-81abb04a-75e4-41c7-91ac-f3a04e0a816d-1566236772"}

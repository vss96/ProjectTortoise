The only reason I see to defend them is if you're a tailgater and then you're driving illegally, dangerously and you're going to get yourself killed and I won't have one iota of sympathy because it'll make the roads safer for me.\r\n\r\nShe did something that's stupid, but if she'd ended up in a situation where she had to slam on the brakes for a good reason someone *would* have died because some moron couldn't drive at a safe distance. It's all well and good blaming her for the crash, but if the second was driving safely they'd have been safe no matter how many times she slammed on the brakes.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_va8f","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166522685,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37943-0a7d5a58-8b90-474d-83c3-95e5cc4cc675-1566236772"}

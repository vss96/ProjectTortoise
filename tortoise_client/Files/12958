Java use isn't a sin and hell yeah Java is \"useful\" in most senses of the term.\r\n\r\nThe question is, why does there exist a subculture of people that hate it, which happens to contain as a subset the programming.reddit.com subculture? I can't speak for everybody here, just myself, but that's why I don't like Java and have long since ceased to care about anything that comes out of that community.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not a nutcase about it or anything. I don't not use Java-based software or anything like that. I just refuse to spend my valuable time on planet Earth working in it myself. I'm _know_ there are some Java programmers who feel the same way about the languages I do choose to spend my time in. Who's right? Depends entirely on how you look at it and what your priorities are.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808567,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cuu17","parent_id":"t1_cutz3","author_flair_text":null,"author":"jerf","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29238-5b1a133b-f4f2-445f-b43b-f298250dc48e-1566236769"}

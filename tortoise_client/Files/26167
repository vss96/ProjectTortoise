The statue was supposed to be a representation of mankind. Afterwards it became apparant the astronauts had turned the statue into a monument for fallen astronauts and kosmonauts. NASA had not told the gallery owner or the artist that the statue was going to be a grave monument! Van Hoeydonck's gallery owner had planned a multiple of 1000 copies of the statue (he had spent a considerable amount of money getting the project realized), but after the public outcry only 20 copies where made, most of which went to musea.\r\n","link_id":"t3_tu3u","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165435671,"score":19,"ups":19,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12230-274192ef-0b43-437b-b85c-b954b3ec40ed-1566236761"}

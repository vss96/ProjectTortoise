{"body":"Popular speech doesn't need to be protected because the masses support it and believe it so it can't be hurt. It's unpopular speech that is offensive by simply being unpopular. \r\n\r\nThe christians didn't like it when they were told the [earth] orbits the [sun] and there's no great crystal spheres holding objects in the sky. If there was laws back then protecting against offensive speech then it wouldn't have been found out for centuries.\r\n\r\nProof of god would be offensive to some and disproof of god would be offensive to others, and proving theory number 3 would offend both of them. Heck, I'm probably offending someone merely by pointing this out.\r\n\r\nedit: Thanks carraway","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_vqg5","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166800968,"ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","id":"cvr03","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvqhy","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809196,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45442-840c3c12-60de-4f0b-a156-8a13da90ebb4-1566236775"}

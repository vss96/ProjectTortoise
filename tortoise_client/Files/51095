{"controversiality":0,"body":"For anyone who doesn't know 1 joule is 1 watt-second. So for example, to heat 1 litre of water from room temperature (25C) would take (75 kcals) 313,800 joules. This isn't a large amount, one unit of electricity is 1 kilowatt-hour or 3.6 megajoules.\r\n\r\nSaying that isn't much, but I can easily boil 10 litres of water in a day just for cups of tea. So in a 100% efficient system, I'm using nearly 1 kilowatt-hour on something I wouldn't even consider.\r\n\r\nFilling the bathtub with water at 37C (99F) would take about 7 megajoules, near 2 kilowatt-hours in a perfect system. This doesn't involve heat leaking from the storage tank, heating inefficiencies and everything else involved. Basically for anyone in the UK (and anyone else, if it applies) never use the immersion heater if you can avoid it. Is 2 kilowatt-hours worth sitting in the tub for 30 minutes?\r\n\r\nHowever for all those pro-shower people we had 10 or so years ago saying you'll save energy by taking a shower, that isn't so true. A low-flow shower (about 10 litres/min, high is about 22.5+ litres/min) if ran for 15 minutes will waste more energy, if you're in for the average of 7.5 then it's good. If you're in for 15 minutes, it would be well invested to take another 15 minutes just to relax and be more eco-friendly. Plus that's another 15 minutes you can have the TV/PC shut off saving power.\r\n\r\nIt may only be pennies, but some people shower daily. 30 days and you're soon into bucks, and if you're mistakenly on a high-flow shower you could be throwing a buck away every shower you take. Now saving $15 a month for taking less time in the shower, or only going for one on even days might be worth it to some people... especially the students that read Reddit.","link_id":"t3_wa1x","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167360983,"score":6,"ups":6,"author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_wa1x","id":"cwbia","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809585,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56128-1e498886-8e29-4938-b428-73f2b9244a9f-1566236779"}

{"body":"The way I read it, OpenID provides an identification. That's all. For all you know, twenty people have the password for that ID, or it might even live on a server that simply says \"Yes\" to every ID request. (I'm sure some people will set those up.)\r\n\r\nWhat OpenID gives us is simply and solely an identification that we can talk about, and impute to some source. _From there_ we can build on other things. A blog that already allows anonymous posting may not care about anything more. (For instance, if I implement OpenID on my site that's how it will work.)\r\n\r\nIf you care about more, you can layer more on top. You may decide you only trust the Verisign-vouched OpenID vendors through some other mechanism that indicates such OpenID vendors. You may decide to whitelist certain vendors, blacklist certain vendors, etc. But you can't do this without something like an OpenID layer to build on.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vpc5","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166839781,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jerf","edited":false,"id":"cvt4h","parent_id":"t1_cvpoi","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809237,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46674-ccb36c6f-a53b-49e4-a331-5bfc6309c66b-1566236775"}

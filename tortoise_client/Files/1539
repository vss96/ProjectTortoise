However the same Bible that says \"thou shalt not kill\" also says \"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\". This promotes the taking of a life based on entirely unsubstantiated superstition. The same Bible that promotes a culture of love and goodwill towards mankind openly discriminates against homosexuals, women and the mentally ill.\r\n\r\nThat's why I consider Christianity dangerous. Not because no good can come of it, but because a lot of what is bad comes from it.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165831688,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21958-6af5189a-8493-482d-a650-abca4dc0f1c2-1566236766"}

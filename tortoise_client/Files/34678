{"body":"It's not. Americans are also humans (except Rumsferatu and Dick 'Bloodfeast' Cheney), so they were definitely included in my comment. Besides, Mr Death is largely about execution in the US, but also about people who believe the strangest shit - like denying the holocaust in the case of Mr Death. It's a very good film, and really stirs up alot of emotion and cause for reflection on various aspects of humanity.\r\n\r\nMy comment was about how, putting morality of death penalty and the act itself aside, truly bizarre and unseen the culture of executioners is. Isolated, having totally different perspectives from the \"normal\" world, and very fascinating.\r\n\r\nSuperficially, it seems similar the psychology of serial killers.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t9px","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165022962,"ups":4,"score":4,"author":"dln","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctatx","id":"ctawx","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807534,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2611-2d7b0d07-ecb2-444c-b185-f81e781ae969-1566236759"}

That seems to no longer be the case, due to pressure from insurance companies.  If those assertions are correct, that illustrates the problem pretty clearly.\r\n\r\nTwo points about \"everyone's cost\":\r\n\r\n1. I'm fairly sure that the overall costs to the economy of over 40,000 premature deaths a year, far exceed the costs of an extra EKG and a day of observation for 3 million more people annually.  The *costs to the insurance companies* would rise, yes.  But on balance, for most of us, it would be an economic benefit.\r\n\r\n2. I've seen plenty of strong evidence that costs would be lower under a nationalized single-payer or universal-payer health care system than under what we have now.  I've never seen any but the sketchiest evidence that costs would rise.  It is possible they would, but it seems far-fetched to simply assert that is so as if it's a simple fact.  Most probably, a national single-payer system would save humungous amounts of money and boost our economy tremendously (by removing the most troublesome and unpredictable cost of hiring, the biggest source of labor disputes, and the biggest headache unrelated to their business, from corporations' plates).","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165274442,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7817-8284e8fe-97e2-4d3b-a49d-77fee34188eb-1566236760"}

All of these big changes can only mean that their lives in front of the keyboard are going to suck once again. They're going to sit down in front of the new Office, not have a clue what's going on, and feel like complete idiots because they have to call on me to help them figure out how to do some random thing. Not that I'll know, but at least they can lessen the suffering by sharing it.\r\n\r\nSo far MS has been the best agent for pushing those friends and family away. IE 7 has switched most of them to Firefox. Windows Media (a few versions back) pushed all of them to iTunes. Some recent version of Windows Messenger pushed several of them to Gaim. A couple of them have switched operating systems, and are happily taking care of business on OS X. \r\n\r\nSo ... yeah. Keep up the good work, Microsoft!","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vgvk","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809136,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"brianwisti","id":"cvnsp","parent_id":"t1_cvhw5","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43830-318d139c-a393-4b3f-ad12-00207cc2771e-1566236774"}

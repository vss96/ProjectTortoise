{"body":"They were looking for a purse. The naked girl didn't have a #$@^&amp; purse up her ass. Any further action via proxy defies all reasoning regardless of whether one's local laws allow this type of proxy authority in the first place.\r\n\r\nIf we accepted that it all of our actions are the fault of being \"just human\" then we'd all be dead. There comes a point when society needs to protect itself.\r\n\r\n[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_negligence) is an interesting measure of where this exact point is:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; This relationship has been formalised by the law and economics school as such: an act is in breach of the duty of care if:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;    B &lt; PL\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; where B is the cost (burden) of taking precautions, and P is the probability of loss (L). L is the gravity of loss. The product of P x L must be a greater amount than B to create a duty of due care for the defendant.\r\n\r\nHis own words show that he had assumed a [duty of care](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligent#Duty_of_care) by taking on this task. He was not forced to do it - several other people had walked out and faced no repercussions.\r\n\r\nSome fool edited the bottom of that link to elicit the superior of \"compilations of jury instructions\".. but if anyone knows where examples of those could be found then it would be interesting to evaluate them in this context.\r\n\r\nOr not, since it's pretty clear that this Nix guy was a f*k-up.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tdn1","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165110559,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":12,"ups":12,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"ctege","parent_id":"t1_cteaw","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807602,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4221-7e225141-1ceb-44a3-95ba-e4dcf935c779-1566236759"}

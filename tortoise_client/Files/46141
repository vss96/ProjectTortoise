The author repeats Greenpeace's \"Thorium reactors are untested\" talking point just two paragraphs after *describing efforts to build a test reactor*.  Presenting both sides of the story is a worthy goal, but not if it means passing on (without comment) an argument logically equivalent to \"We at Greenpeace oppose a Thorium test-reactor because Thorium reactors are untested.\"\r\n\r\n2. The author marches out the old FUD about weapons proliferation, the high costs of widespread deployment, and the risk of meltdowns -- neglecting to mention that France has been getting [about 80%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France) of its power from weapons-grade Plutonium* without incident for the last three decades or so.\r\n\r\n3. The article does point out that Thorium's [not new](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/309/5738/1174),  but doesn't give you an idea of the full extent \r\n\r\n&gt; In **1958**, India announced that it was embarking on an ambitious, three-stage plan to exploit its thorium reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n[*] This is a slight simplification for rhetorical effect.

In your audio he's saying how HE pronounces it. He doesn't speak to the issue of how Linux *should* be pronounced by others.\r\n\r\nIn the latter video, however, he clearly states that people can mess his name up all they want, but that \"Linux is always Linux.\" \r\n\r\nSurely you can see the difference. One speaks to how Linux \"should\" be pronounced (the latter), and the other is just some trivia about how Linus pronounces it (the former).\r\n\r\nThanks for going oldschool on us, though. You totally showed us n00bs.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11029-ba21c7f1-9196-45cb-a05c-1c0611ac3ab7-1566236761"}

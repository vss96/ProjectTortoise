It doesn't seem like this could effect anyone's illegal downloading in any way. The MPAA affiliated bit-torrent downloading does in no way coincide with other bit-torrent downloads. There is no central server hosting anything so if anything, we will just get a better more efficient version of bit-torrent. It's a win win situation for everyone. We get a better bit-torrent, bit-torrent gets money, and the MPAA gets screwed because they obviously don't know how bit-torrent works in the first place. So everyone wins.","ups":0,"score":0,"created_utc":1165542552,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15072-1307fcf0-7eee-478b-b2fa-b7dda0e2af77-1566236762"}

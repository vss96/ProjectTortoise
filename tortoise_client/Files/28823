The writer might actually be that clueless and unprofessional, but I doubt it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he's right about the moonbase being a boondoggle. With current technology, it will be too precarious and limited to be useful for much more than bragging rights for NASA (who'll ensure no one but their gang and token stakeholders ever sets foot there: no space tourism embarrassments this time.) About all it would prove is that we can build a new ISS, farther away.\r\n\r\nWhat are the odds of a moonbase being built? I personally doubt that the US has the ability even to return to the moon for a visit. It's not a question of technology, but of the will to focus that much time and money on anything beyond bread and circuses. We did it once, but that was a very different world: I suspect that the 1960's will be seen (someday) as the peak of western civilization. It's been all downhill from there in every way that matters, with the decline approaching free fall since the mid 90's. I can foresee no development, technological or otherwise, that could return our current society to viability.\r\n\r\nSo... very little hope for another manned moon trip by the west, less chance of a permanent base, and none at all, ever, of a manned Mars mission. China may manage some of it, but we're too far gone (and I'm not confident China will survive what's going to happen soon in the US and Europe.) \r\n\r\nPity, it would have been cool.","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uhgq","subreddit":"science","ups":-1,"score":-1,"created_utc":1165889819,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23851-bcb9dfbe-91b8-4f0e-8adc-ce29d359cae5-1566236767"}

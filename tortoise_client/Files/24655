{"body":"Hmmm - good catch, but I still think [Strawman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawman) fits better in this case.\r\n\r\nNovusTiro wasn't packaging two policies, he set up a separate example and attacked that one.\r\n\r\nThe example for a Strawman Wikipedia gives is:\r\n\r\n&gt; Person A: I don't think children should run into the busy streets.\r\n\r\n&gt;Person B: I think that it would be foolish to lock up children all day with no fresh air.\r\n\r\nNow let's apply this to the conversation between Jamal and Novus:\r\n\r\n&gt;Jamal: I always felt that if governments were sincere about wanting a healthy populace then they ought to tax junk food and subsidise organic and fresh foods.\r\n\r\n&gt;Norvus: I couldn't agree more. It's the government's job to protect us from ourselves. That's why I lobbied to introduce a local tax on running with scissors.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a perfect fit for a Strawman.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, do you think this could also be considered a Red Herring?","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tol1","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165331819,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"altheahouse","parent_id":"t1_ctp66","id":"ctp99","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807803,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9004-26b8c5af-ac5f-437f-8cdd-e4cbdaa31c82-1566236760"}

We're not talking about things that work. We're talking about understanding. I've been involved in the arts for a long time. Main-stream stuff doesn't \"work\" for me anymore. I've grown out of it, which isn't something that happens with medicine that \"works\". I need something that challenges what I know and understand. Something that allows me to question and reassess. Something \"works\" for a while and it doesn't necessarily get boring, but it loses its freshness and that diminishes its appeal. So, I want artwork that challenges the norms. Introduces new facets and, dare I say, elevates things to higher planes (read Husserl). Does that mean that I have to just shut-up and take what's offered because those people who aren't interested enough in art to actually engage with emerging ideas, won't understand it? That's absurd. Art, as all fields dealing with evolving theories and ideas, must continuously move forward and, like with everything else, it takes a bit of effort to keep up. You obviously haven't been keeping up and we're not going to stop the train just because you got your boots stuck in a bit of 15th century mud.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23243-4a494c14-9a9a-4e53-9d47-3b5446cd62ab-1566236766"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"A few counter-examples come to mind; most notably they took a strong stance in favor of gay marriage, even slamming the civil union compromise. \"We'll give you the same rights as marriage, but call you 'butt buddies'\"\r\n\r\nThe Jesus character is kind of an absurd satire of Christianity; I seriously wouldn't use his presence as part of an argument that they're right wing. And I can't remember any time that they've really gone after a sitting politicians. Bush and Clinton both had occasional brief appearances, but neither were really attacked. They tend to focus more on activists.\r\n\r\nIn general you're right though, I consider them right wing more often than not.\r\n\r\nPolitically - they hate Hollywood liberals, blasting them and their issues more than anything else. They're pro free speech. They hate the religious right. They don't like the neocons, but they're fond of reminding everyone that Saddam Hussein was a bad guy. They're conservatives, but of the old school kind... the kind that wouldn't find much of a home in the modern Republican party.\r\n\r\nAnd curiously, what I've observed is that the show will tend to lambast the liberal point of view, but the \"lesson learned\" at the end of the episode (usually delivered by Stan) is always one of moderation.\r\n\r\nSpeaking as a liberal, the only thing they went after that really irked me is Global Warming, which they attacked not once, but twice (maybe three times). The first in the Katrina/Day After Tomorrow spoof. The second with Al Gore calling it \"Man Bear Pig\". The third (arguably) when they went after Hybrid cars (or at least their owners).","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tpok","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165420837,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"ejp1082","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctuit","parent_id":"t1_ctqg1","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807903,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11633-53dce66d-09f6-4179-a605-7b7ddfec71ef-1566236761"}

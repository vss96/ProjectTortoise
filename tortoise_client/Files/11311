I therefore agree wholeheartedly that Pharisee-ism, hypocrisy, pride, etc are very large problems in the church.  However, I cannot go so far as to declare that, across the board, every single Christian is simply earning points for a sky-god.  There are some who are genuinely concerned.  I know a few.\r\n\r\nIn fact, when I was a child (maybe 12 years old), I _did_ have what you described as the \"urgent immediacy\" and \"overwhelming concern\" for those who were unsaved.  Unfortunately, it alienated me from most of the people I was concerned for.  So, rather than pointing at sky-god appeasement or pride as sole causes for the lack of \"this is like a suicide\" concern, you may want to consider the fact that such concern simply doesn't work.  It turns people off in a hurry, way faster than a soup kitchen will.  The choice may be a pragmatic one, in some cases.\r\n\r\nedit - clarification","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tbyh","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807568,"distinguished":null,"author":"bhagany","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctcr8","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctcq6","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3394-87f1e622-b0de-4c93-8542-a195bc81b5dd-1566236759"}

I ask because I don't pay for shitty movies at the cinema -- having seen parts of a movie makes that decision easy. However, I'm willing to pay for good movies or TV series: I've bought Babylon 5 - Season 1, and will buy more of it -- even might buy the movies.\r\n\r\nBack to incentives -- if were talking about open source software, I can scratch one of my itches and release some utility. But this doesn't work for movies. What's the incentive to create another Babylon 5, for example, if the producer can't artificially restrict the supply of said TV series?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vtf3","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"49949-d53788ee-57f9-413e-9521-b034e5db7564-1566236778"}

My guess here (and it's just a guess) is that vegetarians eat more vegetables than the average person.\r\n\r\nAll studies about intelligence should avoid declarations about the average.\r\n\r\nThe standard deviation of IQ is about 15 points.

They are the makers.\r\n\r\nFolks who are very dumb make a disproportionately large burden on society, though crime and poverty.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying all poor people are dumb, I'm saying it's more likely that you're poor if you're dumb.

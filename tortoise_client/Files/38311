To me, it boils down to how often (counting its appearances in the code) you need to know if Process failed. If often, it should throw instead of forcing you to inspect it all the time.\r\n\r\nOTOH, from maintenance perspective, you want Process to throw as it's easier to use later (no need to check the error at each new call).\r\n\r\nOT2OH, from performance perspective (rare case), you may want to eliminate exception-related overhead. Then you need to rewrite everything in the area to be exception-free, including Process. Hmmm... this, in fact, is irrelevant! (What languages except C++ support turning exceptions off?)\r\n\r\nWhile we are at it, I have examples of BIG problems where one can't throw:\r\n\r\n1. logging routines - you are logging an error and logging itself fails - what do you do!? (Dunno, die or do nothing)\r\n\r\n2. resource deallocation problems with C++/Java-like languages: can't clean up the resource, what do you do !?

Essentially, he is referring to the fabrication of a LEGEND to JUSTIFY the creation of the nation of Israel. He doesn't actually deny the massacre, simply questions it - “IF” being the key word in the quotes / translations below:\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom wikipedia:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_and_Israel\r\n\r\n\r\n\"According to the Iran's official news agency:\r\n\r\nIf the Europeans are telling the truth in their claim that they have killed six million Jews in the Holocaust during the World War II - which seems they are right in their claim because they insist on it and arrest and imprison those who oppose it, why should the Palestinian nation pay for the crime. Why have they come to the very heart of the Islamic world and are committing crimes against the dear Palestine using their bombs, rockets, missiles and sanctions. [...] The same European countries have imposed the illegally-established Zionist regime on the oppressed nation of Palestine. If you have committed the crimes so give a piece of your land somewhere in Europe or America and Canada or Alaska to them to set up their own state there. Then the Iranian nation will have no objections, will stage no rallies on the Qods Day and will support your decision.[45]\r\n\r\nAccording to United States media:\r\n\r\nThey have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God, religions and the prophets. The West has given more significance to the myth of the genocide of the Jews, even more significant than God, religion, and the prophets, (it) deals very severely with those who deny this myth but does not do anything to those who deny God, religion, and the prophet. If you have burned the Jews, why don't you give a piece of Europe, the United States, Canada or Alaska to Israel? Our question is, if you have committed this huge crime, why should the innocent nation of Palestine pay for this crime? [46]\"\r\n\r\na fair question, no? say someone takes over your country - how would you feel, especially if your country did nothing to the occupying people?\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v1y6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808797,"author":"lenny247","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv65c","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv5ed","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35045-bd264e06-6ad4-448f-bdcf-757c4bde460e-1566236771"}

When VC cash appears, it likely comes with VC big talkers and chest puffers (who really have about zilch in the way of technical skills).  That happened to one of my previous employers - when I left to go to college, they replaced me with a $150k/year \"release engineer\" that the VC brought in, who really didn't do...anything.\r\n\r\nAlso, there's likely an effect where (in the words of Jamie Zawinski) a company \"stops hiring people who want to make a company successful and starts hiring people who want to work for a successful company.\"  I wouldn't know; that'd be my cue to leave.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, things get much uglier when the cash *disappears*.  But that's another story.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w4pi","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167314801,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54849-96cb2dde-f9ee-433b-891c-c815ca5492b6-1566236779"}

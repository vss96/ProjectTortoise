{"controversiality":0,"body":"One of the reasons (reason, one of my favorite words) I love it here on reddit. All the athiests I know are peaceful, tolerant generous people. We tend to be pretty argumentative, but put that down to the higher level of education maybe.\r\n\r\nalso, I take offense at the assumption that i'm a 'hateful liberal'. I'm not, on the whole, a hateful person. I love my wife and friends, I particularly love this planet and I don't want to see it fucked over by two deluded religions going to war with modern weaponry. That's the only reason I'm coming out anti-religion at the moment. You fuckers (christians and muslims) are threatening the existence of our planet. The only thing I'm not tolerant of is intolerance.\r\n\r\nAs for liberal, you say that as if it's a curse word. maybe it means something differen to you americans. I don't use the word to describe myself - I'm a pacifist first and foremost. Oddly enough, most of the hate speech I ever hear comes packaged as part of either a religious agenda or a racist one.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ubo5","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165837790,"author":"Reg_Spyder","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cuew3","edited":false,"id":"cuf7p","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808289,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22061-deb35d28-f85d-4698-8a4c-f4459148a9df-1566236766"}

They're set\r\n\r\n* All are extremely satisfied with their current position, no need to break out of it\r\n\r\nWow, if I had all of those then I'd be finding some hot chicks and a fast car to come home and play with instead of spending all night wrecking my well-being to get a startup off the ground.\r\n\r\nIn a compelling startup, it seems to me, every day you feel that some competitor is inches from crushing you and forcing you to go back to your old miserable, meaningless life. Google is too good of a fall-back.\r\n\r\nIf I were at google then I'd certainly be creating the world-changing programs that I always wanted to. Creating an actual business?

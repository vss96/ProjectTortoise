I've never been asked about JN when I served on a jury which has been several times.\r\n\r\nI have been asked if I can render a verdict in accordance with the law and I can say \"yes\" since JN is a legitimate right of the jury.\r\n\r\nIf I am told I am only to consider the facts, then I have to acknowledge to myself that the judge is as wrong as if he had said \"the defendent is black therefore you must convict\".  The judge being wrong/ignorant is not my problem.\r\n\r\nIf I were asked directly about JN then I would have to consider that without JN the entire system collapses and the next step is armed revolution so which is worse: perjury or violence?  I favor perjury.\r\n\r\nThe big problem is not enough people know about JN at all.","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1166137563,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cutdd","id":"cutvj","author_flair_text":null,"author":"keylime","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808564,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29164-873a3828-dae2-47ed-abb6-c1ca258cd5f9-1566236769"}

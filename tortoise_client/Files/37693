Too bad I didn't realise the (time.com) in the end, which meant that this was the same crap that I read in print last week.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the most disappointing articles I've ever read. Time doesn't actually make any concrete suggestions. They just use the \"How could schools improve?\" premise to do a boondoggle on two or three unusual schools out there. Then they glue this together by vaguely identifying some of the problems in schools in this country today.\r\n\r\nNo actual solutions. No particularly interesting analysis. Just your standard Time crap. How can you honestly label it as \"A Realistic Plan To Improve Schools\"? It's no plan at all!\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_whie","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809708,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"cwi3m","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_whie","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59358-55f26163-a5db-49d6-bf15-cacf12973686-1566236780"}

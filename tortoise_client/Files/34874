Most of the OT was merely societies recording themselves. As a scribe, you worked for a patron, a local chief or minor monarch, and you wrote about the splendour of their greatness - otherwise you lost your livelihood and perhaps your life.\r\n\r\nIf we took shakespeare's writings as a model for a religion we'd certainly be in for creating some interesting social practice. \r\n\r\nAncient literature is a primary source to the understand of ancient culture. It reflects their belief systems at the time they were wriiten. Trying to make these contemporary to me is a futile exercise as the social preconditions that gave rise to these works are gone... long gone..\r\n\r\nBTW - upmodded you for putting a calm counter argument even though we hold opposing views..\r\n\r\nHappy Solstice.. :)","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1167000284,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49077-59160fc2-3cdf-4dc1-ba7f-8b0f031f8872-1566236777"}

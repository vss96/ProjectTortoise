I mean really, how was SBCL to know that 95% of the world's computers don't run on UNIX?\r\n\r\nAnd it gets worse. This lowely Windows programmer thinks he is too good for a \"unsupported, half-complete port\". So what if any 1.0 libraries written on Linux have a good chance of not working on Win32?\r\n\r\nI bet you he is going to start complaining about DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME not working on dates before 1970. I bet he didn't even bother reading the release notes that say it is only the timezone data that is unreliable. \r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"49-228a5cc8-cfe2-4ff4-9c94-c7f3c496594e-1566236758"}

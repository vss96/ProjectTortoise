Japanese written with kanji is much easier to read than if it is written in hiragana. There are a LOT of homophones in Japanese -- words with different meanings that sound the same (and are spelled the same in kana). You can tell these apart in normal writing because they are written with different kanji.\r\n\r\nFor example: There are two (at least) verbs pronounced \"kiru\". One of them means \"to cut\"; the other means \"to wear clothes\". The first is written 切る, and the second is written 着る. The first \"kiru\" has as part of its kanji the symbol 刀, which means sword or knife. The second is also the root of the word \"kimono\" (着物), a word which in its origin simply means \"something to wear\" or \"wearable\".\r\n\r\nBy writing 着 or 切 instead of the kana syllable \"ki\" き the written form is not ambiguous. It is clear whether you are wearing the kimono or cutting it.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167090037,"score":13,"ups":13,"subreddit":"science","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50271-8e53f757-fa21-4a03-8bc1-5a699bcb9eb3-1566236778"}

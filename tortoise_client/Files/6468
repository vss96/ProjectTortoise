If Linux wants some kudos in the desktop market, software developers need to know that their software can work on their system without huge deployment and configuration testing headaches.\r\n\r\nCurrently the answer to these problems is, \"make it open source!\" I agree with this sentiment and was well happy when Sun finally open sourced Java. But Linux still needs to appeal to the companies who are still trying to make money the \"old fashioned way\" using closed-source and IP.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of business models in the IT world. Open source software developers seem to be restricted to only a few (software as a service, etc), which makes Linux either hard to make money out of (because of the open source business model thang) or really hard to deploy on.\r\n\r\nLinux needs to embrace the closed source world just enough that it doesn't risk becoming an isolated ideological island.\r\n\r\nFlash 9: Better late than never.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1140-c7ac9817-3e3f-43bc-885e-8d58b77467c6-1566236758"}

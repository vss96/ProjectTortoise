I was just pointing out that a person's perception of reality does not create the individual. A perception that god is evident in the universe does not magically convert that person to a dogmatic, irrational person.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a person who examines the world about him and sees no evidence of a god does not suddenly lose all irrationality.\r\n\r\nOf course, our perceived environment does tend to shape us. And any rational creature will model his behavior to be congruent with his perceptions.","link_id":"t3_tbyh","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807572,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jpark","id":"ctczo","parent_id":"t1_ctcwc","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3499-47c2a67d-447b-43b8-90d2-0ec2a89bd529-1566236759"}

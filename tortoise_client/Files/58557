Both are more inconvenient than a quick smack - but when was painstaking discipline ever convenient?\r\n\r\nNo-one wants - or intends - the full weight of legal enforcement to descend on a parent who loses her temper momentarily.  But actually to approve of smacking is to give physical force a place as of right in the most formative and influential of human relationships, that between parent and child.  For sure, children need discipline, but they are also entitled not to be hit (just as adults are).  And, would Jenni smack a much bigger equally infuriating child who might hit back effectively?  I suspect not.  Physical power of the strong over the weak should not be the arbiter of conduct in our closest relationships.  Responsibility - and justice - should.\r\n\r\nJanet Whitaker","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tjyb","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165242099,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6549-c7627ce1-66d1-4394-b815-e10aa6faa903-1566236760"}

It's PUNCTUATION.  Brits have great grammar.  They just never had the punctuation clean-up that Americans experienced in mid-1900s, and so their punctuation -- including the author's -- is poorly considered and variable.  \r\n\r\nI particularly like the fact that for a \"good punctuation\" text, the title of the book is missing the serial comma.  Now, before you go after me about missing the joke: I get the joke.  But the author doesn't even get the joke right in order to *properly* misplace the comma.  The correct form should be \"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\", poorly considred British punctuation aside.  The joke form should be \"Eats shoots and leaves\".","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6563-53a4fb85-eede-4a4f-9bf4-184e1d2c1d40-1566236760"}

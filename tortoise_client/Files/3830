{"body":"The article speaks about mythological supreme Buddhas. These kind of Buddhas have perfected their said supernatural skills so they can help others. Buddha means literally awake. Theravada and Mahayana traditions think that most people can become \"lesser\" Buddhas  like Arahats. These are as \"enlightened\" (better term bodhi=awake) as any superme Buddha but have no mythological supernatural powers to help others.  \r\n\r\nBuddhism has it's own scriptures that say many things, but they should not be as seriously as Christians take Bible for example. Think yourself.\r\n\r\n*Believe nothing merely because you have been told it, or because it is\r\ntradition, or because you yourself have imagined it. Do not believe\r\nwhat your teacher tells you merely out of respect for him. But\r\nwhatever, after due examination and analysis, you find to be conducive\r\nto the good, the benefit, the welfare of all beings, believe and cling\r\nto that doctrine, and take it as your guide.* -- Buddha","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wc3m","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167384787,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t3_wc3m","edited":false,"id":"cwcci","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809601,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56513-532f8225-b744-44ef-9862-7b1d4e91a325-1566236779"}

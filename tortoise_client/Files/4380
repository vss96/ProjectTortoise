{"body":"But nobody seems to be commenting on the first, and for most outside the US, the most damning problem he identified - the handling. Put simply every average US vehicle I've ever driven wallows like a pig. Its not the steering, its the suspension and geometry of the car. \r\n\r\nThey simply are so bad they could never be sold outside the US. Nobody else could tolerate such medieval performance in the feel of the car. Hell, not even GM outside the US dares to try - that's why the designs are generally different everywhere else. There is a reason why all of the more expensive US cars have their mechanics design in Germany, Italy, UK, Japan, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen you couple that with the very basic and unrefined equipment level on most US vehicles, its no wonder they are losing out to better and more competent competitors. It would be so easy to fix as well - just copy what has already been learnt, demonstrated and become expected everywhere else.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wi17","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167574970,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":12,"ups":12,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dude78","edited":false,"id":"cwjic","parent_id":"t1_cwih3","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809735,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60111-e01c3c97-b64d-427f-b0a7-60ebead1dfcd-1566236780"}

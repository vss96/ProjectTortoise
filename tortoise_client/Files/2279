I would compare it to [Marc Salem](http://www.marcsalem.com/). If Salem was a dishonest man, he would claim to be psychic/telepathic and that he has some magical connection to the supernatural. But he says its nothing more than intuition that allows him to know the serial number of the dollar bill you're looking at, even over the phone.\r\n\r\nBut people want the simplest, coolest answer to be true, so this bird's telepathic! Assuming this bird can do what they claim, I would say it's because it possesses an intuiting capability that our french-fried brains do not.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809529,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw8es","parent_id":"t1_cw6dr","author_flair_text":null,"author":"squarehappy","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54612-f588b3e9-adb1-45da-b241-4073f5f08daf-1566236779"}

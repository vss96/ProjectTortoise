I can't imagine. Aw hail no, not aroun' heah!\r\n\r\nThat aside, it's a bullshit law and these are bullshit busts based on nothing. Even if the clerks were good ol' boys who spoke perfect English (or at least the local inbred hilljack version of English), the law and the busts are impossibly vague.\r\n\r\nIt's also quite incorrect to expect the clerk to refuse to sell lawful items in whatever combination based on the clerk's untrained suspicion that there's an evil purpose. That places clerks in danger, pisses off lawful customers, and doesn't do a damn thing about the problem. \r\n\r\nYou might require the clerk to report certain combinations of purchases or whatever, but you can't expect them to perform your surveillance for you.\r\n\r\nWhat the police should have done is simply have these \"undercover\" cops hang around the stores and observe the customers for themselves. Instead they got all excited because they got to run a sting operation just they they do up on the TV set.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54241-b691e9c1-be41-404d-b109-a2c37319004c-1566236779"}

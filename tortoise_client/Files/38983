Both rules hold true across the majority of the economy and across the majority of jobs.  Exceptions do not disprove a general rule, because I didn't claim all of them fit into the category.  Just the majority.\r\n\r\nFinancial Services isn't even related to my example.  You are confusing money with wealth creation here.  If I went and robbed a bank I would have a bunch of money, but I didn't create wealth.  If I write a book that becomes a best seller, I've actually created value that didn't exist before.  Money typically follows wealth, but there are ways to accumulate money without creating wealth, most of them dishonest.\r\n\r\nI don't know what your source on high unemployment among PhDs and engineers is.  Certainly it's higher now that there is more global competition, but that's a supply issue.  Are you making the claim though that PhDs and Engineers make approximately the same amount as an uneducated laborer at Wal-Mart?  Because that's definitely not the case.  Like it or not, there is a good statistical correlation between education and income.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_unoz","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27143-26ce3198-f461-498c-85a7-e47791ad37fd-1566236768"}

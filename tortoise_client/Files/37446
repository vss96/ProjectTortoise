Wealth isn't generated by working at a position at Wal-mart.  Instead wealth is created by making or improving something that people will pay money for or providing a service that people will pay money for.  \r\n\r\nIt's important to reconcile the notion that our system is based on supply and demand.  Why do CEO's make so much more money than entry level positions at wal-mart?  Because there are so few people who can actually do that job really well.  It's absurd to compare what the CEO of the largest company in the world (by employees) makes with what a entry level position makes.  How many people could step in and effectively run wal-mart?  How many people could effectively do an entry level wal-mart job?  That's what sets pay in this country, the demand for the job, and the supply of skilled labor to fill the position.  It's also sad that teachers, firefighters, and police make such little money compared to doctors, lawyers, and engineers.  Yet companies have to pay a certain salary in order to attact qualified candidates to fill certain jobs.\r\n\r\nKrugman derides Greenspan for saying it's about education, yet there is a very solid correlation between education and income.  That is to say people with a high school degree make less than those with a bachelors who make less than those with a masters.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with the comparison is that you are comparing a CEO who is at the very top of his profession to someone who is in poverty or someone who just works a menial job.  How many CEO's are there that make even close to what the CEO of Wal-mart makes? 10? 20? 100?  Now how many entry level employees are there in those same companies?  Millions?  Hundreds of Millions?  Globally there might even be billions.\r\n\r\nHe also talks about how the difference between the poor and the CEO has grown.  Companies are a lot bigger now than they were in the 1930's.  The CEO of wal-mart manages a far broader and much more valuable enterprise today than did CEO's of the past.  Yet the line worker really doesn't do anything of greater value than they used to.\r\n\r\nUltimately this article is very deeply flawed when it comes to a serious economic analysis of the issues.  In a nutshell he talks about how CEO's make a lot more than they used to, and they are taxed less under Bush than they used to be.  The fact of the matter is that taxes on the rich have fluctuated wildly from extremely high numbers (70% or more) down to numbers much lower than they are under Bush.  Yet even when the rich pay massive amounts in taxes, it doesn't create more wealth for the poor and under privileged classes.  Instead it just gives the government more money to spend.\r\n\r\nThe real tragedy is the amount of money flowing into the political system from rich people and corporations.  That's where serious damage is being done to the working man, and fixing that would fix a lot of the problems we have and a lot of the problems we will face.  This article didn't touch that, and the economic issues it did cover were facile, vastly over simplified, or just flat out incorrect.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26950-ea2b0b45-4836-4dcc-b82a-21279236c78b-1566236768"}

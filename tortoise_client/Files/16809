No wonder kids don't do well in school (but that's another topic.)\r\n\r\nPeople are both physically and emotionally distanced from real food. Sometimes it's not their fault--real food just isn't available at the local convenience store and there's no grocery store for miles and no car to take them there.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t9us","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165089013,"score":4,"ups":4,"author":"clarion","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctd8u","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctcek","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807577,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3626-03b1b494-474d-48fd-a985-437d25edb012-1566236759"}

It is well-written enough that some people might be persuaded by it, but all the references I've seen so far have been only to \"Creation Science\" papers or organizations, nothing that could be called independent, and the logic presented is entirely question-begging, followed by poorly explained evidence, and when the *real* evidence causes problems, throwing a Bible verse in as an explanation.\r\n\r\nExample: [Accelerated decay](http://creationwiki.org/Accelerated_decay) \r\n\r\nExcerpts below:\r\n\r\nFirst, the presupposition:\r\n&gt;The main assumption of radiometric dating is that the radioactive decay rates are constant with time. If the decay rate has varied significantly over time then any date based on radioactive decay is worthless\r\n&gt;A scientific research group called RATE ( Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth ) was formed by the Institute for Creation Research to study this issue from a creationist perspective. They have determined that the most likely times for accelerated decay were the first 2.5 days of the creation week, and during the flood and shortly thereafter\r\n\r\n*(Interestingly, this determination is based on Biblical interpretation.)*\r\n\r\nNext the \"Evidence\":\r\n&gt;Recent experiments commissioned by the RATE group indicate that \"1.5 billion years\" worth of nuclear decay have taken place, but in one or more short periods 4000 - 8000 years ago. This would shrink the alleged 4.5 billion year radioisotope age of the earth to only a few thousand years.\r\n\r\nNow the convenient Biblical explanation:\r\n&gt;The biggest objection to the possibility of accelerated nuclear decay is the fact that nuclear decay produces heat. If decay were accelerated too much, the heat would cause problems. \r\n\r\n&gt;Interestingly God gave us the solution about 3,000 years ago, in Psalms 104:2. \r\n\r\n&gt;Psalms 104:2. Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain\r\n\r\n&gt;This is a reference to the expansion of space described by General Relativity. If accelerated decay had occurred at the same time as a rapid stretching of space, that would get rid of the excess heat. \r\n \r\nIf you allow yourself the luxuries of assuming your conclusion as truth before investigating it and a convenient book of vague statements that can explain away whatever doesn't support your conclusion, you can \"prove\" anything.\r\n \r\n","link_id":"t3_wcae","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167419114,"score":3,"ups":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57236-086ecbff-b033-4e74-b66b-abcb79b9c703-1566236779"}

After all, if they had not documented the student's physical contact, the parents might have sued later.  Think of it as a preemptive strike that will have little effect on the child and to cover the teacher's aid in case of lawsuits.  Weigh the risks:\r\n\r\n-a child having a school document \"inappropriate physical contact\"  ---how many of you have ever inappropriately physically contacted (for instance, getting in a fight--oh the horror) someone while you were a kid?\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n-an adult having on their record sexual contact with a 4 year old.\r\n\r\nTeachers **have** to document everything to protect themselves.  Blame the system not the teacher's aid.","link_id":"t3_ucm2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808266,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jdhope","id":"cudzu","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cudjw","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21415-d49c722c-0f69-4a2c-9d6e-38d31147ed9b-1566236765"}

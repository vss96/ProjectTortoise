From my reading, most bicycle/car collisions are head on, or diagonal.  \"Overtaking\" accidents are surprisingly rare.\r\n\r\nAnd on that note, most bike lights are for *being seen* not *seeing*.  You don't want a light to shine directly in a drivers eyes, ever, because then they can not see properly to avoid you.\r\n\r\nThe only time you need a light to show you where you are going is if you are on trails at night.  I suppose people might also use such a light on an otherwise dark rural road at night, but that seems foolish.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808561,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_usr7","id":"cutpa","author":"SoPoOneO","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"29067-975961fd-b55f-4cc5-b854-962e62c99a70-1566236768"}

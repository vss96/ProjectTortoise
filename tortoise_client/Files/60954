It's funny being a western parent who has \"tried on the garment\" of theories about incoporating ethnic roots and attempting to harmonize them with \"modern practices.\"  Un or fortuately Number 1 (20 years) was the subject of an experiment.  (Which fortunately turned out okay.)  But - we had our trials and tribulations.     And yes - at one point I did invite her to contemplate the consequences of her actions by calling the police.  We all had a lovely chat. She told them her story.  (Poor deprived child forced to suffer a private school environment.)  They told her she was a pretentious, spoiled brat who needed to get real, be thankful and informed her that everyone at the station would be happy to show her how self-absorbed and silly she was.  She declined.  Her attitude changed.  It became exceptionally clear that we would *never* tolerate violence in our home.  The rest of the teen years were spent more or less productively.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a young parent - I had all of these grandiose ideas about \"putting the time in up front so as to secure an easy adolescence.\"  Boy, was I wrong.  And Jiminy Cricket was I right!  Luckily - I'm getting a \"do over.\"  My 3 year old suffers/benefits from all of his sibling's hindsight.  But - in no way am I even pretending the teen years won't be awful.  My daughter's primary criticism of our parenting choices revolve around the fact that we created a lovely bubble for her.  In her words, \"we handicapped her\" by putting her in environments which supported \"cooperation, imagination, self-direction, harmony and diversity.\"  One year ago, she said, \"I should have learned to be a back-stabbing, superfical bitch by the time I was eight.\"  Now that she is 20 she says, \"I can't believe my useless, clueless, pathetic generation!\"\r\n\r\nBut, the end result is that we gave her the skills necessary to evaluate who she wanted to be; create that persona for herself; and shift into the woman she wants to be.  We did this by contemplating all of the data available; assessing our choices; making uncomfortable decisions and then....*following our hearts* rather than the formulas of experts.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808019,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cu0us","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctzlt","author_flair_text":null,"author":"svaha","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14421-6f1e984b-a50a-44f1-9f89-99adce812c88-1566236762"}

I hope you agree that the sentence \"It is a worker's lot in life\" makes a general statement about workers even though its genitive noun phrase is singular. We can argue about what is and is not idiomatic usage all day long--my own gut feeling is that the singular form is more idiomatic--but I'm fairly confident both forms are correct from a syntactical as well as semantical perspective in this particular case.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ti1d","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165243128,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6580-bbf20193-5a1e-4003-8045-612cd4860d54-1566236760"}

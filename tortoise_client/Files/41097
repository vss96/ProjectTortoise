And in MEMRI also, and on CSPAN. Only you my friend know that all translations of iran's president are wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd by the way I'm not ready to take the Juans Cole translations of Iranian president. Find somebody more credible. ok?\r\n\r\nSo answer my one simple question DID HE SAID THIS SENTENCE?\r\n&gt;  \"They have fabricated a legend under the name Massacre of the Jews, and they hold it higher than God himself, religion itself and the prophets themselves.\r\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/news/archive/archive?ArchiveId=17019\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is too late to question why the jews decided to make their state where thy decided. Israel already exists. And the only way do destroy it with superior military power. Palestinian state will be created also. When? May be a little bit after the palestinians will stop killing each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you speak Arabic? Translate this.\r\n\r\nhttp://memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=1222\r\n\r\nAlso bad translation. Or may be you just don't want to hear what he really says...\r\n","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166484190,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cva8d","parent_id":"t1_cv65c","author":"marglexx","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808873,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37069-953f6ec7-313a-4518-adfa-333bc59f04c7-1566236772"}

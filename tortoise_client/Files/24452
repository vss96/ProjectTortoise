{"controversiality":0,"body":"I don't mind at all fat people who are fat and happy with being that way....more power to them.  A lot of the fat people I've known, however, constantly whine about being fat (and being depressed because they're fat).  \r\n\r\nOne friend in particular constantly talks about how she doesn't eat that much, and can't understand why she isn't losing weight, and she can’t get a boyfriend, blah blah blah.  I've eaten out with her many times, and she usually eats about twice as much as I do (and I'm 6'2, 175 pounds), drinks non-diet soft drinks, and *always* gets something fried and then some kind of dessert.   I’m pretty sure she eats similar things for most meals, drinks regular Coke all day, and doesn’t make any attempt whatsoever to exercise.   \r\n\r\nWhile I certainly don't advocate name-calling and I don’t treat fat people any differently than I would other people, I find myself not being able to muster any sympathy for this variety of fat person. And yeah, I’ll admit it…it kind of disgusts me.  While it’s true that one’s metabolism can predispose one to weight gain, there’s a simple solution to that problem: eat less and exercise.  Don’t drink sugared drinks, and quit stuffing your face with fried fast foods.  Once you get past a certain weight and move from being ‘just overweight’ to ‘grossly obese’, the old metabolism argument just doesn’t hold up.  If you’re really that unhappy being fat, do something about it, or stop fucking complaining.\r\n","link_id":"t3_vizl","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166662650,"score":13,"ups":13,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"bac9705","id":"cvki6","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvk5z","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809071,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42250-9c794409-a792-408a-bc8f-f16a9e78775b-1566236774"}

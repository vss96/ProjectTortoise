The only possible reason sales tax is less unethical, is that people might willing help the disabled, so impersonating the disabled might be more ethically dubious.  But that's beside the point--since murder is worse than theft, should we tell the police to stop arresting thieves until all murderers are behind bars?  Of course not.  Fraud is unethical whether or not other crimes are being committed.\r\n\r\nIf you were just crying hypocrisy, then the difference is a little more subtle.  A million people who each steal a dollar might seem hypocritical when they criticize one person who steals a million dollars, but there has to be a line dawn somewhere.  Otherwise you rapidly escalate into nonsense: Jim stole a dollar, so why can't I steal ten?  You spat on my car, so why don't I drown your cat?\r\n\r\nMy guess (based on your screenname) is that you think dodging sales tax is OK, perhaps even a *good* thing, and by excusing a $200k fraud case, you feel justified excusing your own, much smaller theft.  And that is logically consistent, so in a way I understand your point.  I just disagree with you, and so do 11 others, apparently.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808091,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu4qs","parent_id":"t1_cu1nq","author_flair_text":null,"author":"plexluthor","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16245-835d7679-92e1-4c1c-81cb-cbee0b2a393b-1566236763"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Exactly. Negative PR hurts Wal-Marts growth because it gives ammunition to activists who'd rather see them NOT come to their little down. \r\n\r\nThat, in turn, can hurt their growth. Especially when stores like Target don't get hit with PR for capping wages (I'm sure they do it -- pretty much all these companies have the same management policies designed to keep costs down.)\r\n\r\nThe real question is, should these efforts to placate protesting employees fail, will the employees take (what I believe to be) the next logical step and unionize? Its one thing to close up shop at a store in Canada, but to do it in small towns across America could be disastrous from a PR perspective.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tiui","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1165242544,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"redrobot5050","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctjzd","parent_id":"t1_ctjoi","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807705,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6561-77a89fbb-7cd9-431a-a82c-493fcc572d47-1566236760"}

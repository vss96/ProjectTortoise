I can't tell you the number of nights I have cried myself to sleep, begging God to take this away.\"\r\n\r\nSo is it true then that what drives the most vocal opponents of homosexuality is their own fear for it? Is it that their fear and loathing for themselves gets somehow vocalized as a general outrage against the object of their fear (and all those that are touched by it)? When they rage and rail against homosexuality, are they really trying to drown their deepest fears? By screaming loud enough do they hope to somehow erase from their minds every iota of that unbearable realization?\r\n\r\nAll I can say is poor child. Maybe one day we will be free of all superstitions - including religion.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808360,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cuiwq","parent_id":"t3_uhv4","author":"aagee","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24019-33122b60-95f9-46d6-bf0b-7c7c69381a3e-1566236767"}

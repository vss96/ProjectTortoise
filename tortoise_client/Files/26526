Your thinking anything different is the result of retcon, retroactive continuity change. Rewriting history.\r\n\r\nNon-determinism is complete fucking gibberish. Not only does no experiment prove it but Gregory Chaitin proved that **no conceivable experiment** could **ever** prove it. And his proof was both masterfully simple and was based on assumptions simple enough to contain no loopholes. Unlike Bell's so-called theorem. And unlike so-called Bell's theorem which \"proved\" that magic happens, Chaitin's theorem proves only that non-determinism is meaningless gibberish. Something that is obvious from simple inspection.\r\n\r\nObvious from the fact that in over a century of physics, physicists STILL haven't come up with a SINGLE formal definition of non-determinism. You know why? Because you can't create a formal definition for a non-concept!! Non-determinism *isn't even a concept*. You know how certain ideas are wrong? And others are so stupid that they are Not Even Wrong? Well non-determinism isn't even that because it's *not even intelligible*.\r\n\r\nI have a LOT of empathy but I can have no empathy for people who ritualistically nod their heads when they hear gibberish. I hold such people in far too much contempt to empathize with them. This incidentally is not a \"problem\", it is SANITY.\r\n\r\nAs for QM being a very good model of the world, this is total crap. QM is a very good model for a very narrow energy domain, between 'very small' and 'extremely small'. Beyond the extremely small, QM breaks down by spitting back gibberish. And above the very small, it can't even be applied to reality.

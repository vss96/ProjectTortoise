{"body":"I'm familiar with Russell's teapot argument, and I find it flawless, thank you.\r\n\r\nMy argument is against the statement:\r\n&gt;Atheists do not presume - they look at evidence and then decide. One could hardly call that arrognace. If anything, they could claim to be smarter at the very least - for that.\r\n\r\nYou cannot base your atheism on evidence if you have none.\r\nNote: you will notice I never in fact argued against atheism, only Raoulmeister's claim.\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nMy apologies decaff, I didn't fully read your post the first time, and responded incorrectly. The first sentance of your post actually illustrates my argument against Raoulmeister (above). Namely that you can't base your atheism on evidence.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx5n","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167012497,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"Grarg","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvygm","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvy31","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809338,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49279-fc5548f9-cde6-47b3-9f1b-db9dc2df6dad-1566236777"}

The way you phrase weak atheism makes it sound like both positions are equally unlikely. But would you treat a person who *truly* believed in a Flying Spaghetti Monster with the same gravitas you do to Christians? Probably not. And that's Dawkins's point.

Chance can easily wipe out fit individuals, but is unlikely to consistently attack the fittest across an entire species... unless it affects an entire species such as whatever wiped out the dinosaurs and allowed mammals to flourish.\r\n\r\nSociety, I grant you, can be very unevolutionary, but that's because humans are no longer subject to purely natural selection. We can act to deliberately subvert natural selection if we want.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vcwg","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166583850,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40065-59ff4e04-89ef-41b8-9f5c-05f078a0dde0-1566236773"}

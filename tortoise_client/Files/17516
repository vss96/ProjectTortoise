I have been on an insurance committee and also bought my own (self-employed). Insurance companies do not act with ethics. If you try to buy insurance, they start out merely expensive, but increase prices every year -- finally I stopped writing the ever-growing monthly checks (I enjoy very good health and good luck, I'm a veteran). I don't relish a Government health-insurance program, but the insurance companies simply cannot be trusted without some oversight. \r\n\r\n*Someone* is sure to find fault with whatever is suggested, but these are often the people who never accomplish very much and always try to impede progress of any kind. We need a solution that will provide health care for as many people as possible.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34418-ce397287-251b-4d7b-bffb-963c65889776-1566236771"}

They go to amazing lengths to ensure that, even though there may be six or seven Goofys wandering around the park, you can't see more than one of them from any single place, for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nIn Disneyspeak, this is called \"preserving the magic.\" An example from my wife, who used to work at the MGM Studios park in Orlando: a small girl was scared to go on the Tower of Terror, and asked if those were real people screaming from the ride. My wife's response was, \"The ride screams at 6am, before the park opens.\" This, apparently, was not smiled upon by her boss; if you take away the illusion of reality from the parks, there isn't much left.\r\n\r\nIs it so evil to try to do this with Santa Claus? No matter his intentions, who knows how many children discovered Santa Claus wasn't real while they were at Disney World, all because he said \"ho ho ho.\"","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vciv","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166547240,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38600-15667607-0e09-4baf-acac-a84fc4360d9b-1566236773"}

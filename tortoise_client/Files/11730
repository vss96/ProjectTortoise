More important is readability which isn't always bound to the number of lines.\r\n\r\nAn example: Lets compare\r\n\r\n    return x &gt; y ? (x &gt; z ? x : z) : (y &gt; z ? y : z);\r\n\r\nwith\r\n   \r\n    int maximum;\r\n    if (x &gt; y) {\r\n       if (x &gt; z) maximum = x;\r\n       else maximum = z;\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n       if (y &gt; z) maximum = y;\r\n       else maximum = z;\r\n    }\r\n    return maximum;\r\n\r\nWe have here 1 line compared to 8 lines (without the '}' lines). But is the latter really 8 times a difficult to write and to maintain? I really doubt it. In fact the latter is better readable, first because of the naming of the return value (which is self documentary) and because the different cases are visually separated and not in one line.\r\n\r\nSure, the above is a bit contrived, but I suspect that there is really some 'golden middle' between to short and to long To short can harm like to long can. Otherwise we all would program in something like APL where they considered even names as to long and invented lots of funny symbols for operations.\r\n\r\nAnd think about redundancy in natural language. It's always possible to express something without using lots of fill words - but its harder to understand. \r\n\r\nLets reformulate the last paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Think: redundancy in natural language. Always possible expressing with less words - but harder understand\"\r\n\r\nWe can even get rid of certain letters:\r\n\r\n\"Thnk: rdndncy in naturl lnguage. Alwys possbl xprssng wth lss wrds - but hardr ndrstnd\"\r\n\r\nImagine a whole book in this abbreviated language. It would contain the same informations, but it would be much harder to read. Redundancy (even in layout) is a good thing. The real problem is if a language requires unnecessary complex formulations because of to simple abstractions.\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808721,"gilded":0,"id":"cv25m","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv1wx","author":"kawa","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32928-5f3b555d-59d9-4e35-8fae-94d06fb93f86-1566236770"}

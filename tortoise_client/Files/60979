It'd be all fun and games with a generous dash of \"there is no god but Allah\" and a side of \"bomb the infidels\"\r\n\r\nI entirely agree with you, kids should make their own decisions, and true decisions come with information. Thus we should inform our kids of everything we think is good for them, but bring their attention to everything bad.\r\n\r\nHow about \"Moral development camps\" instead. Moral situations could be dressed up in games and songs, children would be presented with different solutions and encouraged to develop their own set of values. They could be tought a bit about the world religions. It would be a lot less harmful then ramming the bible into their little minds.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165747248,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuaxl","id":"cubdb","author":"Grim_Chook","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808218,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"19959-b41c6db6-8b0a-4255-a0ee-6b0dfee35627-1566236765"}

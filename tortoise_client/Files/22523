{"body":"There are complications because Romaji encourages English pronunciations, which can mangle Japanese words. It also isn't a clean match to their syllabic language. Kana are arranged in a sparse 5x10 matrix of vowel consonant pairs with two standard modifiers with predictable effect (maru does h-&gt;p and tenten does k-&gt;g, s-&gt;z, t-&gt;d, h-&gt;b). In fact, the Romaji obscure some of this because for example \"chi\" is actually a T column (ti) and it converts with tenten to \"ji\" (di).","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vzzg","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","created_utc":1167183312,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"JulianMorrison","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw3uu","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw0ie","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809439,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52106-c7fc4b28-1f96-4464-9fcb-4bcc36e04045-1566236778"}

Always has been, always will be. Fine. The words they speak, the acts they inflict, are not in any sense divinely inspired or authorised.\r\n\r\nThere is no divine guidance, no special \"religious\" importance to be attached to anything the Church does or says. Because if there were, you might expect a higher moral, a better code of conduct. Their God then, if he exists at all, does not make them better people.\r\n\r\nThe Church itself, however, *does* lay claim to divine guidance, and specializes in telling people how to act. Thus they can and should be judged to a higher standard. Other corrupt human institutions are at least not that hypocritical and patronizing.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32512-fb0bb130-7f18-4d72-80a7-cbed77ee30ea-1566236770"}

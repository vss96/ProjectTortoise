I was lambasted pretty heavily by those that claimed they'd change the world.  I still stand by my conclusions though.\r\n\r\nComputers have become substitutes for the real \"thing\" (insert your *thing* **here**).  *Feel that?*\r\n\r\nNo you didn't.  You didn't feel a thing.  You didn't because you can't.  You're insulated from the real world.  What you have is a poor substitute glowing in front of you, without all the messiness and emotional investment required in real life.\r\n\r\nReal life isn't found online, or behind a ten thousand line program.  It's out *there*.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u0vn","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808055,"distinguished":null,"author":"lifeofliberty","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu2pf","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u0vn","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15356-b47fdbec-b91a-4e8f-a12c-e27aa4f4fc2a-1566236762"}

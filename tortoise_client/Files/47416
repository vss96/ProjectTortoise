{"body":"&gt;Measuring it means humans are more powerful or better than God? Why?\r\n\r\nYou misread my words.  I said putting God in a controlled experiment would mean that.  It would mean that because of the term \"controlled.\"\r\n\r\n&gt;Either there is an effect in the universe or there isn't.\r\n\r\nIf the effects are purely qualitative and not quantitative then while one might be able to measure by some sense of the term, one could not take a scientific measurement.  Another way to say this would be to say that the effects of God are qualities incommensurate with quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;Religious people seem to happily define and redefine God mid-sentence, if you really believed in God why would you think you can just think up new definitions and attributes for him/her/it all the time.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly not a case of redefining things at all.  While the peculiarities of my expression might be different, the idea I expressed is not at all new, it can be found in Augustine (354-430 AD).  \r\n\r\nBeyond that, I'd say that theology is like math, as one investigates and comes to better understandings, at times certain axiomatic definitions can be changed to better account for things.  The theological work I am most interested in is developed as logical axiomatic systems following the pattern of Euclid.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.esotericarchives.com/proclus/metaelem.htm","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_une1","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166058700,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cupo0","edited":false,"id":"cupr8","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808488,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27200-9b1d8936-f13b-45b4-a82b-36ef1d7af641-1566236768"}

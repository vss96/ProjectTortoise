Not only is this not a problem, it is what you ought to want if your goal is to help the neediest. If the rich aren't spending their money on themselves, then they only have two alternatives. 1) Give the money to help others 2) Invest their money to create new wealth. There is no magic investing machine where you put you rmoney in and get a positive return on that money back, let alone a fabulously positive return. You need to have an idea with merit, risk your precious money that you could instead be spending on yourself, **employ people at a better wage/compensation package than they can get elsewhere** to leverage your idea (or someone else's idea) and your money into **creating** a product or service that people want to buy at a price they can afford that is lower or equal to the competition's price. And that price has to be higher than the cost of your fixed overhead, employees, and the basic supplies you bought to create your end product.\r\n\r\nThen, after giving employees better jobs tan they could have had otherwise, and giving customers a better product or service than they otherwise would have had, then and only then do the rich get to have a profit. Thus profit is not a dirty word, but the end result of doing several good things for \"society\".\r\n\r\nAnd you would have the rich forgo this process and spend their money on themselves instead....","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807827,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctqaa","id":"ctqh2","author":"happyjuggler0","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9620-48362d5d-bdde-46a1-b519-ac34ac120b2d-1566236761"}

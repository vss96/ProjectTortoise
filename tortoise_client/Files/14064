{"body":"Coming from the Detroit area I would feel pretty guilty buying a foreign car, but lately they are turning out nothing but junk.  There's no way I'd buy an american car right now.  It's not just poor quality or bad gas milage, but they're designed with absolutely no imagination at all.  They seem engineered by committee.  They're a symbol of american culture.  It's heartbreaking.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wi17","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167545737,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":15,"score":15,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_cwir7","edited":false,"id":"cwitn","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809722,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59762-ef010566-9482-46d3-90b8-2fefcbc91b05-1566236780"}

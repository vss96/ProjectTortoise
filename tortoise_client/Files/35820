What's the phrase they use? \"My mother was a test tube and my father was a knife\"? They also become friends because that bond leads them to trust one another and to escape. Don't forget that the other woman (the one who was acting as maid to Friday) also escaped with them.\r\n\r\nIt's not like she went *hunting* for sex. She just stumbled upon men (and women) who were interested in her and decided, \"hey, why the fuck not?\" It doesn't matter anyway. She has the freedom to do whatever she pleases. Heinlein makes this point (about individual freedom) in a few of his books (the ones I can think of are Stranger in a Strange Land and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress).","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50737-ee0b538d-0426-4d32-ae93-b3035d6c7216-1566236778"}

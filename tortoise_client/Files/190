Real median wages have been in decline since 1970.  Go look it up.  The trend has accelerated in recent years.  It's not a matter of cherry picking.  The middle class has less disposable income now than in the past.\r\n\r\nYour claim of ever increasing material abundance is baseless.  A select few consumer items have got cheaper and improved in quality, like electronics and cars.  All the big stuff like education, housing, basic medical care, gasoline and heating, and food are much more expensive now relative to median wages.  Quality is arguably worse, too.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165613383,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17049-e6c4d962-0f32-4d1e-a1f3-ad075232a2d5-1566236763"}

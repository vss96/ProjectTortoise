Power consumption is current x voltage drop so a standard LED would consume all of about 24mW.  \r\n\r\nThe rear light of my bike cost $12 and can be easily seen for a couple of hundred metres at night - perfectly adequate.  It has 5 LEDs so it would draw no more than about 150mW.  \r\n\r\nThe DiNotte light has a 3W LED.  It uses 20 times the amount of power my regular tail light does so its batteries will go flat 20 times as fast.  \r\n\r\nThe DiNotte light costs 10 times as much as my regular one and the batteries will go flat 20 times as fast.  Why would I want one?","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166173362,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuvmu","parent_id":"t3_usr7","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","retrieved_on":1473808596,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30023-a2324416-0efa-4a90-bc34-67e858bfbc99-1566236769"}

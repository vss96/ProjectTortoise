{"body":"&gt; While there certainly seems to be an unfair anti-Israel tendency, it is not greater than that in the world at large, and in my experience well-framed arguments are well-received here.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, reality has an anti-Israeli bias. You cannot act like their government acts and not result a creating a lot of people that do not like your policies. Israel is guilty of all the things we often look down upon Arabic countries for. They are exceptionally racist and treat the Arabs in their country as sub-human. You think women have it bad over there? Try going through checkpoints just to go to the shops. Try getting your pregnant wife to the hospital through those checkpoints before she dies. Try running a business in that environment. They don't stand a chance and the terrorism from the Palestinians is a direct result of this. The vast majority of suicide bombers have lost friends and family and are essentially taking revenge. Given a similar situation, I'd likely do the same thing. Mess with my family and I will mess you up. It's the same the world over. \r\n\r\nIt's compounded by the fact that mainstream media refuses to say anything bad about them, so there is a lot of frustration in the world about the issue.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vat3","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":-4,"score":-4,"created_utc":1166549171,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"BraveSirRobin","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvde7","edited":false,"id":"cvdn7","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808937,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38694-caeff5e1-b19f-42b3-a0e5-7c302478417d-1566236773"}

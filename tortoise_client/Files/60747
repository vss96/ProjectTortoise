{"body":"A POS 'Red Rider' BB-Gun will penetrate skin, I know this for *fact*, as one of my friends in elementary school was screwing with one with his brothers and one of them ended up with a BB embedded in their arm that had to be surgically removed.  I also know that anything that will shoot a hole in one side and out the other of an empty Campbell's Soup can (like my old pellet gun when I was a kid) will sure as fuck put a hole in at least one side of a kid.  If you think that a pellet gun pistol will 'at most bruise somebody' you clearly haven't played with them enough.  Competition paintball tournaments generally [limit velocity to 300fps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintball#Paintball_Velocity) because after that they tend to break skin and crack bones.  Pellet pistols can easily hit 400 - 450fps, and fire hard metal [pointed](http://www.airgunexpress.com/Accessories/BeemanPellets/beemansilversting201-08-3020+.htm), [tipped](http://www.airgunexpress.com/Accessories/Predator-JSB%20Pellets/predator.177pellets603-08-1777.htm), or even [hollow point](http://www.airgunexpress.com/Accessories/Predator-JSB%20Pellets/predatorhollowpoint603-08-7111+.htm) ammunition. As much as I hate the 'pussification' of America and love to laugh at stupid warning labels, the big '**This Is Not A Toy**' label all of these guns carry **is** serious.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uvo6","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166237910,"author":"oditogre","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuzpd","parent_id":"t1_cuz7s","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808674,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31909-2771ffbf-b117-4686-b1a6-d7a2cad87460-1566236770"}

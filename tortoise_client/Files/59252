Polls indicate that roughly 50% of American citizens believe that man is 6000 years old, not that the universe is 6000 years old. thevalarauk seems to be making the point that only evangelical Christians believe that the Earth is 6,000 years old, and that evangelical Christians make up a much smaller percentage of the population.\r\n\r\nradrik, you're missing thevalarauk's point. he doesn't seem to me to be making the distinction you mention, as there's no talk of \"creative, social, loving\" etc. he's saying that the statistics don't say what everyone here seems to think they say.\r\n\r\ntechnically, i agree with thevalarauk- i don't think they say exactly that half of Americans think that the universe is 6,000 years old, but i think they say enough. personally, i think the statistics do show (or give credence to the idea) that a large percentage of Americans are either creationists, believe the world is relatively young, or would base their understanding of the world's age by the Bible, and not by a scientific estimate. anything more on the matter is just splitting hairs. i'd tend to read from these polls that there are far more evangelical Christians than thevalarauk would believe.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807852,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctrg0","edited":false,"id":"ctrtz","author":"carpeliam","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10353-0910789c-f1d3-4ae9-a594-1109de25f59d-1566236761"}

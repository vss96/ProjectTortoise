{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ual4","subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"*\"Tough sentencing laws, record numbers of drug offenders and high crime rates have contributed to the United States having the largest prison population and the highest rate of incarceration in the world, according to criminal justice experts.\"*\r\n\r\nI basically lost all interest when I read the opening statement, since it is provably false.  We do indeed have the highest rates of incarceration, but it's not because of \"high crime rates\".\r\n\r\nAs the statistics you linked to above show, it is **not** because the US has higher crime rates - it's because of our so-called \"legal\" system that is hell bent on making victemless \"crimes\" punishable.\r\n\r\nThere are of course, other factors, such as the oppression of the poor and disenfranchised which does lead to crime (many of which are also victimless). \r\n\r\nOur legal system is worse then sucky, it's totally out of all control. This would include the entire apparatus of \"law enforcement\", another blighted institution that should be burned to the ground and rebuilt.\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165770437,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuc4j","parent_id":"t1_cub9h","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lifeofliberty","retrieved_on":1473808232,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20316-830de120-c12d-4d36-99df-c4ebc701522e-1566236765"}

I don't recall seeing something like this, and I'm curious what this next best thing could be.\r\n\r\n&gt; One of the members immediately starts moaning about the terrible conditions at Wired, and how sad he is.\r\n\r\nHe did also remark about having \"more zeroes than he had ever imagined possible\" in his bank account.  For me, a six figure bank account is easily imaginable: you can get that from working 2 years at a decent job.  So I interpreted that as at least 7 figures, which would indicate a sale price in the $10-20M range.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to see the numbers.

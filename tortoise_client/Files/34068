{"controversiality":0,"body":"\"the truth is the next generation is bound to be a more sophisticated audience\"\r\n\r\nCough.  This strikes me as a very questionable remark. \r\n\r\nIt's true that because they have a larger total body of music to listen to, the most recent generation *could in theory* be more sophisticated.  \r\n\r\nRealistically, however, they seem less sophisticated, because today's mass audiences pay little to no attention to classical/jazz/fusion, etc., and the music they do listen to is rather simplistic in comparison. I suspect my grandfather's generation -- which was far more cognizant of melody, harmony and counterpoint -- was significantly more sophisticated musically than today's.  \r\n\r\nThis is apparent even when we confine analysis to pop music.  Compare the subtleties of a human being improvising a sax solo over a chord progression in a big-band swing hit then to the ludicrous simplicity of a computer-generated bassline in a top forty hiphop hit today.  It's really not even close.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tn3v","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":11,"ups":11,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165307407,"author":"sixstrings","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctnm8","edited":false,"id":"cto1i","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807781,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8532-a1985fc4-df5f-4dba-82eb-d02e72586ba5-1566236760"}

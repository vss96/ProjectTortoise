If artists were concerned with trying to appeal to all humans, we'd still be in the stone-ages of art. It would be like the sciences sticking to things that all people can understand; \"Let's hold off on that DNA research, there are still a few people in West Virginia and Madagascar that don't get it.\" In my book, this kind of writing is irresponsible. We should be encouraging people to maintain an open mind and look at some of the literature out there to figure out what it's all about. It appears to me that you, Paul Graham, really have no idea how artists today work.","controversiality":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165866673,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23026-afaeb0da-018f-4ce6-a71f-ddd6ef68b4dd-1566236766"}

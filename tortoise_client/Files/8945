Sometimes the people have more power and therefore the society appears to support rights.  Sometimes the state has more power and appears to oppress rights.\r\n\r\nAll of this is important to know because it affects people's attitudes.  People who think their rights are being trampled are more likely to be passive and trust in some authority to sort things out.  People who realize that the underlying issue is power are a lot more likely to act since they understand they are responsible for creating their world.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wgpl","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167516401,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59130-935ace80-8087-4784-b766-076e38229325-1566236780"}

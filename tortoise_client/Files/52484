If we end up having to pay higher salaries, if that ensures a higher standard for teachers, then it will be more than worth it. Society will end up with less sociopaths, young people with a much higher quality of education and better suited to find their place in this world.","link_id":"t3_uk3d","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808393,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"DA5lD","edited":false,"id":"cukmb","parent_id":"t3_uk3d","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24795-62260fec-33f8-472b-ba60-485c8d323a68-1566236767"}

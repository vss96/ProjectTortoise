This often confuses people into thinking that it must be undefined, but being an indeterminate form is really more an expression of the behaviour close to (0,0), and has nothing to do with the value of the function at the origin.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ty8s","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38417-1cca73ba-482b-4b7a-9521-f662c69e93b5-1566236773"}

Hard drives are waranteed usually from 3-6 years of the date of manufacture on top of the drive. Also, you can easily check the serial number and get RMA availability on the makers website and even do the whole RMA without talking to a single person. Just mark the drive as \"noisy\" or something like that and get an advanced RMA replacement for it. Those usually arive within a week, then you box up your old drive and ship it out.

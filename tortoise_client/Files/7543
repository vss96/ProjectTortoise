{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tu1t","stickied":false,"body":"Young people reading this should note, however, that if they start to disbelieve the Bible, this is still not a straight line to a disbelief in Jesus or a disbelief in God, and I would say especially not a disbelief in God. It just means a messed up book. When you read [The Hiram Key](http://www.amazon.com/Hiram-Key-Pharaohs-Freemasonry-Discovery/dp/1931412758/sr=1-1/qid=1165472416/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-8291954-0367065?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books), the authors lay out a lot of new information for me about how the Bible as well as the story of Jesus came to be, and it was a bit shocking. However, because of a lot of long nature walks, deaths of relatives, analysis of science, and experiencing the life-changing event of an earthquake, I have definitely found a profound and peaceful belief in God after all these years. I was raised an atheist, became agnostic, became a converted Christian, and then became a non-Christian deist. I visit church on Sundays as duty to my children and marriage, because they are believers and I don't want to drag them down the road of my new beliefs to make this their beliefs.\r\n\r\nNote also that at one time in my life I was so down and out with my situation, and with a feeling that God had forsaken me, that I tried to commit suicide. I was 19 years old and it was a long time ago. After years of counseling for this event, marriage, fatherhood, and a lot of self-analysis and reading, I now fear other teenagers and young adults going down the path of being shocked with their religious books and taking drastic, self-destructive measures against themselves.\r\n\r\nSo, no, a disbelief in many Bible passages is not a reason for a Christian to take their own lives because they suddenly have lost their meaning, and it is also not a straight line proof for a disbelief in Jesus or God.\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165472911,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cty4b","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tu1t","author":"supermike","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807968,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13308-8310b6b6-fef6-4619-b9e4-631a0c4fe7a4-1566236762"}

In high school I was a geeky kid around the time the columbine killing happened. I was sick of getting bullied, so I threatened to \"pull a columbine\". Of course I'd never do it, but you remember how confusing it is to be in high school. Anyway, in the principals office, they told me they wouldn't be shutting the school down or anything and that they were getting anonymous bomb threats several times a week. All they did was keep it quiet.\r\n\r\nThis happens constantly at malls and other stores as well. If they gave in, they'd have to close it every time, and after the word got out that they caved, even more people would start calling in threats. Sadly, in a world where suicide bombings are a reality, threats mean very little.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167413066,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57026-9529aa4c-e255-4b88-96fc-4fb5e65c1caf-1566236779"}

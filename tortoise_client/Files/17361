Yahoo and Mapquest are sending you down into California to avoid the mountains! If you were not familiar with the area and the danger of those mountains, the Google route looks great and a lot more direct. But then zoom in on the Google route and the paths of the roads alone tell you that these are not wide, flat, well-traveled highways.

I (and probably a lot of other reddit users) refuse to take that feature into account when voting since it would then make a difference in which order people vote (some people might not downvote a comment at -4 any further, later 10 people upvote it, it ends up at +6 but would more likely be a lot lower without comment hiding).","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165231450,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6344-36298c3a-4d26-48c0-8ff5-bdf377ecccf9-1566236760"}

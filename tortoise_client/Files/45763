Thanks for the suggestions. I've actually been interested in the topic since reading Eric Schlosser's  \"Fast Food Nation\". Although Schlosser focused on beef in the book, many of the issues are similar. Also interesting - buried in this article was the fact that Smithfield had recently acquired Swift. Yeah, Swift from Greeley, Co - the meat packing co. busted for hiring illegal immigrants. (another detail fantastically outlined in Schlosser's book.) \r\n\r\nAnyway - \r\nI've been shopping at places like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's ever since. But now I'd like to go even more local, personally.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v5ba","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1166456329,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"35913-7fa99c12-be93-4c6a-aa39-9fb72207db3a-1566236772"}

I never saw the point in spending hundreds to thousands of dollars on something so small, and to me, worthless.  \r\n\r\nI can take a nice vacation with the money or we can get a several video games or build a new computer or fix stuff up around the house with the money.  These are things we can do together and have some nice memories of.  \r\n\r\nSince it's time to blow money for the holidays I see advertisements for diamonds all the time now.  Whenever I see \"this ring only $2999\"  I think, \"crap, we can spend 10 days in Italy, everything paid for with that.\"  A diamond is just a shiny piece of rock you can look at.  I much prefer looking at my shiny piece of pryite, which is worth nothing as well because I found it.\r\n\r\nThe only jewelry I wear is my wedding band (no not an expensive ring), and a pair of ruby earrings.  They are the only earrings I own.  *shrug*  I guess the I wasn't taught how to be a diamond loving whore when I was younger.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u6tj","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808174,"author":"berberine","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu915","parent_id":"t3_u6tj","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18675-7a4f3b70-f6c7-4e87-b133-fc157a3b9a1e-1566236764"}

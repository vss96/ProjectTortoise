Substitute JScript for VBScript, and you've described my mindset exactly. I like the static nature which  \"Classic\" ASP 3.0 has taken on since .NET hit the scene. Nice and predictable and stable. I've been in it for years, I know all the quirks and warts, and I've got tons of reusable code.\r\n\r\nI can trust myself to keep code and presentation separate, to abstract redundant code up into libraries, and to make sure I'm kicking standard-compliant output to the browser. \r\n\r\nAlso, I like using the same language both client and server side. It has benefits of additional code reuse, and one less language to mentally context-switch in and out of.\r\n\r\nI know enough Perl and Python to be useful, but it's going to be a while before I'm as productive in either of them as I am with ASP, ADO and JavaScript. I'm inclined to ride out ASP on IIS as long as I can for the time being.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w0ju","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50757-e141f37d-9ad3-4aef-85cb-2213165eb395-1566236778"}

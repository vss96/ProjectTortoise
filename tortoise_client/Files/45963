I saw how a Mac works and it's just eye-candy useless stuff; I never understand what is it with all the Mac fanatics, I guess the Apple corporate culture and propaganda is extremely good in America.\r\n\r\nThe only way I would by a Mac would be if I didn't care at all how I spend my money, and not even then because you can't do anything with a Mac. Why should I pay 5 times the price for a mouse (or any other Mac product) just because it's for a Mac, when the PC equivalent is just as good or even better. The Mac market is monopolised by Apple which has products that don't even rise to the level found on PC. The Mac hardware and software is overpriced and mostly outdated, oh but I admit it's very colorful and pretty if that makes you feel better.\r\n\r\nI don't need to be limited by a corporation who tells me what my computer should or should not have, when all my PCs are handmade by me.\r\n\r\nOh, and cut the crap with Windows instability, XP is just as stable as a Mac or Linux, if I hear one more guy who complains of XP instability it means he is making it up ( I had 0 crashes on my XP at work this year while on a Mac , while using it a few times at my university, it crashed several times, Linux is not bulletproof either).\r\n\r\nI don't like Microsoft at all but I dislike Apple even more for their brainwashing.\r\n\r\nI use Linux right now and I admit at the moment I can't recommend it to nontechnical people, but with the yum,rpm,deb etc. package installers and the awesome and fast evolving KDE, GNOME and other Desktop Environment for Linux I am confident in a few years even nontechnical people will be able to use it.\r\n\r\nP.S.

There is such thing as a \"universal\" art?  Both viewpoints go straight to all that I dislike about mass culture.  Phenomenology recognizes the experience of performance...and the popular music example mentioned earlier is a fine one.  Also - the 15th Century example assumes that there is a direction/progression/advancement in art.  Certainly not.  If so, art history would be directional - toward an ever more representational style, or toward ever greater complexity.  But after the 15th Century we saw developments like Primitivism and Impressionism.  Art does not = representationism, or technical ability, etc.  \r\n\r\nBack to popular music - if technical proficiency were the sole determinant of \"good\", why a resurgence in music like the White Stripes?  Or the extremely rhythmically free Funk?  I know that Graham isn't arguing solely on technical ability.  \r\n\r\nThe instant an artist begins worrying about appealing to an audience s/he begins down the path of craft and not art.\r\n\r\nThat's just my tasteful opinion.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165956586,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25598-fd127b8b-b096-4f88-87a4-e5bc3e49f4a9-1566236767"}

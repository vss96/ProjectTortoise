At night, while you can't get the boots to go on it, you can still actually just walk onto the ice rink and \"skate\" around on normal shoes.\r\n\r\nLast night, fuelled by alcohol, a few friends and myself decided going on the ice rink would make a fun Christmas Eve...\r\n\r\n...We'd been on it no longer than 2 minutes when a voice boomed \"Please do not skate on the ice rink.\" and once we'd removed ourselves \"Merry Christmas!\". It was a CCTV speaker nearby and we were all pretty much freaked out by it.\r\n\r\nThat was the first time I'd heard them speak around here. \r\n\r\nThis is in [Warrington](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=warrington&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=12&amp;om=1), UK. We're not even that big a town so I didn't think we'd have things like this yet.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vz0p","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809351,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Xiol","id":"cvz4z","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vz0p","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49653-45b72186-b23c-40bf-99ad-411b067a07a5-1566236777"}

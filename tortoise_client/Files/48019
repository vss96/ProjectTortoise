Autogyro accidents are VERY common.  Autogyro blades are so much lighter than helicopter blades that if they are unloaded (as when you pull up sharply and reduce the relative wind through the blades), they decelerate enough to stop being a rotary wing.  Without a wing you drop, tumble, and the blades do not resume rotation before you hit the ground.  Autogyro accidents are a matter of time or great skill.  The autogyro pilot at my airfield is a 'Nam helo veteran and VERY skilled ... and he radiates a manic vibe if you look at his counter-rotating eyes - seriously.  \r\n\r\nDo not ever fly in an autogyro.  Parachuting is safer.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808606,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_uvyb","edited":false,"id":"cuw5u","author_flair_text":null,"author":"rfreytag","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30243-42816672-de96-4729-a7f4-4a947cdddab8-1566236769"}

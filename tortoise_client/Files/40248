Here is a quote you might find interesting.\r\n\r\n&gt; [Marvin] Odum [Shell's executive vice president of exploration and production in the Americas] said while the Gulf of Mexico will remain a key producing region of the world's biggest energy consumer, it was unclear if new discoveries could counter decline rates at existing fields.\r\n\r\n&gt; \"It's going to continue to be very important from a total output standpoint, whether there is real growth potential meaning to grow above volumes we have today or if it is just replacement volumes,\" the Shell official said.\r\n\r\nGiven that the Jack test well indicated an output of 6k barrels per day and that hundreds of billions of dollars and technical hurdles that haven't been defined, let alone surpassed, will be needed to fully develop those fields, I don't think you need to rush out and buy a Hummer.\r\n\r\nThe most compelling argument for Peak Oil, aside from Hibbert's curves, is the timing of the peak of discovery of new fields and the peak of production. For the US the peak in discovery occured in the 30's and the peak of production happened in 1970. The peak of world new reserve discovery happened in the 60's and the peak of production is happening basically right now. \r\n\r\nNext summer add another 30-40% to the price of gas from where it was last summer and apply the same recursion each summer thereafter.","retrieved_on":1473809654,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwemc","id":"cwf3y","author_flair_text":null,"author":"borg","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57988-ef417e67-ddf4-4165-b3a7-f0feee8277da-1566236780"}

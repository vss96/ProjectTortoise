{"body":"I think it depends on what you mean by \"productivity\" in \"tenfold improvement in productivity.\" If you mean to suggest in any way that the predictability of software projects can be improved by a silver bullet, then it is ridiculous to call IDE's a silver bullet.\r\n\r\nIf you mean only to say that we can get more assembly instructions generated correctly, then yes, IDE's are a silver bullet. But that's the same as saying that computers are a silver bullet with respect to typewriters. Of course it's true, but it's trivially true. Brooks definitely did mean to discuss the problem of why writing software is not like building a bridge. There don't seem to be any easy solutions to that problem, definitely not IDE's. \r\n\r\nOn balance, I tend to suspect that Wes Moise is just plain out of his mind. He has been working on one or several software projects that are vast in scope, entirely by himself, and has been claiming that they will all revolutionize the world. He's claimed that NStatic was within a few weeks of release at least three or four times. I don't think I can take him very seriously until he actually shows us something.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_tzjg","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165539733,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mcfunley","edited":false,"id":"cu237","parent_id":"t3_tzjg","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808043,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15002-732413a0-3b38-41b1-a7a4-924da36520af-1566236762"}

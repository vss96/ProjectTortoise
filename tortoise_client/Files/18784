I got invited to church with his family the first weekend after I was hired. One of the big mega-churches, seats 5000+. Looks like a concert stadium more than what you'd think a church would be.

Jeebus's words are being twisted in some circles to justify being rich. And he certainly does seem to enjoy money.\r\n\r\nI happen to know he's \"anti-evolution\". I would guess he also believes in a 6000 yr old earth.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wkal","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809752,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwkg0","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwkej","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60586-258fe658-708f-4895-8185-1a5815f11a46-1566236780"}

I'm sure interested people will account for this.\r\n\r\nYeah, I'm over it -- and appreciate the fact that you mentioned the edit.\r\n\r\n&gt; Treating your fellow humans as property (chattel slavery) is an extention of someone's principles too.\r\n\r\nThat has absolutely nothing to do with what I said, but thank you for attempting to associate something I said, completely unrelated to slavery, to a despicable practice as an attempt to distract from actual logical discourse.\r\n\r\n&gt; Maybe these \"principles\" you mention are in fact appeals to authority.\r\n\r\nNo, jackass, they're principles.  Appeals to authority would include crap like your Mark Twain quote.\r\n\r\n&gt; The free rider problem predicts that market economies underproduce these goods despite clear demand.\r\n\r\nI wonder why you think the \"free rider\" problem applies only to market economies.  Maybe you don't know jack about the subject.  I've heard it said that one should assume ignorance or stupidity before malicious intent.  In fact, I think Mark Twain said something about that.\r\n\r\n&gt; Fulfilling this reasonable demand is a \"bad business model\", as you say.\r\n\r\nPoppycock -- and without any backing evidence or logical support, \"poppycock\" is all your positive assertion requires as refutation.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25779-9cde1327-12aa-40fa-ae4a-cabd7f79a535-1566236767"}

I remember looking at PostgreSQL some time back and seeing the \"don't use on Windows, uses Cygwin\" stuff.  Clients didn't like the idea of changing their Windows server investment just to support a database.  Here was a huge feature in those release notes:\r\n\r\n&gt; * Add native LDAP authentication (Magnus Hagander)\r\n\r\n&gt;This is particularly useful for platforms that do not support PAM, such as Win32. \r\n\r\nSo now I can plug it in to ActiveDirectory.  Nice.  Nothing is more maddening than having to support Oracle and AD authentication everywhere.","link_id":"t3_tvsa","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807945,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"sbrown123","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tvsa","id":"ctwuk","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12746-cb698388-473f-4f47-9548-c4191fdb8157-1566236762"}

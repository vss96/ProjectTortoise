My personal philosohpy is that no matter what web framework you are using, it's going to piss you off, because lets face it: web programming sucks.  Its just a matter of trying to make it suck less.\r\n\r\nI ended up creating my own framework because I think a lot of solutions out there are worse than the diseases they are trying to cure (e.g. most ORMs), and because once you start doing anything complicated a lot of the existing framework's hocus-pocus time-saving magic will bite you in the ass unless you *really know how it works* ... almost to the point where you might as well have written it yourself :(","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0ju","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809395,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"advesperascit","id":"cw1hl","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w0ju","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50864-2a8217c5-3b88-43aa-9b19-b4496e70e1bc-1566236778"}

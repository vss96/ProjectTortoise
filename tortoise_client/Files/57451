This however is an issue for the judicial system and has no linkage whatsoever to the question of how\r\nto deal with those who are in fact quite guilty and quite \r\ndangerous.  \r\n\r\nThe problem with the video, the reason I downmodded it, is that it provides you with only one side of the story.  Watching people being forced to strip and then told to crawl looks demeaning and cruel on the one hand.  Overt \r\nphysical behavior and intimidation tends to draw empathy towards the person experiencing it.  On the other hand when one takes a more realistic look at the matter these are also\r\nvery effective means of allowing a smaller numbers of guards to control a much larger population of prisoners and this matter cannot be easily overlooked.\r\n\r\nPrison can only realistically be seen as punitive.  That flies in the face of a lot of liberal notions but society has the right to punish those who act against.  Not only do they have the right but they have the obligation to do so.\r\nWe can quibble all day long about what constitutes resaonable punishment.  In fact we'd probably agree that drug laws are fucking ridiculous but they are reality and have to be dealt with as such.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165788843,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cucr3","id":"cud3d","author_flair_text":null,"author":"decklap","retrieved_on":1473808249,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20885-ff6b8a90-e934-420d-8c20-c3799ff4268d-1566236765"}

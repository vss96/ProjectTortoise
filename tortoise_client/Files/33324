The point is that I can only play them in an Apple designed player, and I can only copy the songs to a limited number of devices, and I can only use the Apple software to make the transfers.  Pirated music has no such limitations. (btw, I own a powerbook and use iTunes almost exclusivly, and have bought music through the store, but this doesn't change the fact that the free music has fewer limitations than the paid-for music).","controversiality":0,"ups":12,"score":12,"created_utc":1165944910,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25170-5a950038-6f22-40b5-a97b-85cdab61482a-1566236767"}

You can easily write your own WSGI components, because the protocol is simple.\r\n2. You have the pluggable ease-of-use of any other WSGI component. No framework necessary.\r\n\r\nEven if you don't like the plethora of frameworks, there are plenty of good components available now that you can mix and match from to get all the boilerplate code -- object persistence, templating, etc. -- out of the way quickly. Check out Joe Gregorio's [\"Why so many Pyhon web frameworks?\"](http://bitworking.org/news/Why_so_many_Python_web_frameworks) for an example of just how easy that can be.\r\n\r\nAnd don't be afraid to ask questions; there are lots of friendly people who'll be happy to help you track down useful libraries and components no matter where you go.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0co","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1167089689,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":12,"score":12,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50261-cd2c45c7-267a-4d76-a7b6-8892c1bb8354-1566236778"}

There is this duality to American culture. Parts of it are bland and boring like, the parts malconent refers to [http://reddit.com/info/tap4/comments/ctbtm here]. On the other hand, the inclusiveness of America (contrast that with, say, France), or the ability of her constituents to listen to/make criticisms of the country (grandfather poster not withstanding) while staying patriotic inspire awe. The other countries that I have known closely (all in Asia) are almost incapable of self criticism. It is almost like self criticism is considered the opposite of patriotism. And it is so ingrained in the culture that I find myself doing that (reacting to criticism of the country negatively) as a reflex action sometimes, till I stop myself.\r\n\r\nI say this as someone born elsewhere but living in the US for the past 3 years and change.\r\n\r\nEdit: Uhh what?...Rap music is bland? I disclaim all support of malcontent's comment. Hell I even like pizza and some of what Hollywood dishes out.","controversiality":0,"ups":7,"score":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165077440,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3351-6a75c01d-86a7-464c-ab0e-5b162bf3f3b5-1566236759"}

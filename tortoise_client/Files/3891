Just let your mind wander.  Past ones include collaborative editing software (a la [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/)) that works over the web, a web-based doodleboard (a la [Thinkature](http://thinkature.com/)), a platform for creating social networking sites (a la [Ning](http://www.ning.com/)), a website that gives you *random* news from across the web (nobody's taken that one yet), a meta-social-networking site that condenses all your social-networking memberships into one easy-to-read place (to my knowledge, nobody's taken this one), and a meta-social-news site that tracks all the Digg/Reddit clones and runs some analyses on which sites exhibit which cultural biases (also untaken, to my knowledge).\r\n\r\n(Note that I'm not shy about sharing ideas: I figure that most of them are crap anyways, and I can always have more.  Plus, this way I have people *tell* me which are crap, which may spur better ideas.  The most useless feedback is when people smile and nod and say \"Oh, that sounds interesting\" when you can tell from their voice that it's really not.)\r\n\r\n*Good* ideas are a different matter.  It's interesting that about half my ideas over the past 2 years have actually been done by someone else, and none have really taken off.  Meanwhile, the really big successes - Digg/Reddit, YouTube - are stuff that I never would've thought of.  \r\n\r\nI'm working for a profitable startup now though, and I've had a string of internships, volunteer work, and tangential associations with various other startups.  So a few observations I've noted about successful startups:\r\n\r\n1. Solve a problem that's personally bugging *you*, not something that looks cool.  Reddit was apparently founded because Steve &amp; Alexis wanted more news.  LiveJournal was found because Brad Fitzpatrick wanted to stay in touch with his college friends.  Meanwhile, the hot-buzz-of-the-moment startups rarely have staying power.  I have doubts as to whether MySpace/TheFaceBook will be around in 5 years.\r\n2. Look at how people actually do their *jobs*.  Not their play, their jobs.  The best way to make money is to help other people make money.  Microsoft is very good at making third-party developers rich.  Google is very good at making niche businesses rich.  My employer is very good at making hedge funds rich.  \r\n3. Study ordinary people, not people like you.  If you're contemplating a startup, chances are you're of above-average intelligence.  Most of the people you'll be selling to are not (though they'd like to think it...)   My boss made this mistake when first starting his company: we initially focused on the high-end algorithmic trading, because that's what he did beforehand, but that is really a tiny, tiny slice of the financial sector.  Much of the money is in old-fashioned fundamental analysis, where hedge fund managers go out, talk to people at factories, examine how much of a product is selling, and try to forecast future earnings without any fancy-schmancy math.\r\n4. Don't ignore the mundane.  The most successful project I've been involved in is [FictionAlley](http://www.fictionalley.org/), where we are, alas, prohibited from making money by copyright laws.  However, there are millions of teenage and twenty-something girls that are into Harry Potter: in 5 years, the site has grown from a few dozen members to over 100,000, nearly Reddit-sized.  This also comes back to point #1, since the site was started because existing HP Fanfiction archives were horribly unreliable and kept cutting features (ironically, we're sort of in the same boat now, and people are leaving us for other archives).\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34159-6003e27c-90e3-4f84-b92d-27dedfbffd44-1566236771"}

{"body":"Would you care to expand on *\"Society is a system of class antagonisms...\"*? Rather than a conspiracy to keep the working class down, could it be just that a) the poor do not have the means to defend themselves as well as the rich; b) the poor do not have the same connections to defend themselves as well as the rich and, most importantly; c) *society does not care if a poor kid goes to jail*. Sad, but true - and true whether black or white. Thus: there is no one out to get you, Mr Jillian, nor is there a global, meticulous conspiracy to ensure the working class remains in  thrall. Rather (and quite conversely) there is but an *apathy* toward those who bring nothing to the economic table.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vi96","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166646750,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"plutocrat","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvjgf","parent_id":"t1_cvj3e","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809051,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41695-19b0be51-fc11-44e6-998e-c937d3fee8e0-1566236774"}

In order to get married in the church, you have to take a test that IIRC is about 100 yes/maybe/no questions ranging from things like \"I worry about my future spouse's spending habits\" to \"Sometimes I am afraid of my future spouse.\"  You then sit down and discuss places you differ or what you meant by certain answers with your future spouse and the priest who acts as a sort of counselor.\r\n\r\nAt the very least the whole process ensures that you have at least talked about or thought about certain key issues.

Most people don't last long. If they do, their chances for major injury rise dramatically. These plants are dangerous places to work. \r\n\r\nPeople that work in meatpacking often lose limbs, or suffer life long injuries. The pay is usually about $10/hour to slaughter animals in dangerous conditions. \r\n\r\nyes, it's a fortune for immigrants (illegal or not). But, by American standards, this is not a living wage if you are trying to support a family. \r\n\r\nAlso, we must question how so many illegals get jobs in meat packing. It's a problem in ALL meatpacking plants across America. Could it be that these companies are complicit in hiring illegals, or are they ALL getting duped by these non-english speaking illegals? \r\n\r\nHmmm... makes one wonder.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809168,"gilded":0,"id":"cvpgz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vpcj","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44748-9d5e447d-8c50-42c4-9711-e11a8693aa3b-1566236774"}

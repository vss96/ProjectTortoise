{"controversiality":1,"body":"&gt;You are being disingenuous. The New York Times spread false information, which got picked up by the media, and spread all around the world. Yet you deny the effect they had, and refuse to believe the lies got spread.\r\n\r\nYou are refusing to answer the main thrust of my question, which is: did prepared remarks attributed to David Duke that denied the existence of gas chambers get released by the Iranian foreign ministry, or not?\r\n\r\nEvery article you point to (and there are precious few of them, far from a worldwide conspiracy of any sort) says that the Times \"reported that Duke, a white supremacist, was expected to claim that Germany built no gas chambers or extermination camps during World War II\".\r\n\r\nI see two main possibilities here:\r\n\r\n1) The Iranian foreign ministry did indeed release a statement or prepared remarks that said Duke's address would include denials of the existence of gas chambers.  If that is true, then it's not the Times that smeared Duke, it's the Iranian foreign ministry.\r\n\r\n2) The Times made up the entire thing.\r\n\r\nYou have not provided a shred of evidence to support 2).","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v38q","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166374689,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"author":"adrian","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv4cr","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv4ab","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808762,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34019-2194fac4-97d8-436f-b007-b49d501edcfe-1566236771"}

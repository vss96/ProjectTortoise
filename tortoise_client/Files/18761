Whether that's worthwhile outside the U.S. depends on how much of their business they do outside the U.S.  Microsoft stock, in theory, should actually *rise* if the dollar drops, because they pay most of their employees in dollars but get a significant fraction of their revenues in RMB and other foreign currencies.

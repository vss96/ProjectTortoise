(They have to be larger families to make up for the time gap--two populations which each have an average of 3 children per woman grow at different rates, if they have different average ages at childbirth.)\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, correlated factors could have a larger effect than the direct impact of abortion itself.  As an example, pro-life might be correlated with larger families, while pro-choice might be correlated with the ability to support larger populations in the long run.  Either one of those factors might vastly overshadow the direct effect of abortion, and in which direction, I do not know.

So, he is not merely make the naive relativist claim that \"taste is subjective,\" but rather that there is something innate in human beings' perception (that is, \"in the very narrow sense of pleasing humans\") that allows those with enough aesthetic experience to form something like a community of taste in which arbiters can often agree on an aesthetic judgement.  I haven't read it in a while, but I recall that Kant equivocates on the matter of the aesthetic properties of the object itself--we can never know the noumenal aspects of an object, so can we ever make a claim about the true nature of the object in itself?  To argue that we can't have knowledge of the true nature of things and therefore can't make aesthetic judgements about them is the seed of naive relativism.  \r\n\r\nSo, yes, there is something in the object that is pleasing to humans.  I don't think many people would disagree with this.  After all, the object was selected by humans for aesthetic contemplation. \r\n\r\nWho is this essay intended for, BTW?  Is it an airing of thoughts and annoyance about naive relativism?  I guess my beef was more with the tone which came across to me as though  this essay is presenting a radical insight.  If it is meant as a blog entry about how naive relativism is naive and annoying, then I'm all behind it!\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808333,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuh8t","edited":false,"id":"cuhgl","author":"wselman","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23223-11b8d212-9df4-4a6f-a4f7-b5c020ca408d-1566236766"}

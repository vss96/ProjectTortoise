The launch of the PS3, XBox 360, and Wii parallels that of the PS2, XBox, and Gamecube fairly well, except that the roles of the PlayStation and XBox are transposed (XBox launched first, cheaper, with inferior technology)\r\n\r\nThe difference is the continuing entrenchment of the PlayStation franchise, combined with superior technology.\r\n\r\nThe PlayStation 3 will have value-added as a cheap Blu-Ray player, as well.\r\n\r\nXBox 360 is doomed, and Wii is in a market of its own, much like the Gamecube.  The only real battle to be fought is between the PS3 and the XBox 360, as the Wii, much like the Gamecube, will sit alongside one of these two consoles, but likely not both.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52578-600eef15-77a9-4588-b079-24d0d0277a0c-1566236778"}

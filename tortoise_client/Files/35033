You can be better off selling it yourself and saving that 6%.  And yes, you can sell at will, but sometimes (like now) that can take a long time (6+ months in some markets now)\r\n\r\n&gt; Everytime I've checked I've discovered that renters and homeowners end up about the same financially in the long run.\r\n\r\nI suspect that in the long run owners tend to come out ahead as they have something to show for the payments.  The question at this point is whether or not someone buying now will come out ahead in the short term (5 years).  We already know that people who bought in many markets in 2004 and 2005 are in the hole (they owe more than the house is worth if they tried to sell) and for them it's a question of how long they will stay in that hole.  \r\n\r\n...but long term (say 20 to 30 years) real estate has always been a good investment.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w2wq","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52418-5adffed7-7bac-4f31-8190-523ab0dea06c-1566236778"}

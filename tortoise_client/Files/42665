I started off with MySQL on Windows -- I needed something to stuff lots of data in and do proper SQL queries, not the brain-dead Access ones.  There was a relatively nice front-end and easy way of loading data, hence it worked for what I needed.  It's also sort of easy to hook it up with PHP -- and off you go.\r\n\r\nBut then, relatively short while after, I started running on various issues, like infamous 000-00-00 date, like no sub-selects, no functions or stored procedures (yeah, I know that some of these are sort of fixed now).\r\n\r\nAnd then I learned about ACS (R.I.P, aD) and it's OSS variety -- [OpenACS](http://openacs.org).  OACS is a Pg-land, forever was, forever will be.  I've never looked back since -- whenever I need a database in a given project, Postgres is my first choice.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tgj7","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"5968-ddafe652-cdfc-4c08-935d-19a503da6541-1566236760"}

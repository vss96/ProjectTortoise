The author spends lots of wordage talking about how China is becoming the U.S. banker and is buying up bonds...I can assure you if they thought we were in decline that wouldn't be happening.\r\n\r\nChina is facing social unrest, a male:female ratio of 2:1 (that'll bode well over the next couple of generations), an intentionally suppressed currency (they've have to let it float eventually and then, inflation here we come), and the lack of true (beyond sheer numbers) military strength to protect its foreign markets over the short term. This country, and this essay, are overstating the Chinese threat.\r\n\r\nAmerica does not need to manufacture its own goods. Our economy has evolved beyond that. Such a development is something new in the world, and so it is inevitable that critics should pass condemnation on it. But just because you see that every toy is manufactured in China, certainly does not speak to a declining American influence.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vct7","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808933,"distinguished":null,"author":"txmed","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvdds","parent_id":"t3_vct7","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38542-3b5936d1-296f-4400-8b5c-c5b8769e7285-1566236773"}

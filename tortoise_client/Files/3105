{"body":"&gt; Look: Religion starts with a form of child abuse. The brainwashing of innocent children with unsubstantiated information \r\n\r\nSo, are you saying that it's impossible to have religion unless it starts with the abuse of a child? If not, are you only against it in that one specific circumstance?\r\n\r\n&gt; In all religions there are priests of some sort or another who \"know more\" - know more previously told lies, and make up new ones.\r\n\r\nMany of the more exploitative religions are like this. Some of them that are less so, this is nothing like what they are. Are you only attacking those that are exploitative?\r\n\r\n&gt; Historically people were hungry, tired, poor and would grasp at anything someone would say about a \"better tomorrow\".\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Jesus himself, assuming he was a real person, and that he said most of what was attributed to him, seemed to try to tell people to do their part to feed the hungry.\r\n\r\n(I'm not altogether convinced that he was real, and even less so that if he was, he said anything quite like what is claimed)\r\n\r\n&gt; Priest exploited this weakness to the hilt. They created hell and damnation for those who didn't believe them - and created false promises of heaven for those who did... All this itself is bad enough. On top of this, they propagated hate based wars against other similarly stupid religious systems - nothing but a political power struggle.\r\n\r\nYou seem angry. Did a catholic priest molest you? Did the mormon elder take your highschool sweetheart as his third wife? What gives?\r\n\r\n&gt; So at best Religions give people a false sense of hope and security. At worst it kills people. Frankly I don't see and redeeming value at all.\r\n\r\nReligion kills people? I mean, I'd grant you that it deludes people, and harms them other ways. But when you generalize it so much that you only use the word \"religion\" to the point that it encompasses everything in that category bar none, it seems absurd.\r\n\r\nWhat about Buddhism? Does it get an exemption?","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx8t","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167010496,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","edited":false,"id":"cvyek","parent_id":"t1_cvyd5","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809337,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49247-d7f01196-8847-4d78-b272-760ad41bb124-1566236777"}

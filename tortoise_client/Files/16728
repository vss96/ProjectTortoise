From what I understood, even those that first came up with the consiousness thing weren't claiming it as a physics idea as much as vauge speculation.. (ie, of the \"quantum mechanics is weird, consiousness is weird, therefore maybe they're related\" type of speculation\") It just somehow stuck. As far as I know, it generally isn't accepted by physicists, nor, to the best of my knowledge (though here I may easily be wrong) had it ever been accepted by a majority of physicists except possibly in the very early days of QM when physicists were collectively experiencing a WTF in response to QM.\r\n\r\nWith recards to the thing you linked to, didn't finish going over it, but from a brief look, you may be interested in looking up the \"free will theorem\" (Conway, and maybe some others)\r\n\r\nEssentially they made more explicit this thing... Namely, if _anything_ has \"free will\", (say, humans) then the behavior of electrons must also.\r\n\r\nSo it does it in reverse, but essentially is a somewhat formalized argument in favor of the non-specialness of the human brain.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not sure about that last bit you mentioned, \"Or that those who rejected it preferred an aphysical view of \"physics\" that reduced it to mathematical masturbation?\"\r\n\r\nAgain, could you clarify that?

First, I work for a government contractor and we always have a requirement that all of our code be editable easily from a very basic command line editor such as ed, that way if the system goes down on a boat docked off of Japan or the Mid East, you can fly someone out there and have them make fixes with the lowliest of tools.  Second, I tend to move my software around between computers that all do not have the same tools.  The one thing I can rely on is that I have Emacs on all machines, so it's important that I be able to modify code outside of the GUI tool without problems.  Finally, and this is totally personal, I just feel better knowing that at any time I can get my hands dirty and touch the code.  I just don't like relinquishing that option.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_ujwh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165977344,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26230-54a97e76-87b8-457b-8b60-7c69f9012e14-1566236767"}

Often, the particle has later been observed in experiments.  For example, the [Top quark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark) was predicted well before it was discovered in 1995.  Is adding one more particle to the current 24 of the standard model really incredulous?\r\n\r\nSaying it's 'invisible' is kind of misleading, since it places an unnecessary and asymmetric importance on electromagnetism.  They are observ*able*, because they interact with the gravitational field.  In [some theories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP), they also interact with the weak force.  'Unobserved' would be a better description.\r\n\r\nIn the end, of course, either possibility involves the rewriting of some part of theoretical physics - either a relatively minor update to the standard model, or a complete, fundamental and ugly change to GR.","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166134467,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cutnr","parent_id":"t1_cut3z","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"acrophobia","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808559,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"29051-050c6756-e797-4c75-81d7-7ea80efc6853-1566236768"}

Incredibly bad decision, lucky the baby is still alive. This 23-year-old mother's parents obviously raised a child with serious issues and, apparently, no knowledge of birth control. (Ditto on the birth control to the 20-year-old father and his family.) And, apparently, no idea of what might happen to an infant left in a car for multiple days without, water, or temperature controls. It almost boggles the mind.\r\n\r\nAnd well done, family, friends, and church, for creating an environment so hostile to honesty that it almost cost a 6-week old infant his life. But I guess this is what happens when you follow a religion that condemns people to eternal damnation and hellfire for petty offences.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_truq","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12264-f9380b0c-2249-456b-902c-f0ba296c0754-1566236761"}

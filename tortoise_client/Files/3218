Is Earl on DVD yet? If not it was broadcast on public airwaves and is fair game until the company stands to lose money.\r\nIf it is on DVD, it's not legal.\r\n\r\nWhat an interesting concept.  I bet there are warnings about copyright infringement etc in the credits at the end of each episode.  \r\n\r\nIf a million people download those episodes this week and then they're released on DVD next week and no one buys them, I think the TV company would be justified in saying they'd lost money.  I think the official line in these sorts of cases is that if you deprive a legitimate business of income, they can throw the book at you.  That's why you can get in trouble even for something as seemingly inocuous as registering a domain name that's \"confusingly similar\" to that of a popular site like google or yahoo.","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1164990970,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1419-300aeb84-bbcb-4e8e-b953-77295679aa71-1566236758"}

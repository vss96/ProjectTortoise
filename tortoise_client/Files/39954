Basic consideration of supply and demand suggests the opposite.  Stuff will be more expensive as commodity supplies fall and the newly affluent in the developing world add to demand at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this has been the trend in the US since 1970.  The median wage purchases less stuff now than it did then.\r\n\r\nHow exactly is international travel going to get cheaper when oil supply is in decline?  How is a steak dinner going to get cheaper when cattle production is now maxed out, but a hundred million people in China are developing a greater taste for meat?\r\n\r\nYou're delusional if you think scarcity is going away.  Scarcity is worsening.","ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165610462,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cu5xj","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu5v7","author_flair_text":null,"author":"kkrev","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808115,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16931-ed8969ec-dd77-4862-b68c-728363a6f8c7-1566236763"}

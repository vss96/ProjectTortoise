Discuss string theory. Discuss the origin of the big bang.\r\n\r\nNone of this is relevant to the discussion at hand, although I happen to know several excellent physicists and astronomers if you're interested in signing up for a class.\r\n\r\n&gt; Now, if you honestly dont think Richard Dawkins is doing \r\n&gt; everything in his power to create an environment where a \r\n&gt; child is more likely to become an atheist, then you disagree\r\n&gt; with Dawkins himself! \"I could well imagine that this \r\n&gt; linguistically coded freedom to choose might lead children \r\n&gt; to choose no religion at all!\" --- now, is he stating this \r\n&gt; as a BAD thing? Of course not!\r\n\r\nI think that he's trying to level the playing field by not indoctrinating children with a particular set of beliefs until they have the ability to make critical decisions about religious and philosophical issues on their own, which, in my opinion, is entirely different than \"creating an environment where a child is more likely to become an atheist\".  Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.\r\n\r\n&gt; Further, there is NOTHING in my post that is \r\n&gt; 'starting with a premise, and then assuming it to \r\n&gt; be true' --- The ONLY thing in the above post is \r\n&gt; talking about Richard Dawkins' OWN VIEWS on religion \r\n&gt; among kids. \r\n\r\nThe premise ends with \"If so\".  By the way, I'm not denying that Richard Dawkins is a hypocrite; I haven't read enough of what he's written to decide either way.  All I'm saying is that the information you provided above isn't sufficient to reasonably demonstrate to me that his is, in fact, being hypocritical.\r\n\r\n&gt; How you can possibly construe that as a \r\n&gt; 'religious debate' is beyond me.\r\n\r\nMy mistake.  I was attempting to say that I see that particular pattern in religious debates, not claiming that this was a religious debate.  Sorry about that.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_ua04","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808355,"distinguished":null,"author":"pabs","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuikk","parent_id":"t1_cucwp","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23853-e1c1fdb2-0322-4a11-8de4-a58cec42dbd3-1566236767"}

This itself isn't a problem, but others like you say things that will drive a wedge between them and those they hope to persuade to be rational.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many excuses, if someone wants to commit what religion calls *sin*. Removing religion, even if it can be done, will do nothing to reduce the darkness in the heart and spirit of men.\r\n\r\nThere are many good reasons to denounce religion. There are quite a few bad ones too. Claiming that the world will somehow become a utopia where no one ever harms another (or even one where it happens less than it does now) is just plain stupid.\r\n\r\nThe sort of satire that the article is works well when someone wants to embarrass a politician who is a fool. It would work very poorly against a religious leader who is the same. But targeting religion itself, and generically at that, it does a disservice to its cause. I do not know how to help you see this, but it is more than obvious to myself.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx8t","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809328,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","id":"cvxxq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvxx2","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49020-6097c319-dfe6-45ae-a53c-5dbe58873dd7-1566236777"}

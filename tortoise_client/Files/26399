Thank you.  I really don't think mangleon's parent post (or his/her follow-ups) got this clarified to this point, and I thank you for that.\r\n\r\nHowever...\r\n\r\nCan you find me some posts that put Israel in a positive light?  Perhaps they'll have no votes at all - so I won't know how to find them - but I have to ask, do they really exist?  And I'm not being anti-semitic, here, I'm just telling you to prove your claim.  Let's get this done with, and done right.\r\n\r\nExcept, wait.  Would *that* even prove anything?  How many stories that are positive about the US get posted?  Maybe that's a better comparison.  # of upvotes for US-positive stories vs # of upvotes for Israel-positive stories.  Not being a statistician I'm having a hard time thinking of how to make meaningful data rise to the top.\r\n\r\n(edit: I suppose actually that we'd have to compare the above somehow with all the US-positive and Israel-positive stories available on the web.  Perhaps there aren't very many Israel-positive stories out there in general, and reddit simply reflects that bias.)\r\n\r\n(I actually didn't see that beaten-on-a-bus story.  Redditors blamed Israel?  Interesting.  Can you link to those comments for me?)","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42565-53233281-7bc7-48ab-93b3-f3aebdd86e00-1566236774"}

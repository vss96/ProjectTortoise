So not only is this a smaller issue because of the stronger growth in the US, but it will stabilize.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd love to point out that all those Asian banks and oil producers have lots of dollars because it is a stabilizing investment.\r\n\r\nCompared to holding Chinese assets, the dollar is much, much safer.\r\n\r\nThe unperforming loan of China, to me, are much more troublesome than, say, the level of deficit spending in the US. The long-term demographic obligations are a real problem.\r\nBut, in 2009, i think, China will open up consumer banking to foreign banks.\r\n\r\nLet's say you're a middle class person in China, and you know that many, many banks have unperforming loans (i.e. you don't expect them to be paid back).

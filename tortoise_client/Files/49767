Don't short the dollar, and don't buy gold coins. The easiest way to hedge against currency risk is to increase your exposure to foreign currencies in stable markets. IEV (Europe), EEM (Asia, less Japan), and ITF (Japan) are good bets. I wouldn't recommend Japan as highly as Asia less Japan and Europe. I'd avoid Latin America as those economies are all going socialist and are so heavily linked to US markets.\r\n\r\nIf you buy gold, you're betting global recession.

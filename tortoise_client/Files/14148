However, it seems that Bush was much more avowedly a bankrupt Christofascist and still got elected; he only is suffering in the polls today because people found that he was not only a Christofascist, but also a filthy liar. McCain, while making nice with the fanatics, has no appearance of being a filthy liar, and so should do at least as well as Bush in 00 and 04. We can only hope that his opponent in 08 will not be as inept as those in 00 or 04.","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166119180,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28378-0590f6a3-2b66-42c8-b084-5a660d89ccc2-1566236768"}

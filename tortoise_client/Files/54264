Biology can state that an organism's brain is no longer alive after death, but the nature of mind and consciousness is not necessarily in the domain of biology, and biology has as yet not shown a biological basis for consciousness.  While believers in reductionism (especially biological reductionists like Dennett or Dawkins) or scientism (who apparently make up many redditors) assume that mind == brain, philosophically the issue is far from obvious let alone settled.  Those like Dawkins who try to pretend that things are settled philosophically are just breeding a new dogmatism with a different set of brittle beliefs (please keep in mind that one can hold a true belief dogmatically).  A serious study of the underlying philosophical issues is not something that either side of the endless and vapid Religion vs. Science debate seems to engage in.\r\n\r\n\"The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.\"","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166471427,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36549-1ed615a4-5717-438b-ad17-917cc0ea9c2d-1566236772"}

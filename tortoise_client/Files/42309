This nicely captures the idea that if X earns twice as much as Y, then he will be twice as 'rich', even if they happen to have the same amount in the bank at a particular time.  It also takes into account things like compound interest paid to you from your current assets, and the effect of going to an expensive school and so on.\r\n\r\nNow, if it were the case that the ratio of current assets / future earnings was constant from person to person, then it would be OK to just look at current assets.  But in reality, this is completely not the case.  As I am currently in debt, &gt;101% of my net present value is in future earnings.  About 90% of my sisters NPV is in future earnings.  Around 5% of my parents NPV is in future earnings.\r\n\r\nSo it differs from person to person, but can we take averages over whole populations and hope that it evens itself out?  Well no, because people with high NPV *often* also have large amounts of current assets.  In fact, the article itself mentions that\r\n\r\n&gt; While global income is distributed unequally, the spread of wealth is *even more skewed*, the study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research of the U.N. University said.\r\n\r\nThis \"even more skewed\" means that the ratio of real wealth / apparent wealth is definitely not constant, so it is a very biased indicator of real wealth.  It would be one thing if it was the only proxy you have for estimating real wealth, but in fact there is a much better measure, GDP PPP.  This measures earnings and not assets, but since most people have most of their NPV in the form of future earnings, this makes sense.\r\n\r\nFinally, compound interest is *linearly* dependent on the starting amount.  If X starts with twice the money of Y, X will end up with twice the money of Y.  If compound interest were an important factor in getting (and being) rich, and given that most people have very little assets, then you would expect for virtually no one to break into that top 2%.  But look at the [current world rich list \\[pdf\\]](http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/pdfs/strlworld.pdf), Robson Walton inherited wealth, but Sam Walton was a farmer.  Bill Gates had rich parents, but he has orders of magnitude more than they did.  Warren Buffett the same.  Karl Albrecht was \"[raised in modest circumstances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Albrecht)\".  I'm not claiming that having wealthy parents doesn't help, but I am saying that it is not the money itself that does it.","link_id":"t3_tour","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165343542,"score":0,"ups":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9495-9bba6eea-ffb3-4f8f-a131-4913821f6d57-1566236761"}

Community Oriented Policing is essentially dead in most urban areas as a result of drug interdiction policy and police misconduct stemming in large part from the \"us vs. them\" attitude the drug war has created.\r\n\r\nThose same policies have created an environment where local governments are willing to allow the use of military organizational models in the interests of promoting officer survivability.  This seems an acceptable goal but in practice it pushes community relations to the point where community oriented policing and public support for police initiatives fail.  This results in a more dangerous environment for everyone and prompts even more anti-social behavior on the part of police officers.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wjwi","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809762,"author":"thevalarauk","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwkz5","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwkuw","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60926-4957244d-6585-4ba8-ba9f-970d03f7ab88-1566236780"}

Sorry, I should have written that more clearly.\r\n\r\nI really think DA5lD is right when he says these guys are \"ostracized like no other group\".  It seems that even applies to people accused of raping someone, who are eventually found \"innocent\" or acquitted.\r\n\r\nFor instance, what do you think the future prospects of the Duke Lacross Team's students are?  What is the first thing that pops into your head when somebody says the name \"Kobe Bryant\"?  Both of these cases resulted in the case being thrown out, or verdicts of not guilty.  There are many more examples\r\n\r\nThe level of gender discrimination is off the charts.  That is the other thing I was trying to demonstrate with my comment (with a little bit of hyperbole thrown in for good measure, I might add... :P)\r\n\r\nPeople need to take responsibility for their actions, and that includes women who *choose* to get drunk, then make stupid decisions as a result.  I'm tired of all these cases of questionable \"consensual sex\" falling squarely on the man's shoulders.\r\n\r\nNotice how even the article's slant points the finger directly at men, and uses women as the victim.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wa4w","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167346082,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55744-8e56adbc-d77c-49e1-9202-3c81a58b6906-1566236779"}

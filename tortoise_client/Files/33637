Having finished college and working full time now, all I could ever want at this point is a total lack of bills. And, preferably, by my own means. Which is to say, I want to be able to afford my simple life. My family insists on mindless gift-sharing. And to quote my mom concerning a gift for my older brother, \"I just HAVE to get him something\" (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n'Consumer Apathy' is the name of the game here, as it was pointed out below by sketerpot. It's not that I don't want anything, but there is just nothing I have seen that I crave. And I would wager it's not entirely uncommon.","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37657-901d7d6f-5448-41d3-b9dd-0c1a7e817943-1566236772"}

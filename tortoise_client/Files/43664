Further the human behavioral assumptions upon which economics are built (Jane has money, Jane is hungry, Jane sees food, Jane buys food) are quite different than those in philosophy and government (Jane sits down in a cafe with friends and debates whether or not free will exists and whether or not--and then how--free will should be implemented in government. She then arrives at this conclusion...). I think its clear that there is a little bit more room for \"opinion jamming\" in the latter in comparison to the former.\r\n\r\nAll this is not to say that economics aren't debatable, clearly they are. Just to a lesser extent than other social sciences.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166632473,"ups":1,"score":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvi7a","parent_id":"t1_cvi4h","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","retrieved_on":1473809028,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41071-d74f204d-9135-4f98-a441-6083853b4dab-1566236773"}

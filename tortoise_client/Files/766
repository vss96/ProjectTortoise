I'm constantly coming across links that don't allow users to view the content unless they pay. This happens quite often dealing with academic papers or standards organizations, as well as certain magazine sites, like www.sqlmag.com. I did a search a week or two ago where nine out of the top ten results were inaccessible to me unless I paid some large sum of money. And 8 results on the second page were inaccessible. For many of my search queries, sqlmag.com is the number one result. It's quite frustrating to have such \"spam\" on the top of the google results. And since it is forbidden (sending different content to google spiders than normal users), Google should take care of this issue.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165509358,"ups":7,"score":7,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctzss","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctzd7","author":"theram4","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808000,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13981-14abc1e9-73dc-4c28-9486-add8f1bfba9d-1566236762"}

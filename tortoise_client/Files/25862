Why is it such a general scientific assumption that animals are unable to communicate/think that it \"stuns\" scientists?  That is more remarkable than a talking parrot.  Seriously, do you think all of a sudden monkeys achieved \"sapien\" status and just discovered language?  Have you heard birds squawking at eachother?  Do you just think they are mechanically emitting mindless noises?  Give me a break.  I have seen so many studies grasping for the conclusion that human language is somehow unique it seems like some kind of neurosis/paranoia.  Why are people threatened by the idea that animals have minds?  When humans finally let go of this arrogant assumption about how special we are, the world will be a much better place.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53523-71883d0b-d946-4a29-aed8-0739e8397627-1566236778"}

{"body":"I don't know enough Haskell yet.  However, I couldn't help but think Karsten was talking the wrong approach to trying to fix giveElements and detectElement.\r\n\r\nLet's say we don't need the tracing, which is fixed by Debug.Trace anyway.  Let's say that 'condition' does need some outside state for some other purpose, like more sophisticated decision criteria.\r\n\r\nInstead of having giveElements and detectElement also deal with state, it would be better to create a new pure version of 'condition' based on that outside state, and pass that to the giveElements.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense, or am I going in the wrong direction?","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w79v","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1167274481,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":10,"ups":10,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ansible","id":"cw7mw","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw7hz","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809513,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54214-3bb9da23-7f50-4ed9-b37c-eb4a5c542753-1566236779"}

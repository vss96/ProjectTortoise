{"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uhet","body":"Interesting article, but it really isn't Econ 101, in Economics 101 you learn that there is not a finite set amount of cash available to be doled out, wealth can be created (and destroyed) without taking it from one person and giving it to another.\r\n\r\nSecond, I think the benefit of this base of good free tools outweighs the loss of potential revenue. A large percentage open source software is developer focused, partly because that's who's writing it and also because it's what makes the most sense to open source.\r\n\r\nThis Plumware 5.0 example is a red herring. Let's say I'm a web developer and i decide to open source my web framework, I (hopefully) get more eyes looking at my code and maybe contributing and the framework gets better. I'm not a framework salesman, so i lose no real income and get benefit.\r\n\r\nWhy on earth would I develop an application for plumbers, if i'm not a plumber who's going to use it? Are there really open source programmers out there who are working in a problem domain that does not affect them at all?\r\n\r\nOpen source is not about picking a product at random, implementing it and then giving it away like a charity. It's about a community pooling resources and jointly solving a problem and sharing the benefit and, maybe, guaranteeing that future work on top of the community developed solution is shared as well.","controversiality":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1165873922,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uhet","id":"cuhmt","author":"freshhawk","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808335,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23309-297bf4ff-7252-4ba1-b356-32043e20663d-1566236766"}

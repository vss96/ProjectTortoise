The show brings in new idiots every week to eat a turd while surrounded by people in lifesize animal outfits.  A panel of people, which includes several \"actresses\" who have blue hair, will show up in the bottom right of the screen to show their reaction as the contestant eats a turd.  The host for the show always appear to be mad at something and yells angrily at no one in particular.\r\n\r\nActually I made the show up, but it's plausible.  Those people have been trapped on that island for too long.

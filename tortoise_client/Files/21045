The original statement is approximately \"As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.\"  There's no implication that when it finally comes it invalidates the whole discussion, that's something you've added.\r\n\r\nI could see your point if it was UFOs, maybe, but what if you're talking about Pol Pot, Stalin or Mao?   Why is a comparison to Hitler necessarily invalid, just because it's clich√©?  I think what you mean is more like \"if I don't agree with something and it mentions Hitler, I can disregard it completely.\"  Even if you don't agree with the article's point of view, I don't think the Hitler reference is nearly so ridiculous as they sometimes are, and it doesn't make the authors criticism of Will any less valid.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14570-f7ee4db5-f515-4852-bf29-75191c6ae3b1-1566236762"}

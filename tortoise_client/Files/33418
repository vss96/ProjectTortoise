{"body":"My only answer is a pretty stupid one: the Constitution doesn't say habeas corpus or due process is reserved only for citizens.\r\n\r\nFor example, Amendment V reads, \"nor shall any _person_ [emphasis added]...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....\"\r\n\r\nArticle I, Section 9, Clause 2 reads, \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" I suppose it is up to a court or a legal scholar to say to whom the privilege of the Great Writ is normally due, but I have no conception that foreigners aren't afforded it as well.\r\n\r\nAt least, resident aliens are, as well as illegal immigrants. Foreigners having never set foot on American soil (such as are many Guantanamo detainees) might conceivably be classed differently. This is complicated by the Constitution, Article I Section 8 Clause 10, which gives Congress the power to \"define and punish...Offences against the Law of Nations.\" However, if Congress has not bothered to define what these people have done, nor proved it in a court of law, I can't see any legal basis for indefinite detention.\r\n\r\nOf course, IAMNAL.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vcii","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166898949,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"adoarns","id":"cvv0p","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvfph","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809272,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47554-5d7ca239-fc11-48eb-8dbc-6356749cc3eb-1566236775"}

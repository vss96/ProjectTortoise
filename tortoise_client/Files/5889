They need to take a hard-line approach to firearms, but it's not like this kid was a threat.  But, what happens if some other kid down the road gets caught with a firearm only to turn around and say, \"I was just going to turn it into a teacher/principle?\"  When I was in school we were always taught that if we found a weapon we were NOT to touch it and then go find an adult.  I feel bad for the kid if he was, in fact, only trying to do right but he was in posession of the firearm and, regardless of intent, posession of a firearm is clearly against the rules, and for good reason.  Good intent, bad decision?","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30345-92655bd6-d465-4121-a8e4-a52925ab0986-1566236769"}

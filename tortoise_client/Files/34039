Maybe 10% of them are candidates for running Linux on everything, specifically because they have some vertical market app like Dentrix (for dentists), Timberline (for property management), Amicus (for attorneys).  The list is truly endless.  And very few will support a linux server.  That is really a dealbreaker for these customers.\r\n\r\nYou can call me an M$ lackey if you wish, but for me, its where the business is at.  If everyone was clamoring for linux and openoffice, I'd shift to that.\r\n\r\nAlso, this scenario that the article is describing happened to me in 2002!  That's when I and others in my business learned of the three builds.  People who are just now learning this really have no business charging customers, IMO.","link_id":"t3_wjvh","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809755,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwkk4","parent_id":"t1_cwkgm","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60648-88d13ce0-2184-40a7-b722-173b75d87f81-1566236780"}

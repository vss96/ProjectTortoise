{"body":"\"the mongolian idiot\" ... That's one funny expression inadvertently invented right there. That has to become either a reddit meme or a book title (spy thriller in a political setting. Poorly written and quite boring, but sells alot of copies due to the clever title). Possibly both.\r\n\r\nWhat should it mean? Someone who's \"not from 'here', and also happens to be stupid\"? Or maybe it was some famous historical person from Mongolia. A religious fundamendalist? A wrestling move? A drink or a sandwich?\r\n\r\nI sense a wikipedia entry taking shape.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tq6l","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165356754,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"dln","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctr7a","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctqxt","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807841,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10018-e90a10d8-9f9c-4154-8601-f8d15fc23e6b-1566236761"}

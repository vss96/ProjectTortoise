(milk that ignorant fear for all it's worth)\r\n\r\nIf the presidents are lying about it then there IS NO evidence. I just don't see how anybody smart enough to become president (Dubyah excluded) can believe in such drivel (although Nancy (and prolly Ronnie) Reagan brought in psychics according to some reports (no, I'm not going to provide a link -- look it up yourself)\r\n\r\nLet's not sink to name-calling -- my last caution on that. I'm saying *Once Again* The little girl is an actress and if you have a problem with that, you should take it up with her parents and perhaps try to change child-labor laws. If a church wants to hire a kid to help get a new church building or increase the pastor's salary, I really don't care, unless the kid doesn't want to be an actress -- but even then, it's between the C.L. laws, the kid and her parents.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165791792,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cud7n","id":"cud96","author_flair_text":null,"author":"DA5lD","retrieved_on":1473808252,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20976-61878163-b4ca-42e3-be1b-dc3954efd95f-1566236765"}

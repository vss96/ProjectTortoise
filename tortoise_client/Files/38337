The newer 2x and 4x MD's had horrible DRM.  You had to re-encode all your MP3's as Sony proprietary audio format and they were not-transferable between computers.  If you reformat your HD, you would have to re-encode all your audio.  Sony is too anal about DRM.  If the MD worked with MP3's then it would have been a great music player.\r\n\r\nI have a Sharp MD player (MS702) and while I never use it anymore, it is still the best sounding portable music device I own.  Better than all the newer MP3 players.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ujny","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808404,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"kermityfrog","id":"culak","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuklm","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25128-ed633886-d3d6-4ca4-9340-d67448224a8d-1566236767"}

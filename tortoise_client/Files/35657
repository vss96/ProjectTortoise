They are profoundly authoritarian. They also succumbed to the natural corruption that comes from too much power for too long a time.\r\n\r\nGiving handouts to big campaign contributors who happen to be companies has nothing at all to do with a belief in capitalism.\r\n\r\nI'm a libertarian who has occasionally voted Republican (but usually I just vote Libertarian). Until 2 years ago I had never voted for a Democrat. I've been so horrified by events over the last 4 years that I voted straight Democrat at the federal level in the most recent election. I didn't care who the Democrat was because this was a party line vote. I wanted Republicans out of power and I didn't care who got in to replace them.\r\n\r\nRepublicans have fucked up royally in so many ways that it's hard to believe they haven't been doing it on purpose.\r\n\r\nI was overjoyed to hear that Democrats are removing all earmarks from next year's congressional budget. I know this is probably a one time thing, but if the Democrats continue doing that sort of thing then they'll win over a lot of libertarians like me.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48157-54e74a00-3c00-492e-87d6-f19892c03c10-1566236777"}

First, I initially assumed you meant in-place reverse, but that's easily fixed by adding the line:\r\n\r\n      s = strdup(s);\r\n\r\n... at the beginning, so it's no biggie.  Second, I put the /2 in the initial definition of len, and then got confused as to why it was only reversing half the string!  That's just careless, but easily fixed.  And finally, I used \"for(int i ...\" because I was thinking in C++ instead of C.\r\n\r\nOh, and I did a test harness that included \"s = StrReverse(NULL)\" and got terribly confused at the segfault until I realised that strlen can't handle nulls, which is why I put in the \"... ? ... : ...\" condition.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17300-ac58a3b0-1c60-4e25-8b65-ad6094763ed2-1566236763"}

Suffice it to say that Sardar's(?) world is one that Orwell would have taken a puckish delight in ripping apart--a world in which TalibanLand becomes the cynosure of \"human rights and equality\" (sic)--[horrors!A dastardly \"American\" concept (All men/women are created equal)]...and that swamp of beheadings and anti-semitism/anti-Christ, Saudi Arabia, becomes a Brave New World of love and caritas. Of course, guilt-ridden Britain needs to prove its \"tolerance\" by appointing the likes of Sardar to its human rights bodies.Much like giving the late and unlamented Lord Haw Haw a real lordship. Today, he'd be Hitler's rep to the New (Judenrein) Britain.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165680225,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18511-f89d8458-6f77-4bf7-8a8a-6cfa21d5d9f5-1566236764"}

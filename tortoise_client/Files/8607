I've never been able to read a word a doctor has ever written (and I'm not illiterate as you can see!). It's not that they can't write, though, and I don't think these \"penmanship\" classes are going to do any good. They learned to write a long time ago and I assume they were reasonably good at it or else they'd never have gained their degree(s).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that doctors have to write a lot, and often writing similar things over and over - they get to a state where they are so good at writing that they have optimised the alphabet to the point where anything can be written by a simple flick of the wrist.\r\n\r\nMy solution: Use a computer, not a pen. If handwriting is really putting lives at stake I think we should be playing it safe.

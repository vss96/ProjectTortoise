When determining what nuclear armed nation is the world's most \"dangerous\", it is helpful to consider who the danger is toward: for example, do Iranians have more of a reason to fear the United States than Americans have a reason to fear Pakistan?  Obviously, if you are an American, you fear the US's nuclear arsenal less than other people.\r\n* The United States is the world's most powerful nation (or so we're told) and thus its actions set an example for the rest of the world.\r\n* The United States has the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons (with the possible exception of Russia).\r\n* As the the documentary linked to above makes clear, the United States is the only nation to have used nuclear weapons against people (notably, civilians).\r\n* Lastly, the number of Russians, French, Chinese, Indians, Pakistanis, North Koreans, and Israelis reading this thread is surely less than the number of Americans reading it, so speaking to the issue of American nuclear weapons here makes more sense than talking about, say, North Korea's nukes.  Americans have a responsibility to pressure their government to get rid of its nuclear weapons.  I have a responsibility to pressure Americans to pressure their government.  Hence, these remarks.\r\n\r\nThe other people likely reading this thread who hail from a nuclear-armed country are Britons.  Tony Blair has justified spending up to 20 billion pounds on a new generation of nuclear weapons-carrying submarines because in his mind, it's uncertain if new nuclear threats will emerge in the future.  Tell Tony to change his mind.","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_w26w","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52934-19aa4171-731a-4c1a-9d11-f138d27c5145-1566236778"}

Explicitly belaboring that point was saying to her \"oh boy, wait until your bosses, the press, various civil rights groups hear about this. I just met a bigot working for a large corporation, i'm getting my 15 minutes and some cash!\" and the purser responded poorly, trying to cover up the mistake the stewardess made and then things get out of hand as pilot napoleon decides that everyone is going to shut up and the problem will go away.\r\n\r\nHey purser, next time just say \"don't worry about it sir, i'll take care of it and it will not happen again\" and let the tone of your voice tell them that texas hair bitch is going to get in some trouble over this.\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165001651,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ct9ne","parent_id":"t1_ct990","author_flair_text":null,"author":"freshhawk","retrieved_on":1473807510,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1904-cfffb4a0-e8d5-4f30-bedf-d5650607a216-1566236758"}

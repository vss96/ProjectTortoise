Surely if I were to build this from the ground up I'd have used the open source library instead of my custom hack, I'd SSH files to an external server for backup instead of having to burn DVDs once a week, I'd have built a web interface to turn the service on and off instead of requiring a command line login, I'd have used an all Windows or all Linux environment instead of using a bunch of workarounds to use one O.S. dependent software tool with another O.S. dependent database, etc\r\n\r\nIn the end though, the system can still work even if, by all appearances, it shouldn’t. Just because you wouldn’t design something a certain way is neither proof that it came about via an evolutionary process or proof that it didn’t. A better example would be corn, which is probably the most valuable crop in existence but has never in recorded history been a viable plant simply because it requires humans to replant it. That doesn’t mean that there never was a wild version of corn that was adapted to our domesticated version, but it likewise doesn’t mean that its poor “design” or great benefit for humanity can be used as evidence for or against Evolution.\r\n\r\nI personally think the butterfly is a wonderfully amazing, resilient, and adaptive creature showing good evidence of its design. But I certainly understand how someone can look at the same creature and see the cumulative result of millions of years of adaptation. In either case though the thing works and works wonderfully and I think both ID and Evolution are trying to explain how and why it works, not to make the case that it works stupidly.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tq5z","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10185-5fa0c19c-1459-4e3e-b106-11d3284b97a6-1566236761"}

Now we let other countries benefit from something we would be quite capable of profiting from.\r\n\r\nI don't smoke marijuana, but I also see the proof that it's not a gateway drug, is not addictive, and not deadly when grown properly. I wouldn't want my wife and kids smoking it (or smoking anything for that matter), but I think that to win the war on marijuana the best thing to do is legalize it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't believe that legalizing highly addictive compounds would have the same effect. Note in Holland they legalized some highly addictive drugs and they have this tremendous problem controlling the abusers. I read one story where a public museum had a bathroom there. The security guards went in and routinely put in very dim bulbs that were spraypainted over such that you could almost not see your arm. This was to persuade guys from shooting up drugs in there because they couldn't see their arms.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u7c1","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18810-7e37e818-bb4c-49fb-808f-be3d0cdf433c-1566236764"}

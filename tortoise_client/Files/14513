Except most of the complainers were quite drunk. There were a lot of people on the train who countered the drunks complaints, but as the hours crept by, sympathy for the deceased plummeted. Especially as we got into the station 2 1/2 hours late (3am).\r\n\r\nAlthough this story sounds a tad overwrought. I mean, the story sounds as if the 'man in the three piece suit', was the only man in a 3 piece suit on the train. Of course described as \"A man, one of the many dressed for work that day in the customary three piece suit\", doesn't quite make the 'Capitalist = evil' point that the author so desires.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164997965,"score":9,"ups":9,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1749-8b3c0e19-3eb4-4dec-a058-ea747755d3b2-1566236758"}

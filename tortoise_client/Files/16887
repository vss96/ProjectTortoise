So where would we be if we poured 10 frillion dollars into that the next hundred years?\r\n\r\nIf we collectively think our toasters are doing a bang-up job as it is, we should all go \"Ooops!\".\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think the \"unamerican\" reactions are really based on an argument about the economy - that's just rationalization.  Everyone hates a smug bastard eating tofo, riding his bike to work, and always comments \"oh, you own a tv - how quaint\".\r\n\r\nIt makes us all feel guilty for indulging, so screw them and their hippy attitudes. It's unamerican dammit!\r\n\r\nPersonally I think this sounds like a fun experiment. It becomes a game in itself, and taking it to the extreme is part of the deal. It's also a good way to focus on what you have and what you need, without being a wet blanket. You can still get drunk, go to concerts, go snowboarding, etc.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v95u","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166536441,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38178-0f3067e3-6131-4692-8b6c-6a82773bdb9f-1566236772"}

{"body":"The bombs actually do more damage if they're detonated over the target than if they go off at ground level. I think the deal is that at ground height, the downward blast hits the ground then bounces up and creates weird drag pressures and whatnot, inhibiting the blast. By detonating over the target, you put more pressure into the earth without it getting mucked up in the other stuff. Plus, the actual light/radiation from the bomb is so bright that it catches things on fire. If you detonate in the air, there's a large area within line of sight to the bomb.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_v1wz","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166329753,"score":7,"ups":7,"author":"earthboundkid","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cv2xg","parent_id":"t1_cv2ne","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808735,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33358-62c717c0-3d11-46cc-81c5-e0cc95c04a18-1566236770"}

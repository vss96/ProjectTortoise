Were any schools of any use?\r\n\r\nI started learning programming on my dad's Apple ][ with simple BASIC scripts. I think my first real program was a simple football or basketball simulation that printed out play by play and gave you a final score. I started my hatred for all things UI by immediately disliking the graphical version of BASIC that was included -- GBASIC, I think. There was the standard use of Logo in middle school, but I got away from programming for a while in high school. In college, I got back into programming by \"working\" as a content developer for a MUD (theforestsedge.com) and programming more and more complex mob behaviours, that kind of thing. I started writing Perl CGI scripts and Java applets for my simple student website, eventually changed my major to Computer Science and learned to stop fighting my inner geek. Now that I've been out in the \"real world\" developing and testing code a while, I'm not sure when exactly I \"learned\" the most important things. More than likely just sitting around, figuring things out, taking things apart and putting them back together.\r\n\r\n&gt; What do you think is the most important skill every programmer should posses?\r\n\r\nReading comprehension.\r\n\r\n&gt; Do you think mathematics and/or physics are an important skill for a programmer? Why?\r\n\r\nI think these are very valuable to a subset of programmers, namely statistical software, 3D engines, algorithm designers, and people writing mathematically sound security modules. I think most \"programmers\" do not need hardly any math past basic addition and subtraction.\r\n\r\n&gt;  What do you think will be the next big thing in computer programming? X-oriented programming, y language, quantum computers, what?\r\n\r\nIt's easy to say parallelism, but I think the next big thing in computer programming is likely to be the fact that *nearly everyone* is starting to program. Programming and customization based on that is starting to become commonplace everyday things, from people customizing their Blogger.com templates, to writing Lua mods for the World of Warcraft UI, to ... A very *very* close second is speech recognition and natural language processing.\r\n\r\n&gt; If you had three months to learn one relativly new technology, which one would You choose?\r\n\r\nNatural language processing, no doubt about it. I really think this is a truly about to explode area, from the pervasiveness of technology allowing computers and microphones and displays nearly everywhere, to home automation needs, bluetooth, etc. Imagine being comfortably seated in your rocking chair, giving your son a bottle, and being able to say \"computer, please dim the lights 50 percent\" or holding him while he sleeps and being able to say \"computer, please display the next chapter of the book I'm reading on the nearest display\". I'd like to get a handle on how speech processing is done and really try to do some neat things.\r\n\r\n&gt; What do you think makes some programmers 10 or 100 times more productive than others?\r\n\r\nComination of work ethic, enjoying what they do, and internal data processing power.\r\n\r\n&gt; What are your favourite tools (operating system, programming/scripting language, text editor, version control system, shell, database engine, other tools you canâ€™t live without) and why do you like them more than others?\r\n\r\nOS: Debian; Scripting: Jython; Programming: Java; Editor: vi; Version Control System: SVN; Shell: bash.\r\n\r\n&gt; What is your favourite book related to computer programming?\r\n\r\nHm... that's a tough one. I hate all of them.\r\n\r\n&gt; What is Your favourite book NOT related to computer programming?\r\n\r\nThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Heinlein.\r\n\r\n&gt; What are your favourite music bands/performers/compositors?\r\n\r\n\"Modern\" stuff: Radiohead, Teitur, Alexi Murdoch, Jose Gonzalez, Nick Drake, Mason Jennings, Patrick Park, Sufjan Stevens, Andrew Bird... the list goes on and on... For classical I like Rachmaninoff, Sibelius, and Debussy. My favorite jazz will likely always be Miles Davis.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uqk5","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28985-7029d789-8f61-45a4-bb8d-308ff502b1c9-1566236768"}

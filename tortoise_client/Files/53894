{"body":"&gt;Traders and investment bankers (more likely than analysts to get huge payouts) often work on commission. A trader will get a cut of his gains over a year... but this is a bit different than being granted 100,000 shares for getting hired.\r\n\r\nNot really. The trader is responsible for a few positions in a particular market; the Chairman is responsible for the company as a whole. The trader's P&amp;L is the most accurate measure of his success, and the company's stock price is the most accurate measure of the CEO's ability -- at least in the long run. If you gave CEOs a cut of profits instead of an interest in company stock, they'd pile into low-growth, high-profit businesses like commercial banking instead of more lucrative, high-growth stuff like private equity and wealth management.\r\n\r\n&gt;Additionally, a number of the Board members usually aren't shareholders in the company (by design) and make (exorbitant) consultancy fees. While they don't have an interest in overpaying traders, they aren't necessarily against it.\r\n\r\nTrue, and probably the biggest problem in the business. There isn't a good way to build a representative democracy for shareholders -- fortunately, people like [this guy](http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/060807ta_talk_mcgrath) are taking the Lockian approach of overthrowing any leader who doesn't do a good job leading.\r\n\r\n&gt;Namely that revenue employees seem to be de facto more valuable than expense employees. IT employees at these banks are highly skilled and do (I'd imagine) very valuable work...\r\n\r\nOne issue is that you might be trusting an IT guy with some valuable hardware, but you're trusting a trader with millions and millions of dollars of other peoples' money. Overcoming the agency problem is expensive -- you can either make it their money (as in a startup), pay them so well they don't have a reason to screw you (as in Wall Street), or kill their families if they don't do a good job (uncivilized, but pretty effective).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vd09","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166563407,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvese","edited":false,"id":"cveu6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808960,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39332-1d26d71a-531b-46a8-bc31-752cd8b2ecee-1566236773"}

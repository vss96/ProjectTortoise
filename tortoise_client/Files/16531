In fact, he wrote \"Science doesn't work by vote and it doesn't work by authority.\"  You must have seen that, since it's the title given by the article submitter.\r\n\r\nNow, obviously I don't speak for Dawkins but I think his point was that, from the same evidence, creationists draw a conclusion incredibly, fantastically, enormously hugely gigantically different conclusion to the one that happens to have been drawn by others.  He pretty much leaves it at that, but there's an *implied* conclusion: that the orders of magnitude difference make it hugely likely that one side or the other is drastically misinterpreting the evidence.\r\n\r\nNow, the basis of this disagreement is no secret.  Young-earth creationists believe the bible version of events trumps all other evidence; most scientists would consider those to be creation myths and look only at physical evidence rather than writings.\r\n\r\nThe second implied conclusion is that the reader should look  around them at the mountains and cliffs of the world, read a little about the universe and life on earth, and decide that the bible's sequence of events isn't literally accurate.  This doesn't really conflict with religious beliefs; it's not traditional in christianity to consider the holy writings to be perfect or written by God.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56551-405bc5ec-b517-4c4c-adb4-1740510ac0ca-1566236779"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"I use WordPress.  I've edited some of the PHP files that make up WordPress -- such as eliminating all those regexen that replace straight quotes with hideous, half-broken \"smart quotes\" that don't even show up in some visitors' browsers.  That doesn't mean I would have written WordPress in PHP if it had been me that created it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the continuing and repeated need to edit WordPress PHP files, coupled with the lack of an alternative that does as much of what I need as WordPress does, is making me actually start thinking seriously about writing my own weblogging software.  I'd bet dollars against donuts that I won't be writing it in PHP.\r\n\r\nThe fact that every long-time WordPress user that is capable of it has probably edited PHP files in no way means they're all WordPress developers.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vdye","subreddit":"programming","ups":0,"score":0,"created_utc":1166760589,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"apotheon","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvprn","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvevp","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809174,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44899-4ebe0106-e9da-4d11-a807-bc181581d7be-1566236774"}

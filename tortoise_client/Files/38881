For those of us who like to believe that dreams are our subconscious mind's way of dealing with (or alerting us to) problems in our waking world, it's generally accepted that \"falling\" relates to stress and anxiety. In your dream, you're stuck in a bad scenario with no way out; does that description along with the timing of these dreams correspond to anything that's been going on in your daily life?\r\n\r\nDo you actually dream a coherent vision of falling to the ground, with the distance closing in (do you ever hit)? Or is it just a general feeling of weightlessness and sinking? None of these details indicate anything in particular, but a more violent fall might point to a serious stress point, whereas a floating or gliding descent could just be an idle brain making pleasure for itself. Freefalling is fun, after all.\r\n\r\nIt could be much simpler; maybe you travel a lot and dread flying. Sometimes it's you who tells your brain what to see at night, and not the other way around.\r\n\r\n\"A dream is the answer to a question we haven't yet learned how to ask.\"\r\n\r\nCheers","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vqno","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809241,"author":"shaunc","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvtas","parent_id":"t1_cvrhk","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46763-153799e3-4d85-42a8-9c3c-8945314e7198-1566236775"}

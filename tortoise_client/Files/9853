I have used many varieties of Macs over the years, and everyone I know right now has a Mac laptop.  Macs are great.  But on the other hand I went to fry's 2 1/2 years ago and built a desktop PC with a single core 3GHZ CPU and 1 gig of ram running windows XP.  I still have the snappiest, most reliable computer out of everyone.  And this isn't just my opinion. My computer has NEVER frozen, except for when I had a bad memory stick.  Everyone who uses this computer comments on how snappy it is.  And this is with pretty heavy use of way too many programs open,  also network connections open, VPN, C++ development, java environments and development.\r\n\r\nNow I;m sure there is some ways that I could force it to crash, but I just haven't seen all the woes that people talk about.  Sure, a lot of windows bites, but then again a lot of it works just fine.  On the other hand I used Mac OS 9.2 for a few years and that crashed all the time (I know Mac OSX is a different animal).\r\n\r\nForgive me people, this is not a microsoft add at all.  I'm just saying emperically my windows XP PC has performed above my expectations and not anything like what people describe.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809039,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvisp","parent_id":"t1_cvifv","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41365-3559e989-479d-47c1-a73b-04f7ef5d3cf8-1566236773"}

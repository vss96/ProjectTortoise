As a result, NG has formed more brittle regional markets (see Russia putting the screws on Ukraine last winter).\r\n\r\nThe North American regional market is essentially Canada and Mexico selling NG to the US, which is already well past its production peak. Since gas is used to heat buildings, produce electricity, and, increasingly, produce oil from the Alberta Tar Sands, the point at which supply and demand cross paths is going to be the start of some ugly times.","created_utc":1165006594,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2093-7408c41e-9829-4219-aa4c-0b9d1ffbadb3-1566236758"}

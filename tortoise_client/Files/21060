If it's a single individual then there should be a lot of concern. If this guy gives up then you're in trouble. What I'm talking about is \"bench depth\" on the Ruby core team. \r\n\r\nAs and aside, one of my buddies and I were talking about this over lunch. He suggested that the lack of Ruby interpreter developers may be due to the fact that there are fewer and fewer people who work natively in C/C++. Hence there are fewer people willing to deal with what it takes to write an interpreter for something like Ruby. You may counter that there are other languages to code the interpreter in, but C/C++ seems to be the most popular choice and has been for some time.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166146638,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29477-193ebb67-aed2-4e68-8361-5ddd4c4655e4-1566236769"}

I just checked wikipedia and saw what you mean about the counterweight.\r\n\r\nI was on the mailing list for the space elevator, but the satellite wasn't supposed to be the counterweight.  I'd understood the counterweight to be another ribbon stretching out past the satellite.\r\n\r\nIn the design I remembered, the ribbon was basically supporting itself by itself being the counterweight, and the satellite was attached but not really supporting anything.\r\n\r\nIt's *definitely* not currently viable, I agree.  As I said before, it probably won't ever end up being practical even once it's feasible.\r\n\r\nBut flexibility doesn't cause positive reinforcement.  Rigidity can experience vibrations that build on themselves, causing the structure to eventually tear itself apart.  I don't believe it needs to be semi-rigid to avoid this.  I'm not sure how one could make it semi-rigid either.  The extreme length of the ribbon would tend to cancel out any vibrations it experienced if it was rigid though.  The frequency one would need to cause positive feedback on a rigid ribbon extending for 100 miles straight up is something I'm not able to calculate, although I think it would be an extremely low frequency, which doesn't often have high energy.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that the ribbon could whip around a bit in high winds.  This might not be a problem, as long as the base can be secured without being ripped out.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"53951-c6eecd85-b436-4a9d-b03e-12a4fc3a5963-1566236779"}

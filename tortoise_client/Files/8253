Baby boomers start retiring in 2008 according to the article at the top of the Reddit \"Hot\" category.\r\n\r\nThe two largest investigations I can think of involved Mark Folley, right around elecition time, and the Halliburton and other contractor scandals of which you mention.  We all remember when Halliburton contracts came under fire, right?  About the same time Dick Cheney was announced as Bush's VP choice, and the name has remained in the headlines.\r\n\r\nSchlumberge also has had contracting scandals, and many almost as large, but they go unheard of.\r\n\r\nThe pattern I see, repeated over and over, is that the Dems pull out scandal at election times, in order to win seats.  But they let scandal happen when it doesn't benefit them to shine a light on it.  I find this repugnant.\r\n\r\nAnd my comment about them not investigating so far is in reference to Ms. Pelosi's 100 hours.  We're past 100 hours and very little on that list was accomplished.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/11/AR2006111100934.html?nav=rss_print/asection\r\n\r\nAs well as a commitment by Democrat heads not to impeach Bush (middle of the article):\r\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/08/AR2006110800435.html","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39515-bb63d5df-9882-4295-9420-0465f32f1601-1566236773"}

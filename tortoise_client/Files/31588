Every time both of us were silent, dead serious, sweating like pigs and full of adrenaline. \"\r\n\r\nNeither you, nor your opponents were good \"fighters\".\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;\"thus trash talk and looking confident don't have any effect anymore \"\r\n\r\nThat is not exactly what the post said, confidence and taunting is used to scare the opponent first or at least make them rethink their position. and yes, it is best to, and certainly possible to keep shouting in the middle of a fight.\r\n(again, see YouTube)\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;\"Fun is what bullies are after, not real fight.\"\r\n\r\nI am having a hard time not calling you 'retarded'\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;\"If you are not good enough to win bullies with bare knuckles, just run or take the hits two hits and call cops afterward.\"\r\n\r\nagain, see above comment.. the urge is.. getting... stronger\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout your **REAL** advice.....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;\"1) Have good situational awareness. Stay out of fights. Don't be asshole. You don't need to \"stand up\" if you have self confidence.\"\r\n\r\nIf someone starts a fight with you for no particular reason you know of, being an \"asshole\" or having \"situational awareness\" is quite irrelevant.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;\"3) Go close and wrestle.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be really easy to kick your ass. (if you stuck around to get the ass whippin)\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;\"4) Use weapon.

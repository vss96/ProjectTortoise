It was vastly easier than what I'm currently doing, working full-time while going to a University part-time to finish a BS. I must say my civilian life is extremely more flexible than the military ever was.   \r\n    \r\nI may have had it much easier in my day, because I never had to \"deploy\" while on active duty. I just rotated shifts in a 24-hour workcenter.  \r\n    \r\nIn Japan, we had the University of Maryland. The course selection sucked, because getting instructors to live overseas on a military base for little money is always a problem (go figure). But they were real classes from a real university, not a degree mill. I used tuition assistance while on active duty. It was such a great deal that I took a large number of courses.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809071,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvkj0","parent_id":"t1_cvjfe","author":"drosser","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42260-97e9f3b3-92ec-46f1-82e7-dd79da0296f2-1566236774"}

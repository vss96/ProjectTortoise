{"body":"&gt; Now try `[ -x for x in seq if not x%2 ]`, or for that matter, `( 1/x for x in count() )`. :)\r\n\r\nIn Ruby I'd write the first one as `seq.map{|x| -x if x % 2 == 0}.compact` but I don't understand the significance of tuple notation in the second one.  To be honest, I don't really understand the significance of tuples (over lists) in Python to begin with.  Could you enlighten me?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uji8","subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166075843,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"zach","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cunan","id":"cuqgy","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808501,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27544-5b342ed2-bc2d-43da-a6f3-d1e5ffd20638-1566236768"}

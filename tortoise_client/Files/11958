At best they are unproven claims, as you stated yourself.  Your assumption that he's guilty of things they couldn't prove, but killed all the witnesses sounds a lot like a conspiracy theory.  From what I've heard of it, the Clintons actually lost money on the \"Whitewater\" deals.\r\n\r\nI can't find it now, of course, but there's a video around of an interview from a former employee of one of these groups with an impeccable name like \"Christians for a apple pie\" talking about all the dishonest crap he did in the name of promoting Republican leadership.

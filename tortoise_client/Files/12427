The same can be said for a Google/Yahoo comparison.\r\n\r\nDigg and Yahoo throw all of their features in your face at once. It can be confusing. Not to mention Digg gives you not only titles, but also descriptions. This means to effectively take in a lot of information you have to scan quite a bit more space than you do with Reddit. The key with Reddit is that once you see something that interests you, you can click into the article itself and get the more in-depth content, comments, etc.","created_utc":1165282079,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"ctmx5","parent_id":"t3_tk7v","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473807760,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8008-afb60a12-6227-427e-90b4-6b252e68a5f7-1566236760"}

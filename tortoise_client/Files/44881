In theory, Russia today is supposed to be a decent, free-market, democratic country; but in reality it's becoming more and more Neo-USSR.\r\n\r\nThe proposed law is not as much brave, as plain decent thing to do, given the amount of pain and suffering this totalitarian, oppressive regime has caused people all over the world. My own grandfather was deported to Siberia to work in a slave camp and eventually die from cold and malnutrition. He came back, but many didn't.\r\n\r\nIt's weird how some people in Western Europe and USA view wearing a red shirt with a hammer and sickle or the acronym 'CCCP' as something hip or neat; yet wearing a shirt with a swastika on it would be, mildly put, frowned upon. But of course, those that win the war, write the history and the Stalinist Holocaust never entered the Western collective psyche.","score":13,"ups":13,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166501240,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cv8ga","edited":false,"id":"cvb4t","author":"frukt","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808890,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37502-68293a2d-dcb0-4e11-9754-7c3439108b0c-1566236772"}

In fact, they're not associative under addition or multiplication and they don't satisfy distributivity. Another thing is that because 0 and (-0) are not the same number, although they compare equal, one can find x, y, floating point numbers, and a function f such that x = y, but f(x) is not equal to f(y). (In particular, x = 0, y = (-0), f(x) = 1/x.)","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ty8s","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807977,"author":"cgibbard","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctyjn","parent_id":"t1_ctyj3","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13484-dc490700-b96c-438e-8de2-942984e3f8a5-1566236762"}

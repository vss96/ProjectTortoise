Ruby folks will point you to the gems. PHP folks will point you to PEAR. Perl folks can kick everyone's ass by pointing to the CPAN.\r\n\r\nAnd Common Lisp folks will point you to CLiki.\r\n\r\n&gt; And if there's no standard or third-party module available, odds are that people in every one of those communities will be happy to help you walk through the implementation, or maybe even contribute some code because it'll help make the language that much better.\r\n\r\nPlease substantiate this claim, and more specifically, when the context is a flame-war.  Here, you got people who will, on one hand, make uninformed/irrelevant claims about the Other Language, and on the other hand, (rightly) defend their Own Language from such claims.  People who have no knowledge, or little knowledge, or outdated knowledge, about one of the languages suddenly bring along claims about it after defending the one they know.  Amusing, don't you think?  For a while, at least.  To make an understatement, not everyone posting in this thread, or even replying to that message, is interested in the specific library itself.\r\n\r\n&gt; Lisp? Lisp tells you it'll be trivial to implement, so why don't you get on that?\r\n\r\nLisp doesn't _tell_ me things.  Maybe I'm using it wrong?\r\n\r\nYour complaint about CAR/CDR is silly, and Lisp doesn't think, as far as I know.  Languages are evolved by their users; they don't appear from spontaneous generation.  Many words change meaning from their original stipulation to something that fits the language users's needs.  The meaning of CAR/CDR changed fairly early on, and thus people familiar with one dialect of Lisp can use some of their conceptual fund of knowledge and terminology with other dialects, and sometimes with other, non-Lisp, programming languages.  If you take the preservation of terms designating useful concepts to be the best example of \"prominent Lispers\" being stuck in the past, then the level of your analysis is rather shallow.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, CAR and CDR _are_ excellent mnemonics, if only because they (i) are short in length; (ii) are of the same length; (iii) are lexically similar but moderately distinguishable; (iv) have convenient pronunciation; (v) are naturally extendable (e.g., CAAR/CDAR/CDDR, which is useful for top-level hacks).  They're also not completely arbitrary, as you explained.\r\n\r\nSometimes historical baggage is problematic (e.g., arbitrary limitations for integer arithmetic, which some \"modern\" \"high-level\" languages set), but the CAR/CDR case isn't one such case.  At least not for _users_ of Lisp.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808468,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuo3e","id":"cuop9","author":"death","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26714-dd5d6802-0eb4-4011-bd22-a9a4f09087b6-1566236767"}

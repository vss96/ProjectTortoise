After doing some research I found some important facts about winter survival.\r\n\r\n- You can go up to three weeks without food if you have good shelter and water.\r\n- If you keep yourself warm with a fire (or any source of energy) you will last longer without food. \r\n\r\n- Once the car is out of gas (to use the heater), the car sucks as a shelter; too much metal. They recommend making one with snow, wood and brushwood.\r\nEDIT:(Ok after reading some more the car seams to be a good shelter after all. So forget this.)\r\n\r\nKnowing that information I think a better plan would have be.\r\n\r\n1 - Use car as a shelter untill the gas is gone.\r\n\r\n2 - Build a shelter with snow and branches and non metallic part from the car. (Rugs, seats, plastic dash.) EDIT:(Forget this, stay in your car)\r\n\r\n3 - Start collecting wood or branches to make a fire (his idea of using the tires was a very good one too)\r\n\r\n4 - Use the fire to melt snow and make water.\r\n\r\n5 - Stay all together but use everything you find and any spare time you have to build the largest big ass signal you can make in the middle of the road or any clear spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvxs","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807954,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ArcticCelt","parent_id":"t1_ctx30","edited":false,"id":"ctxcb","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12960-7dc11e99-a0f6-4be6-9539-771742b92693-1566236762"}

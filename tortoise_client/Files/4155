That's about as close to science as astrology - you make vague predictions that can usually be interpreted to apply to any given person, and ignore the cases where they don't apply.\r\n\r\n&gt; and peer reviewed by one man.\r\n\r\nIt's not peer review if it's your own work.\r\n\r\n&gt; There's no evidence, not in the slightest, that says reincarnation can't happen\r\n\r\nThe scientific method is unable to prove negatives like that.  The burden of proof is on the person making the claim that it *does* happen, and from what I've read, that book falls far, far short in many regards.\r\n\r\n&gt; there is scientific evidence that it doesn't.\r\n\r\nEr, did you mean to say that?\r\n\r\n&gt; How hard is it to simply open your mind\r\n\r\nHaving an open mind does not mean accepting whatever you are told.  Sure, with the most superficial glance, the twenty cases seem to be evidence.  But on closer examination, they are nothing of the sort.\r\n\r\nIf you truly believe that these twenty cases were really reincarnation, then you should be angry at Dr Stevenson for rendering them useless to science and worthless as evidence.\r\n\r\nDo you have actual scientific evidence?  That isn't tainted by poor methodology, leading questions, selection bias, etc?\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vo8v","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166784790,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45150-bfad0570-92ba-4476-b2ac-27ad48f9becd-1566236774"}

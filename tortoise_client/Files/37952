I put up with (3) breaking every so often, but this is just too much.\r\n\r\nThis is a classic case of sound bite driven design. I think that (2) happened when the team behind Yahoo TV heard that CSS was in and tables were out. (3) happened when (2) didn't work, and (4) happened when somebody heard that all the cool kids are using that Ajax thingy.\r\n\r\nThe worst part is that few things are easier to get right than TV listings. An HTML table is not only the semantically correct way to mark it up, it's also the easiest. They had it right in the beginning.\r\n\r\nNow, can anyone suggest a TV listing site meeting these criteria?\r\n\r\n * Clean and readable\r\n * No login required\r\n * Allows bookmarking the full grid of current local listings\r\n * Doesn't bring my browser to its knees\r\n\r\nYahoo TV *used* to do all that.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165254905,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6993-7e77a24b-b369-4fc7-bc50-49dbaa0302a6-1566236760"}

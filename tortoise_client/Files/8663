{"body":"I'm an ASP for both Dell and Apple as well, and your experiences are not consistent with my own.\r\n\r\nBoth vendors are pretty bad with regard to phone support, and while Warranty Parts Direct is pretty good for ordering parts, Apple's GSX system is just as good, if not better. The only time I've not received parts next day from Apple was when they were out of stock. \r\n\r\nI've never had to justify my troubleshooting to Apple, whereas with Dell, we're constantly reminded that if we certify a part as bad and return it, and Dell discovers it is, in fact, not bad, they might withdraw our ASP status.\r\n\r\nAs for getting technicians on site, why would you want them? If you're an ASP, you're supposed to be able to replace components yourself. On the rare occasions that I've had a tech dispatched by either vendor (typically through miscommunication) they've always been from Unisys, and only made the problems more difficult by adding an unnecessary layer of complication to what should be a simple solution.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wd3v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167418203,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Roninspoon","parent_id":"t1_cwdfd","id":"cwdr9","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809628,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57200-23defc31-49ef-4fc7-a524-e0fb0eabba32-1566236779"}

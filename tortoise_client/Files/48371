It looks like the court ruled that *the family* of the deceased did not own the organs and did not have the right to decide who gets them, not that the deceased should not have the right to decide where the organs go.\r\n\r\nThe article doesn't really discuss whether selecting an organ recipient before death is an option for a dying person, but this might be an option in limited circumstances (where the dying person is in a hospital or hospice and is able to make decisions before death).\r\n\r\nI think the important point encoded in common law is that whatever we own, *we* cease to exist at death, and cannot make decisions regarding our remains. I would argue that organs should be willable though, although impact on shortages would be negligible.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w547","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54386-4584a1fe-47a2-4fd1-97fc-91a3f50ffa2e-1566236779"}

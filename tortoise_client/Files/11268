Some great hindu personalities in the past were deeply influenced by vege lifes and professed this. 2500 years ago hindus were hugely meat eaters. but there personalites born at that time changed it. today 60% hindus eat meat. but 90% of them probably eat only once in a week. even hindus living in cheap-meat counties like us dont eat that much of meat as others here do. I am an Atheist Hindu and Vegetarian since birth. Vege not beacause somebody dictates this to me. Or for some after-life indicement. Mostly because of my family tradition and I cannot find even a single reason for i should break it.

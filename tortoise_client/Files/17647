Even on the slim chance that he did ascend to the presidency under the agreement that he'd pardon Nixon he had *no* reason to do so once he was President. None. He had a lot of reasons not to, notably the fact that it would drop his approval rating over 30 points. The pardon might be a lot of things, but one thing it certainly wasn't was cronyism.\r\n\r\nAnd he didn't market it that brilliantly, did he? He didn't win re-election.\r\n\r\nYou and Bogotha make a better point with precedent, but clearly the precedent of leniency and moving on hasn't been followed at all, has it? If anything the opposite has happened with partisan politics being taken to the extreme today. The Clinton impeachment is a perfect example in which someone was held to the \"highest standard\" as opposed to just moving on. The same will happen with Bush and all the scrutany the democratic congress is about to put on his administration.\r\n\r\nAnd I have no idea what your last question there was about.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1167319023,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cw97k","parent_id":"t1_cw77h","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473809543,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54954-5f8e043b-bebc-408c-8120-1fb283553051-1566236779"}

Fine.  Freedom of speech.  Whatever.  \r\n\r\nThen, while stopped at a light, she noticed that the protesters were snapping pictures of people coming out of the store, and their cars and license plates.  If they were to post those pictures on the Internet or attempt to confront those involved in a less anonymous place (I can't imagine many other things they'd do with them), that has the power to ruin lives.\r\n\r\nThey believe in a personal God who commands them to bring salvation to everyone, care for everyone, and especially care for the \"sinners\".  Despite this they maliciously trample over the little guy to get their way.  Hypocrites.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vkuw","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43247-9885ffe7-1917-4166-b42f-49bb60c52448-1566236774"}

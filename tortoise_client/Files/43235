How many startups can afford to pay you $110k/year (where a large corporation would pay $130k) AND gourmet lunches every day? Probably the same place Joel talks about that has unlimited candy and Aeron chairs and 30 inch monitors and 18-year-old courtesans orally pleasuring you all day (ok, I just made up that last one).\r\n\r\nMr. Writer, maybe *you* found the absolute dream job where you get everything on your fantasy list, but don't go around thinking that your anecdotal experience is statistically significant. And get off the high horse and denigrate everyone who doesn't make the same choices as you as \"irrational\", either. We'll see how smug you feel if things at your startup take a turn for the bad -- when your paychecks start bouncing, the catered lunches become increasingly rare, and the boss becomes a ghost because he has to spend all his time pleading for funding.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t576","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807493,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t3_t576","id":"ct8qj","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1415-eb1d6212-ab76-4c81-8e26-8d264b00cf3c-1566236758"}

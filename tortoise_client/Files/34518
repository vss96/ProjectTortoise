What king? (looks under bed) there's none here! That idea is nonsense. I earned what I own, or it was given to me by other people who earned it. Maybe a few people still have stuff inherited from kings. So what? Any static unit of wealth will easily be dwarfed by wealth creation. Even the Queen of England is rich, not because of what she got, but because of the good use she's made of it.\r\n\r\nThe pact of property among people isn't an item of history, it's a moral system and for those who follow it, a unilateral default. I will begin by respecting your person and property and assume you'll do the same. I need no signature from you to do this. If it later becomes apparent you don't respect them, you've exempted yourself; force is justified to rectify force. And then stop.\r\n\r\nYou assume property is unable to withstand power, but you haven't observed the very real extent that power is *weaker* in modern society than ever before, and that's largely due to the system of property. It's the self same system which produced the computer on which you read this - purely for profit, and yet look how it makes you more powerful! Everything which empowers the individual, disempowers those who would push him around.","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33202-f327014d-f0be-4c2d-9043-cefb8108a428-1566236770"}

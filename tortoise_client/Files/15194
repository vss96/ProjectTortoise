Modern solar panels can achieve between 12-20%. The peak of commercially available technology is around 25%, but at that point it isn't particularly cost-effective. And I believe some researchers have prior to this claimed efficiencies in the low-to-mid 30%s, but it has yet to become commercial available.","controversiality":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165517749,"subreddit":"science","id":"cu0in","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu0a7","author":"cecilkorik","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808014,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14290-d60fd184-da44-478d-b25f-50f4f0d4d1d9-1566236762"}

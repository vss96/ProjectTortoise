If you watch TV in Japan, you will notice that almost all of it has subtitles in Japanese. Because without the kanji it is too difficult to interpret what people are saying, even with context. \r\n\r\nThe good thing about kanji is that even if you don't know a word, you can often enough piece together an approximate meaning from the kanji that are employed. And if you know the kanji, it speeds up reading a great deal. Reading things aloud is still quite difficult, because there are so many different pronunciations for everything, but reading for meaning is very fast.","retrieved_on":1473809391,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cw19c","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw0jr","author_flair_text":null,"author":"donkeymon","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50744-5bfe8689-eba1-4156-b428-7f3acae216c1-1566236778"}

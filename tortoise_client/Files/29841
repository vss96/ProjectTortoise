Or are there really people who have never heard of C (which provided the basic syntax for PHP - but also of Java of course)?\r\n\r\nUsing '-&gt;' for properties is a so/so idea. It's better then simply using '.' because this could break backward compatibility. Also with '-&gt;' it's easy to see what is happening without looking at the implementation of the class. OTOH '-&gt;' looks quite ugly and I'm a bit skeptical if we really need properties in Java. The problem is that if properties are 'to easy' people tend to misuse them.\r\n\r\n","link_id":"t3_wcxk","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167407622,"score":6,"ups":6,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56861-a85a0242-acfc-42b1-b353-5154d9a1c32c-1566236779"}

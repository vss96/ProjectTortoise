But the disciples were indignant when they saw this, and said, \"Why this waste? For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor.\"\r\nBut Jesus, aware of this, said to them, \"Why do you bother the woman? For she has done a good deed to Me. \"For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have Me. For when she poured this perfume on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial. Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her.\"\r\nThen one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, \"What are you willing to give me to betray Him to you?\" And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him. From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.","ups":-1,"score":-1,"created_utc":1166139822,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuu2g","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuso2","author_flair_text":null,"author":"degustibus","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808568,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29262-c010efa2-e266-4d2d-bb2d-97c83534c6ba-1566236769"}

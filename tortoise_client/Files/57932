You've actually given me a quite a bit to think about.  I went to the Wikipedia entry for Sociopath and read it to refresh my memory as it's been a while since high school Psychology.  I concede that you are right that \"sociopathic behavior is sociopathic behavior.\"  I guess I was trying to make more of a point about the nature of empathy.  It only matters that the individual is engaging in sociopathic behavior, and not whether the other person is as well.\r\n\r\nIn addition I'd like to thank you again for your polite, well thought, and well articulated response.  I'm glad this didn't turn into one of those sociopathic exchanges!  Looking forward to more of your comments in the future.","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48195-f7c6fa02-4f28-4a8c-becb-95e32a679ad3-1566236777"}

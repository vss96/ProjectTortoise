{"body":"I think that the reason this story is a \"story\" is because Israel is massively supported by the US as a democracy in the region and it is assumed/accepted that the two countries share certain values such as equal rights etc. The situation in Iran is different in that they are not supported by the US and are in fact widely criticised for what we consider to be human rights abuses.\r\n\r\nI do agree, however, that insufficient criticism is made of Saudi Arabia and i put this down to the fact that certain very powerful elements within the US make an awful lot of moolah from that country.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vat3","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":21,"ups":21,"created_utc":1166509092,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"zube001","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvbfp","id":"cvbj2","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808898,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37696-db5d7f7b-1589-4a71-8755-b42954868562-1566236772"}

I take it that the Brazil reference is meant to invite the inference that the ASA is some many-tentacled agency of state control. A strange comment to make in light of this being a story about how they took no action on the basis of a small nummber of complaints.\r\n\r\nBeing a UK reisdent I do know something about how advertising regulation happens in the UK, it mostly doesn't.\r\n\r\nThe ASA needs lot of people to complain about an ad (which can be done by filling in a form on the website) before they will take action, and even then the action might not be much more than preventing, say, and ad with overtly sexual content being displayed near schools. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the ASA will have an ad campaign cancelled outright on the basis that what's claimed in it just *isn't true*. \r\n\r\nYeah, that's a pretty opressive regualtory burden we labour under here in the UK...","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tfjv","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165164751,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5068-38bce2e9-3b4d-4cff-9409-2a03d581b2fa-1566236759"}

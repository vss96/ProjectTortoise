My point is to not have to ask the user to install anything. Right now it is only safe to assume that someone will have DHTML, Javascript and (limited) CSS. Using these tools you can make some impressive dynamic applications.\r\n\r\nIt's all about how much you want to expect from your users and what you want your target audience to be. If you want the broadest possible user base you have to make the most with the least amount of tools. If you can limit yourself to standard compliant browsers you can do a lot more since you have more tools. If you don't mind asking them to have things installed, you can do even more (java applets, flash plugins).","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_th5j","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807712,"author":"enjahova","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctkch","parent_id":"t1_ctjf9","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6741-4a90be4c-98a9-422f-8785-a9bc26cf2442-1566236760"}

That's why services such as Geek Squad are so succcessful.\r\n\r\nNo media has -ever- given as much spotlight to everyday issues such as those simply because they do not sell papers or generate advertising revenue.

It is the bogeyman on which to assert blame and fear while they ignore the threats that are most likely to cause them harm.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166630730,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvi28","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvh0x","author":"cal_01","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809024,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40996-80223e81-8041-493b-8a49-15de22a22a06-1566236773"}

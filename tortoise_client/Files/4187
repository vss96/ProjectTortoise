{"body":"wait...so your complaint is that a group of people that you obviously hate and despise don't take care of you like they take care of one of their own?  When did Mormon's not taking care of you amount to persecution?  Maybe you have more specific instances, but having lived my whole life around Mormon's, and the vast majority of that as a non-practicing Mormon, I find that most claims of persecution have no factual basis.  If you aren't a Mormon, you aren't expected to like them, it's pretty ironic though that you complain about them not taking care of you despite your obvious hatred.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vnhg","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166796692,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"beowulf","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvqrl","parent_id":"t1_cvqk6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809192,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45335-cebb8702-d6da-4ea3-ab7a-f9bea3128cf5-1566236774"}

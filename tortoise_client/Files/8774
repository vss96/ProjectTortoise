Communism and fascism resemble each other more than they are willing to admit\". There is one big difference though: nationalism. Stalin really started to bend towards nationalism in his dying years, starting from 1950 maybe. At that time all the \"true\" marxists from the Soviet Communist Party had long been dead or in concentration camps. I don't want to be apologetic towards the communists, I'm not, just wanted to say that Europe was a lot more complicated then this guy in the article said. And of course, America had its Lindberghs too, but he fails to mention that.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33781-c4df7c41-63a8-45a7-a624-a7f84c318aba-1566236771"}

You are right and the reason is simple:  The store is evaluated based largely on how long it takes from the time the customer starts ordering to the time the customer is handed his/her meal and has left far enough to stop triggering the sensor under the final drive through window.\r\n\r\nThis means that a single customer taking time to decide what to order and then fumbling change will make the store look slow even if the actual food is magically prepared instantly.\r\n\r\nThis may seem unfair to the people in the store, but what is being measured is essentially the throughput in cars/minute.\r\n\r\nThis is what's actually important from the point of view of the customer.  If there's a long line, then how long is the wait actually going to be?\r\n\r\nI know for a fact that if every customer is like you that a 20 second average is doable, which means that even a very long line would not cause you to wait very long.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand 1 person taking a few minutes to decide what to get then fumbling for change at the window when it would be quicker to just use the $20 and let the drive through person make change can really wreck things for every single person in line behind him/her.\r\n\r\nThis is why I almost never use the drive thru any more.  I'm on a special diet so I have to have everything made special (Basically very low carb, with some additional restrictions).  I'm not about to do that to someone's average time, or to the people waiting in line behind me.\r\n\r\nInstead I walk inside, smile and chat with the people and make friends, and always leave with food that is just a little fresher and nicer than the average customer gets :)","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_upgw","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808585,"author":"Joss","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuv0s","parent_id":"t1_cutd7","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29776-99423b48-88aa-4efc-a326-9ea43261358f-1566236769"}

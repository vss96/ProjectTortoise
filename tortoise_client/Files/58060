If the cops torture you, then you confess, then they go to your house and find the body in your backyard, you can still get off on a technicality. But really, when that happens, what should be done is the cops should be sent to jail for torture. But you should also go to jail, on account of that body in your backyard. \r\n\r\nIn the Padilla case, if the only evidence they have is a forced confession, then they don't have any evidence at all. Forced confessions are worthless.

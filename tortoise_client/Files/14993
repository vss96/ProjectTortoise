Asking \"What the ratio between the speed of light and infinity?\" is a mistake.\r\n\r\nGreat, so we are in agreement.  Trying to compare ratios between theories is a pointless task, because of the possibility of it giving you infinite answers.  Why Dawkins thinks it is a task worth pursuing is beyond me.\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there any more direct way to measure time than using isotope decay techniques?\r\n\r\nYou can measure time using:\r\n\r\n* pendulums\r\n* astronomy\r\n* atomic clocks\r\n* springs\r\n* counting in your head\r\n* etc\r\n\r\nHowever, you obviously can't measure the age of the earth using these techniques.  The age of the earth is measured using the most direct means available, of course, but that doesn't make it particularly direct.\r\n\r\nMeasuring time using isotope decay requires other assumptions such as:\r\n\r\n* radioactivity being proportional to the amount of substance\r\n* radioactivity not being related to any other conditions that might have been around 4 billion years ago\r\n* universal physical constants genuinely being constant over the last 4 billion years.  A tiny change in the fine structure constant has enormous effects on the halflife of elements.  If i recall my university nuclear physics correctly, there is an e^e^x relationship somewhere in the equations.\r\n* etc\r\n\r\nThat everyday objects are the size we measure them relies on far fewer untested assumptions.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56705-911eda74-eb09-47ba-a1ba-fdccb252fbc9-1566236779"}

{"body":"Yes, let's take one verse out of the Bible and take it out of context.\r\n\r\nMany women felt that when they were in church it a time to gossip and chat.  This had become such a problem that Paul felt the need to rebuke them publically, basically stating that they need to shut the hell up and pay attention.  If they didn't understand something, don't ask questions at church but wait until you get home and sort it out.\r\n\r\nThe original greek used qyne, which can mean wife or women, but the context is clear that Paul was adressing married women.  Wives weren't used to the public protocols and Paul was instructing them on proper behavior.\r\n\r\nThe whole point was to shut chatty-kathy's up long enough so everyone could learn the sermon.  It wasn't a time to keep interrupting with questions and trying to outdo one another.\r\n\r\nThe entire chapter is about correcting wrong behavior and isn't implied to mean that these things should apply to all people at all times.\r\n\r\nPaul had no problem with women teaching men, teaching the Bible or speaking of the Bible.  His problem was with women who wouldn't shut up and who felt that they should teach to make themselves appear better to others.\r\n\r\nIf Paul had intended on restricting ministry to only men, he wouldn't have spent so much time including women and stating how they were equal with men in edifying the church.\r\n\r\nThese two verses are also controversial because there is some evidence that it wasn't translated quite right and there is some question as to whether they were originally Paul's words or if Paul had seperated these verses a little from the rest of the chapter, almost as if they were an aside.\r\n\r\nYou also run into a similar problem in I Timothy 2:11-12, but there it is a mistranslation more than anything else.  The problem arises from translating to English from the Latin, which used a more modern definition than using the original meaning of the word in greek. \r\n\r\nJust don't cherry pick verses to your own liking when they suit you.  You have to include everything to get the meaning, which includes historical context.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vat3","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166519759,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"berberine","parent_id":"t1_cvb6z","id":"cvbx7","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808905,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37884-3d470ab2-fd9e-43f8-88b1-8e21a698f6ae-1566236772"}

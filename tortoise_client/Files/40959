I know most modern cars have limiters preventing people from going faster than, say, 128mph, but why that speed? Why not 90mph? (a comfortable margin above maximum speed limits) Like fully automatic machine guns, there seems to be no good reason why normal people need to own cars that go well over 100mph.","controversiality":0,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1166082290,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27641-cdaa1bfa-a300-4400-9366-7f8f1b592f07-1566236768"}

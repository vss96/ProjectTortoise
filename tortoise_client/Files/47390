They could work on the most amazing research, engineer unspeakably gorgeous machines, build (and preserve) the world's knowledge and spread the cause of freedom and self-sufficiency throughout a world full of their amazing inventions.\r\n\r\nThe fear-driven regime which now tortures its citizens and operates gulags holding *thousands* of un-charged detainees in no way resembles the United States I knew.\r\n\r\nThere's freedom in this world.  There are forces for *right*, but they're sure as hell not living south of the 49th parallel today.  With a hearty \"**FUCK YOU**\", this news from your Government drives the last nail into that coffin.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your turkey.  Be sure to stuff yourself into the obedient somnolence your President expects.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vwwj","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1167004295,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49164-e5328f82-33d5-42d9-bd53-62ee0baf58b4-1566236777"}

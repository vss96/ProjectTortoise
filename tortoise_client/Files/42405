{"controversiality":0,"body":"I agree with the points made, all the things mentioned in the article are actually better in Django. But, Rails has some great features that are not in Django too.\r\n\r\nOne of those is Rake. It allows you to deploy your application easily, it can for example set up your database with one simple command. You can also build API documentation with it, for which you have to use other tools in Django. And, when you run your unit tests with it, it even sets up a temporary database with sample data.\r\n\r\nAnother great thing in Rails are plugins. I don't know much about the middleware in Django, but it doesn't seem like there is so many middleware available for Django as there are plugins for Rails. You also can't do everything with middleware, so the functionality provided through Rails plugins may either be middleware for Django, or a separate application.\r\n\r\nBut how would you for example add tagging to an application? It doesn't fit in another application, because a tag is in fact just another object (with a many-to-many relationship to the tagged items) in your existing application. It also doesn't belong in middleware. Then where do you put it? You can't possible build it from scratch every time you need it?","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvf3","subreddit":"programming","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165520829,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"JW_00000","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_tvf3","id":"cu0tp","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808019,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14404-490241e3-fb6a-4d3b-a076-77555429afbe-1566236762"}

{"controversiality":1,"body":"\"You are reading too much into those signs.\r\n\r\nMecca is not just a tourist destination like Disneyland: it's a sacred pilgramage and a symbol of unity for the Muslim world.\"\r\n\r\nI like how this comment was modded down, since it does provide a reasonable explanation to the signs. And people would just readily believe in the pictures and constitute it as discrimanatory (and admittedly, to an extent it really is). However, most churches have become tourist spots and that's why a lot of them allow people of other religions to enter. And I don't think there is a central spot that is as highly regarded and holy as the place Mecca is to Muslims for people of other religions.","link_id":"t3_upl4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166115732,"ups":0,"score":0,"author":"gumjo","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_upl4","id":"cus77","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808532,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28267-f152edaf-dd32-4b2b-98f7-91c5214d7375-1566236768"}

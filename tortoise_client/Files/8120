At least, I have mild versions of the symptoms for the condition.\r\n\r\nThe tiredness I feel after drinking coffee every day for a few days is similar to the feeling you get with low blood sugar. I also feel progressively more scatter-brained and anxious the more I drink it on consecutive days.\r\n\r\nSo, I've stopped drinking coffee entirely and have switched to green tea, which gives me a boost without many ill effects. I still have to take a break from it every once in awhile, or the scatter-brained and anxiousness return.","link_id":"t3_v461","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808761,"distinguished":null,"author":"NoFixedAbode","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cv46f","id":"cv49k","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33977-681b5700-9880-4426-bf16-5cdb4b4ac0e8-1566236771"}

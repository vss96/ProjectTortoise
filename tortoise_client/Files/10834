She was very attracted to him and during her questions about his life, she asked him how he managed for sex.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe explained to him what sex was and he said, \"Oh, Tarzan use hole in trunk of tree.\"\r\n\r\nHorrified, she said, \"Tarzan you have it all wrong! I will show you how to do it properly.\" She took off her clothes, laid down on the ground, and spread her legs. \"Here,\" she said, pointing, \"You must put it in here.\"\r\n\r\nTarzan removed his loincloth, stepped closer and then gave her an almighty kick in the crotch.\r\n\r\nJane rolled around in agony. Eventually she managed to gasp, \"What the hell did you do that for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tarzan check for squirrels.\"","link_id":"t3_udwe","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165853048,"score":17,"ups":17,"author":"chime","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cug2w","parent_id":"t1_cueo5","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808306,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22459-b6241305-59da-43e1-8af0-c0983bbbee9b-1566236766"}

The hard part about abolishing \"taste is subjective\" is to do so while avoiding the art equivalent of concentration camps (you can't force a minimum ear-growing speed).\r\n\r\nMaybe the sensible answer is: \"yes, taste is subjective, but how many ears have you grown last month?\" :)\r\n\r\nHmmm. Enough abuse of weird analogies on my part for one evening.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ufsk","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808328,"author":"mbrezu","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuh96","parent_id":"t1_cuh57","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23111-e9b5cf8a-1651-4d6b-a0eb-c26039814f87-1566236766"}

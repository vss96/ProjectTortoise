Most of the buyers pre-christmas are mums and dads trying to find something to impress their kids. They really know nothing about consoles, but with such a big fuss about Wii on TV, they're bound to have heard of it and want to buy it for their kids.\r\n\r\nI mean, you'd have to be pretty desperate to pay 2x or more retail price for a console when you can just wait a few months and save all that money (unless christmas is your deadline). So all it shows is that the parents that aren't really going to use the console are buying Wii. I bet there's loads of kids who opened boxes on christmas to find a Wii, who are thinking \"my parents are so lame, don't they know this is junk - why didn't they save the money towards a PS3\"","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w37e","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-6,"ups":-6,"created_utc":1167212305,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52679-a0bbad02-74ae-4167-ba4e-42e841fef9c6-1566236778"}

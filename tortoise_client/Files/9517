Price doesn't mean jack. \r\n\r\nThe best vodka brand I've tried thus far comes from Belarus, closely followed by selected Russian brands absolutely unheard of anywhere but in Russia. Those ones genuinely deserve the name \"vodka\". They are so excellently distilled that they really smell and taste pretty much like water, don't have any aftertaste, and don't get you a shallow sleep or a hard next morning. It's really like drinking water except that you're getting drunk. Absolutely fascinating. \r\n\r\nBack to the point: those said fine vodkas are not only incredibly better than The Bestest Big Brands you can find in Germany (that all smell and taste like kerosene); they are also orders of magnitude cheaper than the cheapest worst crap you can get in a German supermarket. \r\n\r\nAs a result, Germans either happily throw out their money on Big-Brand kerosene (\"no way cheaper is better!\") or wrinkle their noses on vodka altogether and turn to tequila or their own Schnaps/Korn. It's really freaking hard to get a German to try The Real Thing. Which is a shame. I am not sure about the situation in the US though.\r\n\r\n*EDIT: fixed the last paragraph.*","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tudz","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13037-32c763c6-5981-4085-b8fb-1f59b34d60d0-1566236762"}

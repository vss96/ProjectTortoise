Ridiculous. It works for some (5%) of the people, afterall. Bummer.\r\n- Too many buttons.\r\n- Stupid lawsuit in a time where everybody copies everybody.\r\n- Too many models (Zen Ultra Plus Pro Lite...)\r\n- Stupid software. I have 80Gbytes of stuff in iTunes, via NFS, and it works flawlessly, and fast (on a Mac Mini; don't  know if it works that good for Windows people).\r\n- They were big and bulky (don't know about current models).\r\n- I don't hear different sounds.\r\n- The difference of price is not that great.\r\n- Creeping featuritis.\r\n\r\nThat said, they have these advantages:\r\n\r\n- Replaceable battery (don't know if it for all models, there's so much of them).\r\n- FM tuner (I never listen to radio).\r\n\r\nI had other players, and they sucked. With iTunes + iPod, even old people can make it work. The *user-friendlyness* surpasses other misfeatures of the iPod, such as zealotry and the fact that Apple cannot produce massive products without a noticeable rate of failure.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ugs5","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808382,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"9ner","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuil7","id":"cuk03","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24538-0c5e70b2-9903-4c07-903d-1b3a380966aa-1566236767"}

([Nietzsche][nietzsche] can help us with this:  [Beyond Good and Evil][bgae] is a good place to start).  (Also, speaking of false distinctions, [Herbert Brun][brun] clarifies the importance of drawing accurate distinctions, and the dangers of abusing faulty distinctions.)  In their place, let us raise, in the context of \"suffering\",  the concepts of \"knowingly and willingly contributing to suffering\" to replace \"evil\" and \"knowingly and willingly relieving suffering\" to replace \"good\".  These concepts imply that we all commit acts of \"evil\" and acts of \"good\", that no person is entirely \"good\" or \"evil\" unless they only relentlessly commit acts that contribute to or relieve suffering, and none of the other kind (which I will not rule out, though I find it implausible).  Further, this implies that each act probably has a healthy dose of both, ie it increases suffering for one or some and relieves suffering for others.  This is a much more useful way to think about the issue, and clarifies many otherwise fuzzy moral issues.  For instance, assisted suicide.  In cases where \"good\" and \"evil\" get involved with this debate, all kinds of animosity and pain are reaped upon both sides.  Viewed from the perspective of suffering however, the issue becomes clear (well, relatively).  We can ask, will allowing this person to commit humane willful suicide increase or decrease their and their loved ones suffering?  If they and their loved ones are suffering greatly, they have accepted an already inevitable death, and their death will give everyone involved the chance to finally relieve their suffering, then it could be considered \"evil\" to **prevent** them from making this choice.  The same reasoning applies to abortion, education, government, etc.  Of course, the real world is full of suffering, and measuring such a thing as the \"quantity of suffering\" is prone to all kinds of distortion, which is why many decisions are so difficult to make, and coming down with a blanket judgement of what is right and what is wrong such an absurd task (which is what it seems our courts are implying by their mere existence).  Really though, all of this talk of the root of all evil, or also known as \"Why isn't everyone nice to eachother all the time?\", really comes down to power.  Power.  Also known as \"Why does it feel so good to hurt this person right now?\" (Because they wronged you?  That's a good reason!  Because they threaten the things you care about?  That's a good reason!  Because they didn't do what they were supposed to, and inconvenienced or harmed you or others?  That's a good reason!)  Power is more fundamental than \"goodness\", power is essential to life at its most basic:  even [cells][cell] know about power.  Power is the power to get things done.  It takes power to move your arm.  Think of how many precisely synchronized actions must take place all throughout your arm, nerves, brain, blood cells, all designed to orchestrate a precisely guided storm of chemical reactions that cause **an entire arm** to lift itself from its place beside you.  Now think of how much power it takes to see, to think, and how much **power** it took to build that machine you are staring into, and the entire network of tubes that enable this comment to beam around to any browser that happens to navigate to precisely this location.  Power is what lets some people just hang around the house and watch Pop Idol while others are starving and hiding from gunmen.  Religions are power networks larger than you or I alone, and they have been functioning long before we were ever born.  Do not be fooled by their irrationality, the reason religions can be so blatant about harboring irrationality is that that is not where their power comes from.  It comes from their ability to attract and focus the energies of billions of individuals which would otherwise be swimming around randomly, cancelling eachother out in petty squabbling.  When you are part of a group (which arguably just means there is enough of an overlap about the things you care about, ie  yacht clubs, fighting deforestation, bingo, jesus christ, salvation by aliens) you give energy into the group and **the entire group** gives energy back to you in exchange, in a self-reinforcing cycle.  Quite remarkable really.  So what is happening is when you challenge the irrationality that a group bases its existence upon, you are challenging an enormous animal.  It is not just one person you have to convince, this is an unfathomably large power network, fighting to reinforce itself.  The recent polarization of the issue, with people like Dawkins coming out and finally challenging the irrationality from an adequate position of power (which [Galileo][galileo] did not have) and the religious responding with escalating vitriol/pleading, is an example of this dynamic.  The telling moment will be when the new philosophy finally renders the archaic one without the ability to supply its members with the necessary amount of ongoing power that the entire thing will collapse like a heap, with the constituents fleeing to any power raft they can find or drown.  Until then, what group are you nourishing?  Is it doing what you want to be doing?  There are other better groups out there, or I should say, there could be more if people would quit wasting their precious energy staring into a screen ignoring the world...  wait...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[nietzsche]: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/\r\n[bgae]: http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/Nietzsche/beyondgoodandevil_tofc.htm\r\n[brun]: http://www.herbertbrun.org/BrunDraw.html\r\n[cell]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cellular_processes\r\n[galileo]: http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/galileo.html","controversiality":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166503864,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37577-8c65dd16-2766-4db0-bda5-d46da707eae5-1566236772"}

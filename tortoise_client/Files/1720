Not much help there).\r\n\r\nSomething badly needs doing in this area, where python is concerned. The simple_install.py scripts are anything but simple if you're behind some kind of firewall / proxy. Similar problems effect [bzr](http://bazaar-vcs.org/) - basically no way to sensibly configure a proxy (with authentication) without hacking the source (of urllib in fact).\r\n\r\nNTLM is tricky, so I'll ignore that.\r\n\r\nBut many companies use just HTTP Basic Proxy Auth and, to me /urllib2?/ is part of the problem - if you delve into the source you'll see it tries to be smart about proxies - on Windows it tries to pull the proxy configuration out of the registry, as it was put their by IE. And most of the time, it just doesn't work, unless you're an avid IE user. Meanwhile it happily ignores anything you put in an environment variable.\r\n\r\nTo me the solution is twofold;\r\n\r\n- stop urllib doing dumb \"magic\" and provoke developers to provide a mechanism for their users to explicitly configure proxies\r\n\r\n- provide a _simple_ API for defining proxy settings - the whole creating handlers business sucks - provide a shortcut\r\n\r\nRant over","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165528442,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"cu1gn","parent_id":"t1_cu14i","author_flair_text":null,"author":"harryf","retrieved_on":1473808030,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14669-ed9bb9f2-e528-4d14-8c2e-2c29e6044eb2-1566236762"}

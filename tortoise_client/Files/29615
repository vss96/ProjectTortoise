You are *obviously* retarded. I *obviously* don't use one for 11 hours a day at work. I'm *obviously* not using one right now.\r\n\r\nMac OS X may look better than Windows, and that's because it's designed better. It's probably not even worth my time to get into the reasons why Windows is a piece of shit, but I'll list the three most recent things that pissed me off about PCs:\r\n\r\n1. I have never wanted to save a file into the folder than contains the application that I used to create it. Why does Homesite default to that?\r\n\r\n2. Why are my desktop icons on different monitors every time I restart my work PC? They seem to stay where I put them on my Macs.\r\n\r\n3. I have 1 GB of ram in this PC and a nearly empty hard drive. Why does it run so low on virtual memory and slow to a crawl every other day or so, yet my the old eMac with less ram and a stuffed hard drive can go for weeks without needing a restart?\r\n\r\nThese things aren't my 'opinion.' And trust me, I'm not the least bit worried about MS beating out apple in \"sex appeal.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, I'm so annoyed by Windows and all the shit it gives me every day, that I'm ready to start using Linux full time at work. Not because it's nicer to look at, but because Windows is such a piece of shit.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ugs5","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808337,"author":"freshyill","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuhoe","parent_id":"t1_cuhhe","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23333-73bc3d1d-c488-49cb-92c1-d354279b4b87-1566236766"}

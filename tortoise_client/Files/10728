Dr. Stevenson was very meticulous in his work:\r\n\r\n&gt;The book contains twenty cases of children who begin to talk about specific memories of them having of a previous life. Dr. Stevenson personally and carefully vetted each to ensure that no other method of obtaining the information was possible for these children.\r\n\r\nThe Wikipedia article contains more information on his particular methods, and then continues to note:\r\n\r\n&gt;Interestingly, very few skeptical criticisms have been made against Dr. Stevenson's work. No peer reviewed authority has published any findings that contradict his work. No skeptical magazine has ever published any critical article on it. While many skeptics of reincarnation in general exist, none have published any opposing hypothesis for this body of work. It has stood unassailed for the first 40 years of the books existence.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vo8v","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44701-d4324f75-d076-4844-9c84-3f9b5e9af499-1566236774"}

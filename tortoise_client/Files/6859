I find most MBAs to be mouth-breathing bufoons whom I can't have a reasonable conversation with unless it revolves around sports, frankly.  I am continually astounded by just how bad some of these guys are, but they can bullshit people and pass the buck to get by, I guess.  I've worked in places where the management team didn't know shit about software development.  \r\n\r\nIn one instance, the company is on its way to dissovling because of it.  Of course they layed off all their developers (passing the buck).  The CEO still drives a fancy BMW, but the office has tons of empty desks now.  Company was *never* profitable.  How long can they live on VC and bullshit?  The clock is winding down...\r\n\r\nI think a big reason why American industry is falling behind is too many MBAs and not enough people with real know-how to do anything worthwhile.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8ho","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55172-5453aca6-acf3-4c47-bd15-831193efc566-1566236779"}

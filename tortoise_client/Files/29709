{"controversiality":0,"body":"You don't need to know anything about James Kim to empathize with a man in this situation.  His wife and children are suffering.  He knows he failed to safeguard them on some level.  They're trying to be brave, but it has been days trapped in a car in the wilderness.  Finally he decides that he will not stay idle yet longer hoping to be discovered.  He decided that his family's survival was more important than his own and that despite the odds he had to try, so he set out alone in the cold.  He died alone in the cold.  \r\n\r\nHave you ever read any Jack London?  This story grabs people because the thought that in the year 2006 something like this happens in the U.S. to smart people with resources is unsettling.  A family road trip in early December ends in tragedy as the brutal and uncaring power of nature is confirmed.  We tend to think that we're the masters of nature, and for good reason, but every now and then we're reminded of our frailty.  Some people seek this experience--anyone watching the series Beyond Everest?--but the Kim family was not.\r\n\r\nI can't recall ever hearing of James Kim before but found myself very interested in his plight.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvxs","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165515645,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":-2,"score":-2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"degustibus","edited":false,"id":"cu0bn","parent_id":"t1_ctw40","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808010,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14203-c8eba549-7891-4745-b084-679c44426bb1-1566236762"}

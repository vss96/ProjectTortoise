Self-reliance, of course, is that which picks up a gun and goes hunting. Social responsibility (through a fraternity or whatever) if it works, comes through preaching interdependence.\r\n\r\nI see no contradiction at all.  I read that as saying that self-reliance was held to be primary: a person should do everything they can to take care of themselves and that there should be shame in having to take charity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, sometimes the world is overwhelming and when a person has stoically done everything they can on their own, then it is time to throw them a lifeline.  The person catching the line should acknowledge that they have failed and that they are receiving a handout.\r\n\r\nThe problem today is that too many people think they are due the hand handout just for being alive without having made every effort to be self-reliant.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167600556,"score":9,"ups":9,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60773-4d97bf51-015c-40bb-b47e-228c11d48bea-1566236780"}

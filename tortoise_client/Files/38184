The brokers sell these zero-down or interest only loans on the premise that their helping less able people buy a home instead of renting.  They become home-owners, have debt leverage capabilities and have an actual hard capital investment that is appreciable.  What the buyer does with that investment (i.e. what it's leveragd for) is up to the buyer and if they're irresponsible with it then it's their own problem.

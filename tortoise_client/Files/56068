{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uukl","body":"Well, interetingly enough - two related articles have come to my attention this morning.  \r\nOne being a [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/us/14tookie.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin) article about the an agitprop re-enactment of the execution of Stan \"Tookie\" Williams, who also apparently took 35 minutes to die, via lethal injection.  The second being an NPR (National Public Radio) segment that I only half caught this morning while getting ready for work.  The part I heard was that for the first time, Americans support giving Life without Parole over the Death Penalty, and that having that sentencing option (which in many states is a relatively new option) is leading more juries away from the Death Penalty.  \r\n\r\nI'm not an American, but I do live here - and while I have my beefs with US society and Government - I do not believe that the society is Barbaric, and to categorize it as such based on the fact that the death penalty still exists is - imho - unfair.  \r\nAnyway, my main point is - I think the tide is slowly changing on the death penalty.  There are a lot of bloodthirsty people that it makes happy, but the majority of people aren't killers and don't want to feel responsible for someone's death, even if it is 27 years in the future - especially when there's an alternative that delivers just as much justice, if not more.  \r\n\r\nAnd in response to your comment about the 27 year - first off, (although I don't support the death penalty), execusion is ostensibly NOT about revenge, but about Justice - and second of all, it often takes that bloody long before all the appeals are worn out.  Which, incidentally, is one of the most compelling arguments AGAINST the death penalty, because it ends up costing the tax payers more money to fund all the years of the appeals process, than to just let the perp rot in jail.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166206062,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuv3q","id":"cuxrv","author":"rraaarr","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808638,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30972-592e89d7-669b-430b-a650-69bb8622c254-1566236769"}

{"body":"On the anecdotal side of the thing...\r\n\r\nI've just read Einstein, with his paper on Brownian movement, put the end to an old controversy between those who believed in small particles (atoms), and those who not. Those who not did say the same than anti string theorists say now: there is no way to know, there is no way to prove that. But Einstein found a way to prove that, and in the future maybe somebody will find a way to prove this too.\r\n\r\n(I'm saying prove, but of course there is no thing like a definitive proof in physics)\r\n\r\nAlso... Feynman used to be a great anti string theory (as anybody else before 1984). I remember a text quoting him on a dialog that went something like this:\r\n\r\nSomeGuy: - But why do you hate string theory that much? Maybe in the future we'll find a prediction it does that we can check...\r\n\r\nFeynman: - A prediction? String theory does already tell a prediction, do you know which one? It says that the world has 10 dimensions; however, this prediction doesn't work with any experimental evidence we can see. So, theorists have to deform the theory so that such prediction doesn't work, for example by folding the extra 6 dimensions. So yes, the theory does a prediction, an only experimental prediction, and it's so wrong you have to hide it!\r\n\r\n(sorry for my bad english)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_wd8g","stickied":false,"subreddit":"science","score":14,"ups":14,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167422876,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"hhm","edited":false,"id":"cwe1r","parent_id":"t3_wd8g","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809633,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57371-d2e1694e-fde4-429a-9cf4-186bc55fb8fe-1566236779"}

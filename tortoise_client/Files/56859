The law is the law, no matter how retarded, and they \"have\" to uphold it.  Now, of course, my personal beliefs are that if a law or a rule is retarded, I shouldn't follow it.  But I'm not in the \"justice\" system.  My, would I make a bad cop or a bad judge.  An appeal was sure to fail - there's no grounds for it.  He did it.  He freely admits to doing it.  But, of course, it shouldn't be a crime!  But, of course, it was.  I really can't stand inflexibility - and any system of \"justice\" and law is just rife with inflexibility.  Justice is blind - and stiff.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166756591,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvpm8","parent_id":"t1_cvnt3","author":"molasses","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809171,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44811-d7b55442-a4af-4950-a562-062c3c09b72e-1566236774"}

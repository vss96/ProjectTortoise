I only spent five weeks in Tanzania but, in that short time, I saw tons of things that could be exported but the government is so used to having their hand out for charity that they don't bother to develop their infastructure, exports, etc.  Tanzania suffered a lot when the sisal market collapsed but there are still large sisal farms but it's not like it used to be.\r\n\r\nWhile I was there, I just kept thinking, \"you could do this\" or \"you could do that\" but the people think, \"why should I?\" the nice Americans, Brits, [insert other nation] will give us money to do it or do it for us.\r\n\r\nI'm not too sure either about putting people out of business.  While I was there I saw many shops that did sell used clothing that was obviously from the USA or Europe but I also saw many tailors' shops and had a few items tailor made for me.  Maybe Tanzania is lucky in that it has the best of both.  You can get cheap used clothes, you can get new clothes and you can get tailored clothes.\r\n\r\nThe main problem I saw, at least in Tanzania, was that the people expected the West to support them when, instead, we should be cutting the apron strings and let them get by on their own.  They have so much to offer but, as long as the West keeps giving them stuff, whether cheap or free, nothing is going to change.","link_id":"t3_vo79","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809161,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"berberine","id":"cvp30","parent_id":"t1_cvp0v","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44560-0daa3aec-314e-47a6-be19-3504671651db-1566236774"}

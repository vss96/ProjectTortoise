Usually someone with an aptitude or desire to learn, but a core compentency which is a + contribution to the bottom line, or lift off.  Motivation.\r\n\r\nB's are everyone else, dead weight, or testers that can be motivated by A's to perform.\r\n\r\nSome A's a tech gurus, but lack social aptitute.  Technically these sub-As need a general coordinator who\r\nunderstand both.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should say some people are  A* and others (technical genius) are As.  The rest are B's.\r\n\r\nSometimes Bs are really As by paradox, they work harder cause they know they are an A but just haven't been \"proven\" in some sense (lack of stimulation, or something)... \r\ne.g. the college drop out who hits it big time.\r\n\r\nWith the competition high from academic ranks.. I see too many super GPAs that can't do basic research or even take a project to market. or even identify a product.  But they can get A on tests.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"427-d08f0bce-21b5-4900-ac02-2c06c503ce99-1566236758"}

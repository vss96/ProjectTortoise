No eight year old \"actress\" even should be made to say what is on that video. The language is disgusting, and the morals being conveyed even through 'acting' are to hate people who do not beleive a certain way. This alone is morally repugnant. That said, I dont for 10 seconds buy that this girl does not believe what she is saying. Truth is I am very much against an eight year old girl playing a part in a movie that is morally repugnant.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u9s2","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808226,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"CarlH","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cubtu","id":"cubtx","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20160-4f073473-9cd4-438a-ada5-2e3e0e53d23e-1566236765"}

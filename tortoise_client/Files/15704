Unfortunately, the word, \"Architect\", has taken on somewhat of a negative connotation in software, although if you look it up, you'll see it has a pretty generic meaning--something along the lines of, \"a person who creates things.\"\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that there are too many people traipsing about, brandishing the name, \"Architect\", when a lot of them are just failed programmers--essentially unqualified.\r\n\r\n\"Real\" architects, meaning the ones who design buildings and bridges, are required to complete a formal certification program before than can legally assume the title. So it actually means something. In software, any schmuck who's slapped together a PHP script can decide he's an architect.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wg1e","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809696,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Bret","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwgtm","id":"cwhf0","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59026-a47a0ec1-a5d5-4a22-880f-5870fc0c124c-1566236780"}

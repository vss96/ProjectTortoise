So the seeming blind eye to what strikes me as  a lawyers wet dream, coupled with the griping about \"the IE problem\", came off a bit Mac fanboi-ish.    \r\n\r\nI don't run Parallels, I don't have a Mac.  I run Ubuntu on a  Dell laptop with 1GB Ram and a 2Ghz CPU.  Using VMWare to run WinXp is not a problem.  For just IE, I run it more-or-less directly using Wine.    No issues whatsoever. IE is no more a resource hog than, say, Firefox.\r\n\r\nI'm not looking to defend IE, but maybe the issue really *is* with Parallels.\r\n\r\nAnd you should get that adapter looked at.\r\n\r\n;)","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50656-187ee078-70cb-496e-b741-46b5d19eed91-1566236778"}

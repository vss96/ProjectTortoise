{"body":"I think it's a mistake by Wikipedia mods, frankly. Not too long ago they tried to get rid of the Kenneth Pinyan(sp?) entry because they thought it \"wasn't notable\". I mean, come on... if Wikipedia isn't there to tell us about Mr. Hands, people will have to find and watch the video (ewwwww).\r\n\r\nIf I want only respectable and notable facts, I'll use encyclopedia brittanica. If I want the latest information, or look up something too esoteric to be in EB, I will go to wikipedia. If wikipedia suddenly decide that they're too good to carry the esoteric stuff that is the foundation of its popularity, then frankly fsck wikipedia. It's no longer useful the way it used to be.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tfak","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165187311,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"cthkn","parent_id":"t3_tfak","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807660,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5547-4a981948-94e7-4293-9ad0-a6f156f63426-1566236759"}

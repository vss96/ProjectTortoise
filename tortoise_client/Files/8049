Of course, the problem with social intelligence is that, despite its value, if it was all we had, we'd still be sitting around the fire in our pelts sporting wooden clubs. The same situation if you take away everything (cities, transportation, Internet, ...) that men have invented and built, using their \"manly\" intelligence. Of course I agree we'd have a good time around the camp fire, before we'd starve to death. Notice I use this example because biologically for the human species it's known that most males conform to the hunters role and the females the tenders. Your response fits perfectly. We need both to be succesful, so there you have it.","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3142-5c514100-7d65-407b-8b9f-15f9e851c05a-1566236759"}

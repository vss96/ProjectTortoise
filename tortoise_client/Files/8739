Would it not tend to antagonise the police and their authorities, and thus make them more defensive?  Would they then modify their behaviour towards keeping such practices more secretive?  Or... would the government itself then outlaw completely any forms of citizen surveillance upon the police or any other bodies of authority, and simply incarcerate any transgressors for very long periods to 'get them out of the way'?\r\n\r\nWhat I am seeking is perhaps a different angle on the situation... possibly a more comprehensive analysis of the various 'checks and balances' in the system, in order to discern areas where some forms of incentives or modified goals could be enacted to steer the situation towards a more positive direction.  Such, of course, would imply a similar modification of governmental stance on the issue as well.\r\n\r\nThe true 'bottom line' of course, is: *could* the direction be modified?  Or - is it possibly too late already?","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808774,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv4wp","id":"cv4yr","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34382-27d9d0bb-9997-4075-a59f-3f6b3142d569-1566236771"}

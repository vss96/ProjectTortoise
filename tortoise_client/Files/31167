After applying the mask and limiting what I could see to only the two squares of interest, the colors were optically similar enough for me to say they are the \"same\". The actual numbers on the colors are: top center square R=130 G=70 B=51, side center square R=126 G=71 B=18. Ok, I'm a guy and the slight movement in R and G means nothing to me and even the larger movement in B when combined with RG doesn't really affect my perception much with my stunted male cones (retina). Also, fyi, the compression artifacts were just too bothersome so I averaged the colors by gausian bluring the center squares (they were cut out and on their own layer to eliminate bleeding from adjacent squares. So, ballparking it, I say WOW for two squares that look so totally different when all the rods and cones are being stimulated in my retina to them being essentially the same when all the other colors are not confusing my retina, optic nerve and the big photoshop in the back of my brain, well, I'm impressed.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807447,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ct67t","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t1z0","author":"rickvg","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"210-cf54ba0e-8c6a-4d04-bf17-002c04731428-1566236758"}

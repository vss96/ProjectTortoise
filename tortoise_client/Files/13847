{"controversiality":0,"body":"Wow, did you misconstrue the hell out of that one.  I'm not equating atheists with fringe psycho muslim fundamentalists.  I'm equating fringe psycho atheists with fringe psycho muslim fundamentalists.\r\n\r\n&gt;the Atheists who unilaterally condemn all religion as if it were made up solely of fundies\r\n\r\nI don't see how I could have been more clear.  Not all atheists.  Just those who blah blah blah...\r\n\r\n&gt;Oh yeah, the everybody-does-it-argument.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean here, what part of my post might cause you to say it, or what part of your post builds on it.  It looks like you started to post one thing and then changed your mind, but left the first sentence in.\r\n\r\n&gt;committing acts of terrorism, killing doctors, knocking on your door, or telling you that you will rot in hell, etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, these are the things the fringe psychos do.\r\n\r\n&gt;Atheists condemn all religion because its crap\r\n\r\nNo.  Unthinking, blindly hateful, *fringe psychos* do.  Atheists *disagree* with religion \"because it's crap\" (usually the non-fringe-psycho ones (I'm seriously doubting that you are not a fringe psycho) can word it a *tad* more eloquently though).  I disagree with people who say that 'Life' cereal is better than 'Cinnamon Life'.  But I don't condemn the cereal, or it's fans.  I just don't care for it, and I can't see why anybody would.\r\n\r\nRe: \"Literalist\": I used the word to separate the two extremes of *religious* believers mentioned by the posts I was replying to.  Reading back I can see how it appears I meant the term to apply to Atheists.  My apologies.  Just go back through and replace all instances of 'literalist\\*' with 'fundamentalist / fringe psycho'.\r\n\r\n&gt;Rush\r\n\r\nWhat's that?\r\n\r\n&gt;Weekly Standard\r\n\r\nWhat's that?\r\n\r\n&gt;WSJ-editorial-page\r\n\r\nI'm sure I've read this before, but not often and not without being given a link.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v6h2","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166468320,"author":"oditogre","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cv8ic","id":"cv91n","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808851,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36412-06be8042-2d96-4fa3-9c23-2e90cafe178d-1566236772"}

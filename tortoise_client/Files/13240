It seems quite nice for the company, as if they don't like a consultant, they don't have to fire him or anything, just hire someone else.  The company gets what they want without all the overhead.\r\n\r\nIf it's a worse deal for anyone, it would seem to be the consultant, who has to go and find work himself, do his own marketing, taxes, health care, etc, and still doesn't have a steady income.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tksu","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7941-fd05380c-3f6f-4e81-8c8c-e2cba71fef03-1566236760"}

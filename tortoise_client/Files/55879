One verse says God will not burden you beyond what you can bear, while another says we should help our brothers with their burdens.  Do you see the contradiction, it's clear.  But look at how the language is a blessing to both parties.  The first person with the burden knows that in the midst of his suffering there will be deliverance, he may not think that he has the strength or see where it's coming from, but he trusts in the promise of God.  For the person who is outside, the brother, he sees the one who is suffering and his instruction is to aid, to share his strength and blessings.  There are many occasions like this.\r\n\r\nI used to have great difficulty with a verse in the bible instructing us to have respect for the government, and pray for the leaders, because they were placed their to punish the ungodly.  Now knowing what governments have done, from the holocaust to slavery I would wonder how in the world are you to say with a straight face that we should respect government.  But this was just me being argumentative.  Ther are obviously other verses that say we are to serve God before man, so we are not to go so far in respecting the govt. that we don't serve God. But on a surface reading we find contradiction.  This is what I mean by apparent inconsistency.\r\n\r\nIf one were to approach the bible in order to write a code of conduct one would be hopelessly lost, it is far too nuanced for that.\r\n\r\nWhen the woman by the well came to Jesus and asked, where should we worship?  Jesus said a new time has come, it's not about the law, where you should worship, and what you should eat, and whether or not you should turn your cheek, he said the time is come to worship in SPIRIT and truth.  SPIRIT comes first, if there is no spirit then there can be no worship, and that book becomes just another playing field for intellectual contests.\r\n\r\nMy point is not your defeat, and my point is certainly not to argue theology.  My point is simply that the bible should not be used incorrectly it's not a rule book to point out to people that they are right or wrong.  And I don't care how many \"christians\" use it in this fashion, it doesn't make it right.\r\n\r\nThe bible is a book about God, and if you don't have faith in God it is impossible to serve him or know him.  You are not goin to find him in the bible.  Jesus said to the religious people of the day, you search these books day and night but you don't recognize ME!  When all these books do is talk about ME!  If you don't know God, I find your attempts to get something out of the bible sadly laughable.","link_id":"t3_v1y6","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37225-40af4978-fb82-49f2-8686-6557dd3b6a22-1566236772"}

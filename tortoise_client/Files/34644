I really like the philosophers at the helm of it--stoics everyone, especially Craig himself. It is worth pointing out, that the people using it are _not_ philosophers. You know, everytime somebody places an ad on Craigslist, advertising an apartment, job, product, service, etc, that person is trying to maximize his personal profit. If Craig doesn't want his fair share--his for the asking--fine. It's great that Craig is so interested in _my_ and _others_ sense of greed rather than his own.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808334,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuh46","id":"cuhiw","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mynameishere","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23257-f94acc5b-dcd9-4724-9954-93d3a7f601d0-1566236766"}

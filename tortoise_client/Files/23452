Especially when using (non-Maya) Native American actors and filming the whole thing in the Maya language?  It contributes to a pretense of authenticity that is wholly undeserved.  Native peoples have been used this way by storytellers for hundreds of years; people project whatever qualities they wish onto them for the sake of an allegory concerned with and directed at Western peoples, with little or no regard for what the group's actual culture and history may be.  I'm similarly bothered, by the way, by Sascha Baron Cohen's use of Kazakhstan for the sake of commentary about the U.S. and Britain.  Why not make up a fictional country for this kind of narrative, instead of using a real one inaccurately?","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v7ms","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166467922,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36397-72c5acfa-2922-4944-a6e0-d4351cdba847-1566236772"}

Surely they have them. Maybe Nintendo didn't want to throw off consumers by launching the system with a bunch of different colors? Or maybe they just wanted to hold it off to keep the buzz generating come 07.\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother theory here...\r\n\r\nLet's say the U.S. gets the DVD wii version shipped, as is already confirmed for Japan. Let's say they get it around Spring 07...\r\n\r\nSurely they don't want the Wii to cost 300 bucks for the dvd version, do they? When you start approaching the $300 mark, you'll be competing with a 360 at that point. I say so, because I would assume by Q2 of next year 360 will see a price drop... it'll be around by nearly a year and a half by then.\r\n\r\nIf they can get the Wii down to 200, then they can sell the DVD version for 250. This way, they can still appeal to the casual crowd by selling even the DVD version relatively cheap.\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808615,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cuwki","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uwkh","author_flair_text":null,"author":"deL1GHT","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30408-38fbf8a7-f6c3-4146-ac56-aa193e98f7d7-1566236769"}

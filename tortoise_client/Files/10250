Buddhist after Buddhas demise became more and more ritualistic. They tried to transform themselves into a religion rather than a way of life. A very popular thing among buddhists was to spread their religion and that was becasue they continued Buddhas tradition of going out and helping people. But as they transformed themselves into a religion in later centuries Buddism became the first and the original proselytizing religion. Then their main goal became just to add numbers to their religion. The best tool they discovered was to get the local king on their side and then use him to get numbers.\r\n\r\nBuddhists became corrupt due to this mixing with politics on one side, and to impress less intelligent people, very ritualistic on the other side. They became to difficult for a common man on the street. Then the worst thing happened, they started dividing themselves among hundreds of different sects based on rituals and beliefs. These different denominations would scheme against each other and to remain in business became more and more ritualistic / corrupt and difficult. \r\n\r\nThey lost their originality and direction. And the man on the street could not longer understand them. Also, with the kind of austerity, high disciplin and non-entertaining emphasis; too difficut. At this point Hinduism resurged as a lesser ritualist and easier religion. Hindusim is not hedonistic but allows for enjoying sex, meat, wine, drugs. Religious rituals are less of a disciplin and more of an entertainment. And makes philosophical aspect easier for the illitrate/semi-litrate/non-philosophical bent minded people. And then Brahmins priests played a very important role by being highly flexible to cater to the religious customers.\r\n\r\nI think, this is the natural lifecycle of anything. Islam brought so many good things for the people of its times. Christianty did that too. Buddhism did that too. And slowly they lost their original goal as they supercede it. Like Mohammad had welfare of women and slaves as high priority on his mind. The level of welfare he thought was a huge target when compared to the reality of his time. But as the target has been achieved, we need a new Islam to go forward. The period of this changeover is very painful. Most likely, we all through out the world need a new religion to take us forward. It seems the time of a kind of Buddhism is again in and in future centuries they are going to dominate agian and for good.","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41887-dc7a3d8b-baf3-4a3e-b4eb-7ca7776c6de4-1566236774"}

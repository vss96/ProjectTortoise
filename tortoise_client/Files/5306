{"body":"First of all, I never mentioned Haskell in my last comment. You just assumed that I was attacking Haskell. For that you owe me an apology. \r\n\r\nMoreover, you have actually lost a good opportunity to promote Haskell. Instead of making it personal, you could have simply said \"Haskell doesn't suffer from that flaw\" or \"Many FP languages, including Haskell, are not purely immutable\".\r\n\r\nA lot of people think the same way about functional languages as I do. If you consider this to be an opportunity to correct the misunderstanding in a polite and professional fashion, you add to the reputation of the community you support. If, on the other hand, you are rude or don't listen to the concerns expressed by the people you don't agree with, you make your community appear to be arrogant and out of touch with the real world.\r\n\r\n&gt; your mistaken impression about the lack of mutable state in Haskell comes from the common sentiment in the community that mutable state is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nTrue, but can you really fault me for that? Countless people have told me how great Haskell is because it doesn't have mutable state. Why should I believe otherwise?\r\n\r\nIf I were to consider only the sheer number of voices, I would have to accuse you of not knowing what you were talking about. But as you have provided specific counter examples, I do trust you.\r\n\r\nOf course, this leads to the follow-up question of why so many people claim that Haskell doesn't have mutable state.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_u5jo","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":-7,"ups":-7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165689508,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"grauenwolf","parent_id":"t1_cu8yp","id":"cu96z","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808177,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18770-4d66c6c6-3541-4a48-a769-ba0f24bea55a-1566236764"}

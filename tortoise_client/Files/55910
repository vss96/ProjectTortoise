(1) The relevancy of the amendment is not for the courts to decide; if it is no longer relevant, there is a mode prescribed in the constitution to amend the defect.  (2) Did you bother to read the the site you linked to, or do you have any understanding of the historical reasoning behind the amendment in question?  I quote, from the page you give,\r\n\r\n&gt;Another source of power in government is a military force. But this, to be efficient, must be superior to any force that exists among the people, or which they can command; for otherwise this force would be annihilated, on the first exercise of acts of oppression. Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretence, raised in the United States\r\n\r\nThe premise is that the government is not to be feared so long as the people can reasonably be expected to rise up in rebellion and crush any standing army they throw at them.  Have the circumstances so changed that we no longer need to fear the gradual or sudden encroachment of our liberties by government?

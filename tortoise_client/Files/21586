They're still expensive since they use lots of glass (for mirrors) but not as high-purity as silicon obviously. Still, novel technologies will ideally be developed that can reflect light.\r\n\r\nThere's a patent out there that does the following, if you could imagine a roof covered in microbeads which are transparent and have a mirror in the middle of them. These beads would then have a charge on one side so they have a polarity. Then, if these beads were rotatable, you could control their orientation based on small electric fields in a grid throughout the surface... the idea being, you could move the beads throughout the day in a way to optimize the amount of light that gets concentrated onto a small, high-efficiency detector that would be far too expensive to cover a large area with.\r\n\r\nPatents like this, and others, show that there is much thinking going on in these fields, and as advancements with micro and nano-fabrication move forward, and large-scale thin-film printing becomes commonplace, we will almost surely be able to GREATLY improve our solar efficiency and economic bottom line on the issue.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tywe","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","created_utc":1165542750,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":3,"score":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15077-df36fe21-74d2-4f14-ab06-c345f47ce143-1566236762"}

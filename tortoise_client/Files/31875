Practitioners of a field invent terms to help express the structure of their ideas, just like programmers invent functions to express the structure of their programs.\r\n\r\nThere are some cases where people do invent needless complexity.  The Microsoft example is very apt.  But researchers in academia -- good researchers -- do not fall into this category because they benefit largely from wider understanding of their ideas.\r\n\r\nBut to express these, it sometimes takes specialized language, or else the explanation expands to be incomprehensible even to the knowledgable.  Researchers can't expect to have to hand-hold people through every paper.\r\n\r\nWith my background, names like `map`, `filter`, and `fold` are very natural.  It is a rather strange thing to assume that everyone comes from the narrow-minded C# database programming flock.  And I sure hope he doesn't really think `fold` is the same thing as \"aggregate.\"\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_wa1q","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809572,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ricercar","id":"cwat6","parent_id":"t3_wa1q","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55741-2b8cf6c6-296f-443b-b1e8-6d3ea8cc5145-1566236779"}

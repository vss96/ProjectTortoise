{"controversiality":0,"body":"Perhaps you should show code.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about this for a while. I can't help the suspicion that certain kinds of programs would seem unnatural with monads. But I haven't seen anyone convincingly articulate that particular case.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's not so much about a specific *static* program as a *dynamic* trajectory of program evolution that becomes harder with haskell. My conclusion so far is to use python or ruby for prototyping, then to convert to haskell with a clear design and type vocabulary in hand.","link_id":"t3_w79v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167380375,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"akkartik","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwc8i","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwb5r","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809599,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56455-3970401f-ffa5-4c63-8645-a16e375315e0-1566236779"}

I don't think an atheist can reach the same spiritual experience as a religious person, Christian, Hindu or other. \r\n\r\nThe way I see it is: atheists tend to trust their reasoning and senses mostly while religious people (or truly spiritual people at least) tend to value some kind of inner experience that is very hard to put into words. That inner experience is their source of truth while atheists dismiss it as mumbo-jumbo.\r\n\r\nBoth science and religion cannot fully explain the universe, life and higher consciousness.\r\n","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx5n","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809328,"author":"visarga","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vx5n","id":"cvxwv","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49005-c6746a95-55f8-4af6-bfd1-88cee4312c6d-1566236777"}

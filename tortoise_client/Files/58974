On a piano, you'll be playing a lot of black keys, but you can basically just shift your hand position a half step.  On a guitar, you just tune to Eb and play as if it were in D.  On a harp, as the article mentioned, you just put all the pedals down.\r\n\r\nWith classical bowed string instruments (violins, violas, and cellos), it is indeed a bitch.  I don't know any pieces that are in C# major, other than little show-off pieces.  I don't know enough about wind or brass instruments to comment.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ucvh","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20788-e288c1a1-7097-458e-9cb3-7b17517ffe73-1566236765"}

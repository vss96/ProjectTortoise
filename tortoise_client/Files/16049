Didn't really work, at least for this one-hit thing. He made a bunch of small mistakes and phrased things poorly, so the lecture would stop for a minute while we argued over whether he was actually lying or not.\r\n\r\nThen, in the end, the lie turned out to be really lame (we did as part of the lecture the classic laser-and-mirrors measurement of the speed of light, which he claimed was a lie since the speed of light is a primary standard and so we were actually measuring the length of our meter stick).\r\n\r\nThen again, he was a pretty bad lecturer in most other respects anyway, so maybe he just didn't pull it off well. In a long, \"boring\" class like the one this prof teaches, it sounds like it would work much better -- particularly with his no-lie lecture gimmick.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wbx5","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809599,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"w0073r","id":"cwc8b","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wbx5","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56453-a7cbba5c-702c-49fe-a8ff-5e376641ac79-1566236779"}

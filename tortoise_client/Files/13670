(I'm assuming that there is an ESS with the %s in the article).\r\n\r\nI'd argue something like this: suppose you have a community of only growers.  A single shower appears.  If females of the species judge who they want to mate with on size they may choose the shower and hence shower genes will spread through the community quickly.  \r\n\r\nConsider now a world of only showers.  They each run a risk of damage to the penis, which being long and exposed could get damaged.  A grower runs a lower risk and hence grower genes could slowly increase in a population (assuming that grower gets to mate at least once) as some of the showers get damaged.\r\n\r\nI assume at some point there's an equilibrium reached.\r\n\r\nJohn.\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808843,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_v5hk","id":"cv8q0","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36243-26630caf-eb8e-4954-a076-257607ef5fb4-1566236772"}

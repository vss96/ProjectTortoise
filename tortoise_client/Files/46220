In fact, it worked great.  \r\n\r\nOne other interesting side effect:  The battery pack on your belt would charge a small internal battery so you could swap belts.  My dad said, I've never been so quick to swap belts in my life.\r\n\r\nHe loved freaking out folks by having them take his pulse.\r\n\r\nAnticipating the likely question: He was only using one of these hearts temporarly (about a year) until a transplant could be located.  He had the transplant, but died about a year later in the shower due to a reaction to the antirejection drugs he was taking.  The quality of life with the mechanical heart was way higher than he ever had with the transplant.\r\n\r\nI miss him.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ux5e","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808646,"distinguished":null,"author":"punkgeek","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ux5e","id":"cuyah","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31233-64ba55a1-e0f9-407e-ad48-2e66af21f4e7-1566236769"}

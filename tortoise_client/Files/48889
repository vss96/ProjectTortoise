Like \"though\".\r\n\r\n&gt;Your \"he said his comments could be published at any time after his death\" != \"he said his comments could be published only at any time after his death\" is the most asinine argument I've ever heard.\r\n\r\nGood lord.\r\n\r\n&gt;Consider these examples:\r\n\r\n&gt;\"You may have dessert after dinner\" \"You can come after 6pm\" \"Your check can be picked up on Thursday or later\"\r\n\r\nAll of those sentences are similar to \"you can publish after my death\" in the sense of \"you can only publish after my death\".\r\n\r\n*None* of them are similar to what was actually said, which you consistently refuse to quote in full.\r\n\r\n&gt;In regard to the \"though\".

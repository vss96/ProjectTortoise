(For example, we have 40 hour workweeks, though of course in reality people work longer.)\r\n\r\nThis is a completely separate point from the rest of the post, and should probably have been given its own post rather than edited in since it would have influenced how I worded my own response.\r\n\r\nI'll respond here:\r\n\r\nSomething like a forty hour workweek law is in no way related to capitalism or the need for a minimal state to ensure that a free market is not derailed by voluntary associations that get out of hand.  There's no need to protect people from \"the worst consequences of capitalism\": what's needed is to protect people from those who try to game the system or otherwise introduce coercive influences into the system.  That is not strictly related to property rights, by most definitions, but it is also not particularly related to a law establishing an arbitrary number of hours for the standard work week, either.\r\n\r\n&gt; I expect you can find a good deal of anarchist literature on post-state systems, or ones where the role of the state is fundamentally transformed. Like corporations, nation-states are artificial entities, and cause serious problems.\r\n\r\nI've read a good deal of such literature.  I have, for instance, \"In Defense of Anarchy\" on a bookshelf.  That doesn't change the fact that, short of some kind of species-wide Enlightenment, an anarchic system that doesn't fall over in the first stiff wind is unlikely to the point of absurdity -- at least in my estimation.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165949185,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25316-05f3f0eb-1347-45d1-89bf-c1ccfaa79ca5-1566236767"}

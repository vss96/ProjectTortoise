{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; \"Of course money was a factor,\" he said at the sentencing. \"But if I didn't have a drug problem, I wouldn't need to be pursuing money illegitimately.\" .... [Defense lawyer] Hayes said his client \"chose to self-medicate with marijuana\" because of Lyme Disease contracted at a young age.\r\n\r\nHuh? His drug problem caused him to pursue money illegitimately? Like the 400K in the gym bag? Or the $X00K he expected to profit? Can't he just shoplift Nike crap like a normal tweaker?\r\n\r\nAnd 400 pounds? Just how bad is his Lyme disease? \r\n\r\nBlimey, his lawyer should get 20 years for aggravated bullshitting.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uyez","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166229056,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":24,"ups":24,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"anonymous-coward","id":"cuzcu","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uyez","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808668,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31762-04dc9061-1560-47ff-83aa-159aa0a684b1-1566236770"}

{"body":"Oh, spare me.\r\n\r\nFlynt Leverett is part of a faction in the US government.  The CIA is part of another faction.  The White House is a third faction.  The New York Times is probably best considered a fourth.\r\n\r\nThe idea that factions (a), (b) and (d) are somehow bravely standing up against the oppressive censorship of faction (c) is pure nonsense.  If anything, (a), (b) and (d) are probably more powerful than (c).  In fact, either (a) or (d) probably has more influence individually than (c).\r\n\r\nWhich doesn't make any of them right or wrong or whatever.  It just means you have to look at the actual facts.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe the actual facts show that Assad and Ahmadinejad get most of their political power from opposing Washington, and I see no motivation at all for them to come to an agreement with it.\r\n\r\nMr. Leverett disagrees.  And that is his right.  But let him convince you with his arguments - not with this idiotic Beltway-Byzantine BS.","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_vq1i","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166817943,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvs42","parent_id":"t3_vq1i","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809218,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46043-9398e858-26cc-4d4b-9e99-73d92ecb06ea-1566236775"}

There was an unexplained severe service outage at about 5:30pm south between Bloor and Union Stations (Dundas Station is roughly midway between the two).  There were emergency personnel everywhere in Bloor Station redirecting people to other subway lines.\r\n\r\nNormal service outages are usually just announced over the intercom as a power outage or medical emergency.  This time there were TTC staff and personnel swarming everywhere.  I assumed it was a terrorist attack response but there was no news coverage the next day (unfortunately I didn't watch the news that night).\r\n\r\nNormal subway suicides are collision injuries resulting in just a broken body, but this one appeared to be extra gory, which may explain the extra emergency measures.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t8jy","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807511,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"kermityfrog","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct94q","id":"ct9o6","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1915-124dbc3e-3c33-4b22-8419-c1da9aa2676e-1566236758"}

If they don't want to create ugly surprises they simple have to use a new syntax.\r\n\r\nJava always tried to went they way of 'no surprises' by making as much as possible explicit. They left this way by creating auto-boxing/unboxing, which was IMO a really bad idea, even it it is quite convenient. \r\n\r\nIt's a good idea to avoid the same mistake for properties: In the moment if you read 'x.blah' you know that it is a cheap operation because no complex computation can happen. \r\n\r\nBut if they allow to use the '.'-syntax for properties, something like 'x.blah' could start computations which may take seconds. Also think of the possible issues with synchronization. To avoid this creating a new syntax (even a ugly one) is the only solid way.\r\n\r\nAnd remember that I'm only talking in the context of Java here, it's a different thing for other languages.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wcxk","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57185-d39fb046-4588-444a-9da0-d6598df093a7-1566236779"}

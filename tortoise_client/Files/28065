You'll also notice that I home educate (in addition to working with \"troubled\" children.)  You'd also notice that I support and advocate the educational theory of directed autonomy.  I believe children have rights.  I believe they should make choices. (Lots and lots of them...how else will they learn?)  However - at no point would I permit a child the \"choice\" of destroying their life or to make life endangering choices.  The best thing we can do for children is to find the balance between encouraging exploration; being the safety net for when they fail their challenges and being the cheerleading squad when they succeed. \r\n\r\nBut - we must provide for some amount of structure and offer challenges and explorations that are developmentally age appropriate. Should I let the toddler stir the soup just because he wants to...perhaps...with a lot of supervision.  Should I let him do it \"all by self?\"  Absolutely not! Should I let the teenager's boyfriend sleep over?  Why not, as long as she demonstrates responsibility and meaningful knowledge of safe sex.  \r\n\r\nNobody just has \"rights.\"  The ability to exercise your rights comes with responsibility.  And if they demonstrate that they are unable to make the right choices - we have the obligation to help them remember what those are.  We are their parents.  That is our *job* - and the State can put us in prison for doing it so poorly that someone else has take responsibility for our failures.  \r\n\r\nThen again - when I was what I am guessing your age is...somehere between 15 and 18...I felt the same way.  Then I grew up and had children. :)","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_twhc","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13500-616f7ecd-75bb-4e2c-b875-d92146f18e97-1566236762"}

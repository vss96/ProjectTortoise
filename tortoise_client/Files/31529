Whether they are a better filter than task-specific questions (or task-specific questions combined with logic problems) is open to question however.  Note that even a filter that rejects some good candidates can still be better than the alternatives if it does a better job at seperating the other good candidates from the chaff.\r\n\r\nIf you would really act as you describe, then eliminating you is probably a sign of the filtering process working well.  If you're not prepared to invest that much effort into the interview how much do you really want the job?  Similarly you've indicated a reluctance to work outside the letter of your job specification - definitely a disadvantage for your employer.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ueqk","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1165928111,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"Brian","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuk7j","parent_id":"t1_cuibq","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808384,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24630-ccdaf642-f26a-48fe-a963-af92702957f7-1566236767"}

To whose\r\n&gt; benefit? Who would gain from the poisoning of Litvinenko?\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; What benefit could Putin conceivably realize from the \r\n&gt; London killing of an enemy of his regime, who had just \r\n&gt; become a British citizen? Why would the Russian president,\r\n&gt;  at the peak of his popularity, with his regime awash in \r\n&gt; oil revenue and himself playing a strong hand in world \r\n&gt; politics, risk a breach with every Western nation by \r\n&gt; ordering the public murder of a man who was more of a \r\n&gt; nuisance than a threat to his regime?\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Yet, listening to some Western pundits on the BBC and Fox \r\n&gt; News, one would think Putin himself poisoned Litvinenko. \r\n&gt; Who else, they ask, could have acquired polonium-210, the \r\n&gt; rare radioactive substance used to kill Litvinenko? Who \r\n&gt; else had the motive to eliminate the ex-agent who had \r\n&gt; dedicated his life to exposing the crimes of the Kremlin?\r\n&gt; \r\n\r\nI like the smell of propaganda in the morning.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807663,"gilded":0,"id":"cthoj","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tg8t","author":"charodey","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5592-1bd56629-0f8a-4fd0-9b04-effde833ee08-1566236759"}

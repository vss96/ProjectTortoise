{"controversiality":0,"body":"I've read far stupider.\r\n\r\nBut, as is parrotted time and time again:\r\n\r\n\"correlation is not causation\"\r\n\r\nBeing short is correlated with having a shorter inseam on your pants leg.\r\n\r\nBeing American is correlated with being overweight.\r\n\r\nBeing white is correlated with income.\r\n\r\nBeing male is correlated with income.\r\n\r\nThe simple statistical correlation that \"income in america is highly correlated with IQ\" means only that. It doesn't mean low IQ *causes* low income, or that low income *causes* low IQ. It means that, on average, people with lower IQ *tend* to have lower income, and that, on average, people with lower income tend to have lower IQ.\r\n\r\nBut it's all bullshit, starting with the \"IQ\" test in the first place; the stacked house of cards that is wealth (the more you have, the easier it is to get more; the less you have, the harder it is to get more); etc.\r\n\r\nThe source (pica) is what is wrong with the statement. We naturally *imply* that what pica *means* is that one causes the other -- but, careful, that's not actually what that statement says.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t66j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1164989979,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"sblinn","parent_id":"t1_ct8ee","id":"ct8ns","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807492,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1377-231bb84d-7a68-4b84-ba2c-41c79c63c136-1566236758"}

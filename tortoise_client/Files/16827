Real feminism, of course, is the fight for equality - the fight to make people realize women have as much worth, personality, and ability as men (though, of course, usually in different ways than men - equal does not mean *same*).  Which is what, I think, electromagnetic was saying.  Kinda.  Maybe.\r\n\r\nOh, and may I just say that I am very amused that this has gone from a discussion about gooooooooooooooogle to a discussion about feminism?","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165272896,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctmdb","parent_id":"t1_ctio3","author_flair_text":null,"author":"molasses","retrieved_on":1473807749,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7755-b456129f-cd78-40ef-ba93-de14393d9e69-1566236760"}

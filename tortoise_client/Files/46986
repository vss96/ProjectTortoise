Sc., by doing manual divisions when no calculator was around (a rare occurence, I gotta admit). \"Shit man, you remember how to do that ?\" Slower than with a calculator, but most of times faster than FINDING one.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I knew there was a way for square roots to be found manually, I just never took the time to look it up.

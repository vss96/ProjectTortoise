Some would even argue that it would have been better if they hadn't. As instead of a defeat for Germany, we would have had a draw. Which could have been a good thing. \r\n\r\nBritain got a lot of assistance from the US during the Second World War, but it was not free. For a start, ever wondered how the US has managed to get so many military bases scattered across the world? \r\n\r\nFor the Cold War, Churchill reputedly commented \"We killed the wrong pig\" in reference to Hitler, and proposed that Germany was rearmed and fought alongside the allies to push the Russians back out of Europe. Our allies weren't so sure.\r\n\r\nAll of the above points have counter arguments to them, but I just want to raise the idea that there are many angles to these situations.\r\n\r\nSo where would we be without the US to protect us, who knows? You can not rewrite history. Where would the US be without Europe? It wouldn't exist.\r\n\r\nEurope and US are inextricably linked. They owe each other really, but tend to bicker quite a lot like brothers and sisters ;)","link_id":"t3_tk2b","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6952-d349304b-71cc-42be-ba46-c71377faf59f-1566236760"}

{"body":"I tend to stick with PHP5, Postgresql, MySQL. I'm not really all that excited to have to learn a new langauge and new syntax.

Granted i haven't had to use any database abstraction layers, but come on guy's how often in the startup world assuming you use OSS do you switch databases, if anything you get more intimate with the one you started out with. If you used good programing practices, it shouldn't be too difficult to break out of your shell for which ever database you used.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w0ju","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":-4,"ups":-4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167104603,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"compubomb","edited":false,"id":"cw0ym","parent_id":"t3_w0ju","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809385,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50552-50832895-a194-4f82-a152-743c603da6b4-1566236778"}

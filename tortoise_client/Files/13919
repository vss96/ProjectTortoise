A medium-large project whose requirements are a moving target in Python is doomed if you don't write good unit tests, enough documentation to ensure it's clear what the args to your APIs are, and use tools like pylint and pychecker religiously.  The language doesn't hold your hands on this stuff or provide much feedback on mistakes except at runtime.\r\n\r\nC#/Java and their static typed variables force some of these practices on you.  No matter what the documentation, you're forced to provide a variable of the proper type to any method call or else your program doesn't run.  Essentially foolproof refactoring tools are possible- in Java/Eclipse, you don't even really have to be careful about changing the arguments of a method, it takes all of 5 seconds, and you see exactly where things are broken.\r\n\r\nC# and Java make it possible for just about any idiot to write code on a large project that runs and mostly works.  That's pretty commendable.  Note that I'm not suggesting all such programmers are dumb, I know some really smart code ninjas working in the Java world.\r\n\r\nIn Python you can get burned if you're not careful.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vr55","subreddit":"programming","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1166819152,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46094-7e4dd846-dd4a-41bf-9bad-d254f004aba9-1566236775"}

This would encourage employees to show up at naturally buy times of the day or week, and avoid times that most employees like to work. It probably wouldn't work for employees just to show up and leave whenever they felt like it, but they could maybe sign up for time slots up to a day or two in advance, and if managers felt that a shift would be understaffed they could offer bonus pay over those shifts (to everyone, not just late signups).\r\n\r\nOf course this system could be gamed, as clerks would be incentivized to provide fast but possibly unhelpful service, but managers could probably keep that from happening just by keeping an eye on things.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10735-6c2396e8-d2c6-41b6-8728-a574fbf82633-1566236761"}

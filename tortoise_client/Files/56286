Children aren't liable and there's also a legally defined threshold for the 'mentally disadvantaged' precisely for this reason. \r\n\r\nAs I see it, this isn't an abusive practise but a logical and predictable consequence of how much freedom these markets are granted. It's a real-world common sense example of how free markets are far from an optimum solution to maintaining the kind of reasonably equitable and stable society that most people would choose to live in. While that doesn't answer the important question of what precisely would be better, it should tell a reasonable person that the mystical zeal and pseudo-scientific dogma that often surrounds free-market orthodoxy (e.g. the more literal-minded proponents of the Austrian school) can be disastrous if allowed to guide policy.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807492,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ct8o5","parent_id":"t1_ct6th","author":"chu","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1383-011d7761-79ed-4a55-94dd-b9ecd0196d01-1566236758"}

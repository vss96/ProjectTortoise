{"controversiality":0,"body":"Greek Salad is commonly available in mega-grocery-box-stores (Publix in FL), and complementary products are available at popular fast-food chains (McDonalds' Asian Salad) at nearly the same price so (2) is common to both Burritos and Greek Salad. I mentioned (3) and completely agree. While I'm sure the meat used in unhealthy Burritos is sub-par, (1) isn't necessarily a fact since it's very subjective. I'm sure they cut every corner but if it tastes good, people don't care about (1).\r\n\r\nWhat I meant overall was that if the demand rises for good food, 1), 2), 3) will apply to healthier foods instead of the unhealthier foods. I don't want the highest grade apples. I'll be fine with slightly misshapen (disease-free) apples. Just give me Greek Salad at $2 by applying 2), 3) at least.","link_id":"t3_tol1","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165333300,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"chime","parent_id":"t1_ctpa5","id":"ctpdh","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807806,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9067-5073c7dc-5c66-481e-83ff-460a3cfb12d4-1566236760"}

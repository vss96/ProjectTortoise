{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; It is not question if it is big deal or not. It is a question of ATTITUDE. Let me write on my house( assume I live alone): No Arabs allowed. Would it be ok? No Blacks? People will be furious about it.\r\n\r\nWho you let into your house is, really, no one else's concern.\r\n\r\n&gt; But if Saudi writes on road - no Jews - it is fine?\r\n\r\nWhy do you single out Jews?  It's simply no non-Muslims.  That's all.  No Jews, no Christians, no Hindus, no Jains, no Buddhists, no animists, no need to list them all, just no one who's not a Muslim.  It's on a road sign so the non-Muslims, who can travel everywhere else in the country, know that they have to take the bypass road.  It's not the same thing as a sign that says \"NO JEWS OR DOGS\" at a public swimming pool.\r\n\r\nAnd, it's not the Saudis.  This restriction has been in place for centuries.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_upl4","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166101914,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"self","id":"curdg","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cur9g","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808517,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27893-c562df56-d2e5-4300-a21a-c5b6aac75cb6-1566236768"}

It supports the claim that there is a non-subjective standard for beauty that comes from either the collective judgment of human beings or intelligent beings in general, but our collective judgment about an object doesn't inhere in the object itself. When you say a property is in the object, then the object has the property independent of any observer. 'A red ball is red, even in a dark room.' However, you're not saying 'the Sistine Chapel is beautiful whether there are any people or not.' You're saying, 'since the abstracted average intelligent being would enjoy the Sistine Chapel, we can consider it beautiful.' â€¦ Which is basically the same claim as Kant made. (Which isn't a bad thing to be!) You just explained in readable prose, which is nice.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ufsk","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808360,"author":"earthboundkid","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuiwu","parent_id":"t1_cuhof","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24022-8673f2aa-8897-460c-91fd-eb722ee35a53-1566236767"}

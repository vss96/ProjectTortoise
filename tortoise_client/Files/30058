You act as if there's some dark cabal of Rubyists issuing edicts to the effect of \"THERE SHALL BE ONE FRAMEWORK AND NO OTHERS BEFORE IT\". There was no group decision made for things to turn out this way; Rails just got really popular in a short span of time.\r\n\r\nI don't know about \"Rubyists\", but I've seen an awful lot of articles which claim that the competition among frameworks somehow hurts Python, and that the community should somehow force a bunch of them to give up, and standardize on one.\r\n\r\nWhich I don't really understand, because frankly the Python community _is_ demonstrably larger than the Ruby community, and has been doing web development for a lot longer (Zope started up in the mid-90's). We've had a lot more opportunity for people to explore and share different ways of tackling the problem, and it's resulted in a lot of fertile development and cross-pollination of ideas. It's a good thing. But judging from what I've read, there are people who think that Guido should just Pronounce one \"official\" Python framework and tell everyone to stop working on the others.\r\n\r\nMakes no sense to me. And I fully expect that within a couple years, Ruby will be in the same spot; Rails will be in the same position Zope has in the Python world, of being \"the original\", but people will have enough experience doing web development in Ruby that viable, mature alternatives will start popping up.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u5es","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808164,"author":"ubernostrum","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cu8iw","parent_id":"t1_cu85q","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18412-6389da43-ff8f-4e41-9d07-2ff9e26e8035-1566236764"}

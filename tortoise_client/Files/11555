He denounced other \"revolutionary\" groups such as The Weathermen (a white leftist terrorist group, many of whose deeds were blamed by Nixon on the BPP). Fred Hampton was murdered in his sleep, by the police. He reached for his gun and it dropped to the floor and went off. The newspapers called it a shootout between police and the Black Panthers.\r\n\r\nThis country has a history of state-sponsored racial violence against black people. Therefore, I do not believe it is fair to put Hampton in the same category as the NRA or others who advocate violence, because historically, the police have protected white people, while in Black communities they have been considerably less effective. The recent shooting of Sean Bell is an example of this. Things were much worse in the 70s, when the real BPP was active.\r\n\r\nWhile I personally do not believe in violence, I admire Fred Hampton for his eloquence, which I aspire to, and what he stood for. You don't see the NRA opening soup kitchens in inner city neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\n\r\ndnA","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167277617,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54291-0a14fe4c-dbe8-48f4-8ce1-498ce02078c2-1566236779"}

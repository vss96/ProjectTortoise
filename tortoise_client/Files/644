Chorus: There is nothing quite as wonderful as money,There is nothing quite as beautiful as cash.Some people say it's folly,But I'd rather have the lolly,With money you can ma-ake a splash. Finale: There is nothing quite wonderful as money, (money,money,money,money)There is nothing like a newly minted pound, (money,money,money,money) All: Everyone must hanker for the butchness of a banker,It's accountancy that makes the world go round. (round,round,round)You can keep your Marxist waysFor it's only just a phase.For it's money money money makes the world go round.

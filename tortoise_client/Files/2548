{"body":"The cream of the crop of the HR's.  Work-a-holics making good money coming out of bad times.  I am a lic. heating contractor grossing $52,000 working for the past 4 1/2 years as a VP for City Service inc. and my wife is a nurse netting $38,000.   We are parents of 3 children with one on the way and active in our comunity.  Oldest son has autism and for years blamed that on our poor choices, but that is not the case we suffered from a poverty mindset.  That is all behind me now.  The only bills that I have monthily are mortage $ 706, Kids tuition $500, Lights, Gas, Cable, car insurance and life insurance.  For an HR I will offer you a high return on your money.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vrl2","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166810494,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"reachthehowards","id":"cvrma","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vrl2","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809209,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45807-262d3851-a6b4-4811-805a-e374aa2ab251-1566236775"}

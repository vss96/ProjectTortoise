I'll try to scratch the surface of your monumental stupidity though:\r\n\r\n1) Going to the moon wasn't pointless, you stupid cunt. If I actually have to explain why space exploration is important for humanity, then you're probably even more of a lost cause than I thought.\r\n\r\n2) You don't know what the Manhattan Project was. Go read a book that isn't titled \"The Fountainhead\" and learn something about what it took to get nuclear fission off the ground. \r\n\r\n3) Kill yourself.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22144-3c2a923d-c081-485f-be9d-198de3be8db9-1566236766"}

You could as easily make a case that communism \"revolves around rights to property\", in that it is predicated upon the notion that proprietary rights are rightfully assigned to the producers/laborers or to the entire community.  You'd be just as wrong as saying that property is the point of capitalism, though.\r\n\r\nThe thing that differentiates capitalism from communism (for instance) is that in capitalism resources (including property) are represented by capital, and in communism resources (including property) are controlled communally.\r\n\r\n&gt; Well, property itself is a \"legal fiction\" too.\r\n\r\nNot so.  Property is an extension of other principles.  If you're a Marxist, it's an extension of the value of labor invested by the laborer.  If you're a nonaggression-principle libertarian, on the other hand, it's an extension of your right to freedom from violence, threat of violence, or fraud, because something you possess cannot be taken from you against your will without employing one of those three tools.  Even in libertarianism and certain variations of objectivism based on self-ownership property is an extension of a principle, in this case the principle of self-ownership: if you own yourself, then it follows that ownership exists for non-self things as well.\r\n\r\nBecause so-called \"intellectual property\" cannot be taken from a person, only duplicated, it does not enjoy the same status as a logically valid extension of principles.\r\n\r\n&gt; Market economies have a hard time with infinitely copyable goods, due to the \"free rider problem.\"\r\n\r\nOpen source software development disproves that idea to some extent, as do the very common and visible cases of the suppression of innovation through intellectual property law (particularly patent law).  The \"free rider problem\" is not actually a problem with ideas, because they are infinitely replicable.  The problem of free riders comes into play with finite resources, and is thus inapplicable to \"intellectual property\".  The claim to the contrary is a specious argument put forth by proponents of strong intellectual property law.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ug5r","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808376,"distinguished":null,"author":"apotheon","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cujrl","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cujq8","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24445-e4d83980-2edd-41c0-a487-8da408819248-1566236767"}

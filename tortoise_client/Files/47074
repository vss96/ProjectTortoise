{"controversiality":0,"body":"Hmmmm...   well, based off of what I have done as a programmer forced to make web pages, including being forced to generate hundreds of web pages based off of data (don't ask), I go with the following :\r\n\r\n(Important) Navigation must be easy and intuitive.  Which means that it typically must be at the top or left side of the page, since that's where most people start looking for things (yes, I realize that is somewhat English/Latin-alphabet centric).\r\n\r\n(Important) Keep your pages consistant.  This means using CSS.  Don't swap colors, backgrounds, fonts, etc., as your users go from page to page.  Ok, you don't have to use CSS, but when you need to change a color or font, it's much easier to change it in one place than hit all of the pages and hope you caught all the changes.\r\n\r\n(Important) White space is important.  If all of your information is clustered together, it makes it hard to read and comprehend.\r\n\r\nDon't deal in absolutes, deal in relatives.  Percentages for widths/heights is best.  As soon as you put best viewed at 1024x768 you are going to get a flood of 800x600 viewers.\r\n\r\n(Important) Know your audience and design according to them.  If your audience is primarily technical, then you can add some bells and whistles to have them do things.  If your audience is severly non-technical, don't make them have to jump through hoops just to get to the content.\r\n\r\nConsistancy.  If an action on one page does one thing, then that action on another page should do the same thing.  Whether it be an 'Add to Cart' button or 'Click for Larger Picture'.\r\n\r\nMake sure whatever you add as far as bells and whistles doesn't break functionality if it doesn't run.  If your viewer has Javascript turned off, then don't make any important functionality require Javascript.","link_id":"t3_u164","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165532407,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"egearman","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu1pv","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u164","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808036,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14803-69a46e7a-0f4f-4142-b18c-7ccac78ab8da-1566236762"}

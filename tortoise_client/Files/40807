A counter example could be the de-secularization of Iraq during Saddam's regime. Religion-influenced civil war  does not really seem all that humble to me. \r\n\r\nIt is also making a forecast, or at least a claim that we are at a world-wide crest with regard to religion. This remains to be seen. \r\n\r\nIt is also possible we were never at some massive point of influence. After all, the religious right did not achieve (m)any of their goals. It could be just a blip, and it is still on a decline when looking a hundred years down the road.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vy8g","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49627-096f0ae4-fd80-40d1-ab2a-ab6ea7588613-1566236777"}

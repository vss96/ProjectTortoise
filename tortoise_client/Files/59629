Anyone who defends The Bell Curve is an anti-scientific quack.\r\n\r\nThe problem with The Bell Curve wasn't inequality, no one cared about that, the problem was its purported EXPLANATION of inequality.\r\n\r\nSimply put, The Bell Curve's authors believed that blacks had lower IQ scores because they were genetically inferior. As opposed to the scientific consensus that they:\r\n\r\n* were poorer\r\n* had lower status\r\n* were oppressed\r\n* had higher rates of crime\r\n* had an anti-achievement culture\r\n\r\nand many other factors. The Bell Curve's authors are scum, pure and simple, and to see them misrepresent their opponents in order to whine and justify themselves is sickening.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4870-99b3e90a-561e-4271-9208-d52c0d56bc96-1566236759"}

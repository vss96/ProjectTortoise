{"body":"Certainly true enough for many, but the people I've known with the most amazing collections have been quite discreet about their things.  The noveau riche feel the need to demonstrate their status and prove themselves, those with a great deal often prefer not to attract attention.  Some very expensive things are rather esoteric so it's fanciful sour grapes to claim the person interested in the item is doing it as a show of status (think of philatelists).  Even when it comes to watches there are those who want a heavy, diamond encrusted Rolex because that makes a bold statement while there are those who prefer a Jaeger-LeCultre that very few people will notice.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vu83","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166932719,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"degustibus","id":"cvw5a","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvw2n","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809294,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48120-45983861-761b-4a20-9e52-57f92f987dd2-1566236777"}

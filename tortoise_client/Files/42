Smalltalk maybe a better language, but say you are tasked with writing a web application to interface with a pre-existing Oracle database.  You don't have a choice for replacing this database.  There is a terabyte of data stored there.  Now, you could go through Oracles' TCP/IP docs or something and hack together a smalltalk database driver and write your application in smalltalk.  Or you could use the existing Oracle JDBC drivers to write you application. \r\n\r\nI think that answers why Java is used.  Can we still ridicule it?  Sure, I guess.  But, is it a sin to program in java?  I dont think so.","link_id":"t3_utqb","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29206-d324b498-d343-4e18-9a26-d4ab1b3c0bbf-1566236769"}

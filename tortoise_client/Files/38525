This was featured at least a year ago on [Hack A Day](http://www.hackaday.com/), and there is a [FAQ page](http://www.gausspistol.com/faq.html) where the danger of such a weapon is explained :  \r\n**Is your Gauss Pistol dangerous?**  \r\nYes, in fact the GP-219 is potentially dangerous in a number of ways:  \r\n* Fully charged, the capacitor terminals have 450V across them.  If you poke your finger around in there you could really get a nasty shock.  \r\n* The pistol weighs almost 3 1/2 lbs, so it would be dangerous if hurled it at someone.  \r\n* The sight is a Class IIIA laser module, which causes retinal damage if stared into for an extended period of time.  \r\n* When disassembled, many of the plastic parts could pose a choking hazard.  \r\n* The kinetic energy of the projectile as it leaves the barrel is a bit more than a CO2 air pistol. Though the energy is similar, the Gauss Pistol projectile weighs around 12.5 times more than a lead pellet and travels about 30% as fast. It would not feel good to be hit at close range, especially in the eye.","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1167057711,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvzf2","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vyrf","author_flair_text":null,"author":"thamer","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809357,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49762-2f3ee888-6585-45ef-af0d-277d421f2a82-1566236777"}

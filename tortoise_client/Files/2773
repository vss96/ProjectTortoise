Suppose that when you use the toilet, you run out of toilet paper every nth time, so P[Running out of TP]=1/n. Then the probability that all of these toilet paper rolls would happen to run out at the same time is 1/n^12. If n=20, say, this is 1/(4.096*10^15).","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24245-b9cbd6f6-fc1d-4bf7-9ffb-e4890c462cf7-1566236767"}

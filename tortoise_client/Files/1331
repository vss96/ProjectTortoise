As far as I know, that's simply not how the world works.\r\n\r\nFor example, how did the protective agencies learn of the plot itself?  Almost certainly not by monitoring the actions of one person acting alone?\r\n\r\nHow do the agencies know the bomb is about to explode, thus providing the justification that torture is required to prevent an *imminent* attack?  If they know that, how come they don't know where the bomb is?\r\n\r\nUltimately, the question is one of oversight.  Who ensures that torture doesn't become capriciously applied by a sadistic person occupying a position of authority?\r\n\r\nThe framers of the United States Constitution recognized that the biggest danger to democracy was the acquisition of unmoderated power.  As far as I can see, those who strive to acquire the power to torture, and use ticking time bomb arguments as a way to acquire that power, are in no way even slightly motivated by a desire to protect American style democracy.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v9pw","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166493502,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":8,"ups":8,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37336-9283e5ec-585b-42fa-a382-8595fc325355-1566236772"}

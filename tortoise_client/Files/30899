There are several academic- and hobbyist-developed relational systems, but they haven't \"caught on,\" largely because they do not use SQL.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement a \"real\" relational database one must eliminate SQL and substitute a different relational data language. But in order to get interest from practitioners, one must support SQL and conventional data access methods, since the practitioners have too much invested in the current SQL systems.\r\n\r\nThe only organizations in a position to effect real change are the big-three database vendors: Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM. And they make too much money off of the status quo to indulge in such risky adventures.\r\n\r\nSince the marketers are in charge at those companies, their database R&amp;D is focused on things like Intellisense and XML support, in order to sell their DB as a package with their developer and middleware tools. It's pathetic.\r\n\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15878-1dd4fd33-3085-47c8-ad0d-4d1e7c7fac90-1566236763"}

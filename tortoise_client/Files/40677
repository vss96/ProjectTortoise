{"body":"Right but why. Was it because of a fundamental change in attitude of the reddit community since the last time? Was the story churned under before people got to see the title? What was the difference? \r\n\r\nBetter search history features would be useful in terms of the story content. Many times we have 3 or 4 posts of essentially the same story from different sites. It would be nice to consolidate all of them into one thread with a time line of submissions and authorship. As the story develops it would be nice to auto-connect to the threads, or have users vote them connected. Why should we keep rediscovering the wheel every time? The group memory should be smarter than any individual. And finally when a long tail event happens like this, where the crowd picks back up something it had previously this should both be apparent in the article/subjects history as well as transparently exposing its causation. These types of issues are crucial to make the web a more useful medium.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vgqk","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166651190,"author":"smacfarl","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cviqf","edited":false,"id":"cvjqh","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809057,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41853-8e8ead22-816b-4843-b1de-5c4577cb6d81-1566236774"}

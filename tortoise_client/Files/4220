Thus freeing up huge numbers of troops to go defend against GE.  \r\n\r\nIf Japan had pinned down USSR in Asia, it probably could not have survived GE onslaught.\r\n\r\nYou should learn more history.\r\n\r\nOut of the 4 main allies US/Commonwealth/USSR/China exactly 1 was invaded by Germany. Exactly one defeated that invasion and couterattacked to to take 1/2 of Germany.  If US was invaded by Japan you think we'd be off helping UK?   \r\n\r\nMy point is USSR had alot on its plate and to fault it for not going off and opening a 2nd front for itself is ridiculos.  Remember US went with the Europe First strategy and \"abandoned\" PT, phillipines anyone.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165633015,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cu762","parent_id":"t1_cu6eo","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"njharman","retrieved_on":1473808139,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17724-1d55edfd-b750-4b0e-84df-c7f9b57c976b-1566236763"}

They even made a movie about it, google \"Road to Guantanamo\".  I saw it, and I have to say in all honesty that I was tortured similarly in my fraternity hazing rituals and everyone endures MUCH WORSE treatment as a basic trainee infantryman at Ft. Benning, Georgia - to say nothing of the RIP program.  I also hear that SEAL indoctrination and SERE school are much rougher.\r\n\r\nSome people who dislike the US (for whatever reason) will grasp at any straws and make all kinds of overblown statement (eg. the title of the article under discussion) to express their unhappiness.  Just like an ugly girl at a party bitching about how the drinks are weak.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vcii","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808940,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvdrd","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvczv","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38773-3bf39d48-f373-4755-8542-c88c0dc9c7fc-1566236773"}

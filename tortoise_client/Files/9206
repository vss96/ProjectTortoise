I'm just trying to poke a whole in this guy's steel exterior and mention that he's actually human...\r\n\r\nBy the way I'm being downvoted, you'd think I'd be in bed with the creationists or something, where anyone who says a blanket statement about religious people gets points. This is the problem with \"the wisdom of crowds\". I provide lots of detailed evidence why this story is bullshit, and it's modded down. I guess people believe what they want to believe. Please, if people would stop lazily downvoting me and actually checking their own preconceived notions, or possibly even provide corroborating evidence for this article in the face of all of the contrary evidence i've provided, please do so. or feel free to continue to mod me down.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_whql","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809764,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"carpeliam","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwk9c","id":"cwl2v","timestamp_epoch":1566236781,"message_id":"61007-a788a365-f5e5-4422-9ffa-cbc8f99144a6-1566236781"}

The cops are in dangerous situations, and must control those situations.  No excessive force was demostrated in the photo, and it seems to have been chosen merely for the emotional impact of a man in armor juxtaposed with a child in a vulnerable position.\r\n\r\nWould this have been considered akin to Nazi tactics if the police call was for child abuse, or suspected murder?\r\n\r\nBecause drugs are illegal, drugs are associated with violence, and cops must take proper precautions to protect not only themselves, but bystanders.\r\n\r\nIt's the laws against personal use of /anything/ that are wrong.  Nothing in the photograph is objectionable, beyond wild speculation from fearmongers.  For that matter, I could posit that the man had just anally raped the child and was forcing him to wank himself back to a boner to reciprocate.\r\n\r\nHe's standing there while the kid takes a piss, and that's standard procedure.  How would you rather any law enforcement officer handle this?\r\n","controversiality":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165862767,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cugsf","parent_id":"t1_cugqs","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"QuinnFazigu","retrieved_on":1473808319,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22844-ccfea4d3-7074-46d1-be68-abda259993d6-1566236766"}

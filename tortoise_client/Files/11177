You're essentially defending a dumb example by trying to redefine reality out of existence. The fact that you declare age of reproduction to be unresponsive to heredity doesn't make it true.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, your repeating something doesn't make it more convincing. And when someone points out things you've overlooked, it's really stupid of you to talk to them as if they \"misunderstand\" what you're saying. It's condescending and arrogant, and only serves to make you look like an idiot.\r\n\r\nFinally, nothing contributes more to differential rates of genetic propagation than contraceptives. You heard right. Even survival rates in the most primitive societies have less of an effect on the spread of your genes than the pill.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808286,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuex6","id":"cuf2j","edited":false,"author":"richardkulisz","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21999-ede9e314-7ee0-45b3-bcf8-57859a801cf7-1566236766"}

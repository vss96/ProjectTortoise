It's also not at all useful, neither for computer science nor mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe IEEE standard on floating point numbers can handle Inf and -Inf and NaN. A good programmer will know how to use these correctly, and moreover, one would probably never let a program get that far. It could throw an exception or otherwise handle this error condition gracefully.\r\n\r\nThis isn't useful for mathematics either, because a set of R union {nullity} is no longer a field. Hell, it's not even a group, since \"nullity\" has no inverse under either addition or multiplication. For non-mathematicians, this means that this new set does not have a decent mathematical structure.\r\n\r\nWhat really raises my ire is how carelessly this guy works with infinity. For real numbers, it is a well designed concept when you talk about limits, e.g. 1/x^2-&gt;infinity as x-&gt;0, but when he treats it as just another number, he's talking nonsense, so it's no wonder he's reached such spurious conclusions.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ty8s","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808000,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"joshdick","id":"ctzrj","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctzog","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13962-685db9d5-b4cd-4805-ab6b-5e47b3fe2766-1566236762"}

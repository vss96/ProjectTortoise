As this caffeine withdrawal pain eventually went away altogether I do believe it was all addiction related.  And while I can't yet prove it, I do believe there is a direct relationship between the pain on exiting an addiction and the damage it does to you while you are addicted.  Under that view, caffeine is one of the most evil substances I have encountered!  \r\n\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w5fg","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809538,"distinguished":null,"author":"cyruspp","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw89r","id":"cw90c","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54860-d62c691b-9b20-4ced-8d16-eb8760abc7d3-1566236779"}

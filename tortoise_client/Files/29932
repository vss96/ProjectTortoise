If so then free will most certainly does not exist. Everything has cause. As we learn more about the brain we are beginning to understand some of the causes.\r\n\r\nHowever, if free will is the ability to do as one desires then everyone has some degree of free will. We all make decisions about what we do. We make choices. We choose between alternatives based on our emotions, reason, circumstances etc.\r\n\r\nI think the confusion is in how the two definitions relate. We have freedom to make choices and subordinate certain desires to others, but we do not have the freedom to arbitrarily choose our desires.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vf8l","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808986,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"djwhitt","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vf8l","id":"cvg5f","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40105-bddf5445-9835-4633-a45e-26a31f4fb8c7-1566236773"}

The largest invasion in history (4 million men) is still the 22 June 1941 Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union and after that it was pretty much win or perish for Stalin &amp; co.\r\n\r\nAs for Russia still being \"in shit\", Germany and Japan were both much more highly developed than Russia in 1939. It's not terribly surprising that the relationship remained much the same after 1945.

{"body":"The more I read their opinions on things, the more I agree with them.\r\n\r\n&gt; Q: I don't know if you've heard about this, but there have been essays written about the concept of the \"South Park Republican.\"\r\n\r\n&gt; TREY: Yeah, we have seen that. What we're sick of—and it's getting even worse—is: you either like Michael Moore or you wanna fuckin' go overseas and shoot Iraqis. There can't be a middle ground. Basically, if you think Michael Moore's full of shit, then you are a super-Christian right-wing whatever. And we're both just pretty middle-ground guys. We find just as many things to rip on on the left as we do on the right. People on the far left and the far right are the same exact person to us.\r\n\r\n&gt; Q: You seem to feel free to roast everybody equally.\r\n\r\n&gt; TREY: And it comes from an honest belief we have, which is... George Bush doesn't know what's going on. Michael Moore does not know what's going on. And Alec Baldwin definitely does not know what's going on. Basically, this shit is gigantically complicated.\r\n\r\nSo true! I've never understood people's tendencies to proudly say \"I'm a conservative!\" or \"I'm a liberal!\". Both are extremes that nobody in this real world lives within.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tpok","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-3,"ups":-3,"created_utc":1165377030,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"ctsf0","parent_id":"t1_ctr6r","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807864,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10658-532effd9-1ab1-4e7c-ab0b-7c441079c5c7-1566236761"}

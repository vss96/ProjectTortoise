The guy who ran the cult that gassed the subways in Japan is on death row now, I believe.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:  You sit on death row for an undetermined amount of time.  Then, at random, you're taken out of your cell one day, a bag put over your head, and killed.  You family is then notified after the fact.  So, you end up spending anything from days to years, just waiting for this random event where you die.  Fucked up, no?  \r\n\r\nI'd have to look it up, but I think it really is waiting.  Not waiting for an appeals process or red tape, it's just there to fuck with you.","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60334-a1eaaf30-51ce-47a3-bbca-0eefa3f7d092-1566236780"}

He had been harassing me for several weeks by stopping me to \"run the numbers\" on my bike to \"make sure it isn't stolen\".  Sometimes he would stop me a couple of times a day.  This was a serious harassment as I was a freshman college student at the time and he repeatedly made me miss class.\r\n\r\nThe night he made his threat he pulled me over while I was riding with friends.  It was in front of them that he made the threat.\r\n\r\nAfter the threat I made extra careful to avoid him by staying off the streets I knew he patrolled.  After a few more months he seemed to lose interest in harassing me and that was the end of it.\r\n\r\nThe way I found out about what was going on in his head was that years later a friend of mine found herself working in the same place as the girl who had been his fianc√©e and who then became his wife.\r\n\r\nSince my friend recognized the married name they talked about what had happened, compared notes, and figured out what had been going on.\r\n\r\nThe sad thing is that he caused me to flunk out of my first semester at college with too many absences.  As a result, my girlfriend left me which I didn't take well and it took several years for me to get myself back on track.  My life today would be completely different if not for his actions.\r\n\r\nI guess maybe there were some more details to the story after all.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v4jc","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35122-3e901caa-9b84-4e1a-963e-085cdef5d818-1566236771"}

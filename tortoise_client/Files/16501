Reading the news doesn't make you smart; I'd argue that with today's \"soundbite culture\", it actually makes you stupid.  Reading *books*, working on *problems*, and talking to *people* makes you smart.  I generally see women doing those a lot more than men (who waste their time on silly things like Reddit), so IQ or not, I tend to think women are smarter.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807462,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ct5r8","id":"ct70j","edited":false,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"647-a9322747-48ef-4ec9-a5ca-cbce0ac8e489-1566236758"}

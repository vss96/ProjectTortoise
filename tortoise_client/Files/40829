But are you somehow ignoring that the Danes broke their own rules to extradite that guy?\r\n\r\nBreaking our extradition policy was a bad move, and most Danes seem to agree. It's been upheld in the past in the face of strong political pressure, so it's shameful that the government and courts have not always been 100% consistent on this matter.\r\n\r\n&gt; That case tells you that if you break Germany's restrictive laws on speech, you better stay out of Denmark, and any other country that might cave.\r\n\r\nThat's not what I take away from it. My take-away is that if you go to a country, you should be prepared to follow their laws or face the consequences. No-one forced that guy to go to Germany and distribute material that he surely knew was illegal. Don't victimize people like this.","retrieved_on":1473809234,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvsw9","id":"cvsyn","author_flair_text":null,"author":"psykotic","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46578-910aff27-2311-4d01-b112-a99b976f5f3d-1566236775"}

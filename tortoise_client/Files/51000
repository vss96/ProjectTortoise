For example - if I have two wives and I become incapacitated, which one gets to make medical decisions on my behalf (especially if the two disagree)? How do inheritance rights work in such a situation? Should employers be obligated to extend health coverage to multiple spouses? Polygamy also raises the thorny issue of huge families - a man with three wives is capable of producing dozens of kids which none but the very richest could hope to afford, which means much of the support would fall to the state.\r\n\r\nNone of that is an argument for why polygamy should be illegal, but the point is that \"legalizing polygamy\" requires a huge re-write of the laws to account for questions like that. Legalizing gay marriage simply requires making existing laws gender neutral (which they should be anyway). It's not quite an apples to apples comparison.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v4ak","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34737-831f92d1-2f45-4ddc-ac09-328e119ba3b6-1566236771"}

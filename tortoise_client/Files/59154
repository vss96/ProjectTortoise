It's all the same money.\r\n\r\nGiven that Republicans have been running the tax system and the spending system for the past few years, and it was in surplus during the Clinton years, I'd say it was a Republican problem. The Republican party has become the party that refuses to do the simple math: cut taxes, increase spending, deficits will go up. \r\n\r\nThis is basically unrelated to the long-term health of the Social Security program, *considered alone.*  Discretionary government spending and income tax rates, etc., can be adjusted quite quickly. Don't want to build a bridge? Cut it. Can't afford a war in Iraq? Don't start it.\r\n\r\nSocial security spending for retirees can't be adjusted easily without breaking implicit promises to every 67-year old who is planning to live to 80+ and retired this year with Social Security in mind.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v8uv","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808943,"author":"sickofthisshit","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvdvu","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvajl","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38842-505752b8-9adc-40bb-9acf-fa5eff6f386b-1566236773"}

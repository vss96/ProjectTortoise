Are you saying PG is a somewhat delusional millionaire living in a bubble who doesn't understand much outside of a narrow band of existence (young men, money, dinner parties, web 2.0)?\r\n\r\n&gt; I do believe that Ballmer has way more than Alan Kay.\r\n\r\nLegend has it that Steve-O is a formidable VB programmer.  Doesn't that make you just want to say, \"yes, LEAD ME\"?  It's almost a religious experience!  And he loves developers so, so much.\r\n\r\n&gt; You can't measure if someone is a genius by looking at their wallet.\r\n\r\nEveryone wants to make money, yes?  So if everyone is trying, it stands to reason that those with more have a more intelligent approach, and the richest people are the ones with the best ideas.  If someone else is so smart, why don't they make a billion dollars doing what other people want?

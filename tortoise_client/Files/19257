I swear half the time I try to copy a dev project onto a portable drive I forget to close Visual Studio, only to get an error message (but not until it's already copied about 100 MB of data) that &lt;random project file no human ever looks at&gt; is open and the copy operation cannot continue.\r\n\r\nWTF? Why make open files that can't be copied? I can sorta understand the rationale for not wanting to copy files that may be in some inconsistent state, but either give me a choice or let the rest of the files copy regardless. Don't make me close my project just so the copy operation runs.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t2dc","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"483-8f2fa6d3-4f86-460e-bc95-85947d35f326-1566236758"}

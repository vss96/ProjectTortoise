In spontaneous symmetry breaking, you get massless scalar (spinless) particles - Goldstone bosons. [In electroweak theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson#Theoretical_details), there are 4 such fields, 3 are taken up by massless gauge bosons to become the massive vector bosons W+ W- and Z and you're left with a massive physical Higgs boson.\r\n\r\nThe axion is a (pseudo-)Goldstone boson. It provides [a way round the strong CP problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peccei-Quinn_theory) and arises if you regard the troublesome CP-violating theta term (see earlier wiki link) as a dynamic field. There are various possible mechanisms, some involving additional scalar (Higgs-like) fields others with heavy quarks, but in essence you use the scalar theta field to modify the Higgs mechanism to ensure CP in QCD then, as well as the Higgs, you get this physical particle - the axion. \r\n\r\nLike the Higgs, the axion is colourless (only quarks have colour) and it interacts with via electroweak and QCD - [the QCD Lagrangian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong-CP_problem#Strong_CP_problem) shows the theta term coupled to the gluon term Fuv via the strong coupling constant g.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_tvrc","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807981,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"gIowingsheep","id":"ctyr6","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctwos","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13559-c29b0031-4226-4d9e-bd03-c2c7018a6cf6-1566236762"}

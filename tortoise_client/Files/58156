(Although  most took to heart the lesson learned in the Revolution that the militia cannot be the only weapon in the arsenal; i.e., there is a strong need for a standing army in war time.)  Given the advances in technology, and the changes in society, I don't think that we could place a lot of competence in a militia to defend our liberties if we were threatened -- that is, in the days of the Founding Fathers, there were many people who were quite proficient with muskets; today most people would need significant training to fire guns accurately, not to mention to man tanks or helicopters or other aircraft.  The point being, the way that wars are fought has changed significantly to mandate the neccisity of a trained, efficient force on hand; see, e.g., WWII.  That of course given the assumption that a defense against such things is needed; I won't get into that, I just wanted to point out that a militia composed of farmers isn't as effective as it once was.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165354453,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":3,"score":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9940-41721468-5fcf-4089-a8ab-7ece39f84b01-1566236761"}

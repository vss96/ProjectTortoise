I am an America First isolationist.  I believe that the United States should at the very least have no foreign policy at all, and should probably be dissolved entirely.  It is truly amazing that you can't grasp the difference between these polar opposites.\r\n\r\nThe fact that you don't believe an attack on a US military barracks - Khobar Towers - is an attack on \"us\" demonstrates that your allegiance to the Empire is no greater than mine.  So why do we disagree?\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve \"international Justice,\" you need a great deal more than \"soft power.\"  You need exactly what you purport to detest - a worldwide empire.  It is very similar to the views of Marx and Chomsky, who profess to be anarchists - but first, of course, they have to take over the State.  Ha.\r\n\r\nAs for \"soft power,\" there is no factual way to determine whether this entity exists.  Perhaps, as you say, we are simply refusing to use it.  Perhaps the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists, too.  What are the great historical examples of \"soft power\"?  For example, what did it do for the Carter Administration?\r\n\r\nDo you want a list of agreements with the US that foreign dictatorships have failed to live up to over the last 50 years?  It is even longer, believe me, than the list of agreements the US itself has failed to live up to.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, if we had lived up to all of ours, they would have lived up to all of theirs.  If our hearts can only be made pure, the reign of love will break out all over.\r\n\r\nDon't you see how much your thinking owes to Christian doctrine?  You may not believe in God - you probably don't (I sure don't), but the philosophy you espouse has a history.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a Christian philosophy.  It's not just that the Gospels are full of it.  It is also the Calvinist/Puritan philosophy of New England - of Cotton Mather, Jonathan Edwards, William Ellery Channing, Henry David Thoreau, Edward and Francis Bellamy, John Dewey, and so on.  I think you would find it very edifying to trace this history.  (Or just google \"city on a hill.\"  Or \"Unitarian.\")\r\n\r\nFrankly, here is my opinion: Christianity is nonsense.  People do not turn the other cheek.  They take advantage of you.  They will fuck you over any chance they get.  Becoming a better and more decent person does not make other people more nice to you.  It is great, but it doesn't mean you don't need to look out for your own interests.  Giving your lunch money to underprivileged youths, and going hungry instead, may feel really good in your heart.  But tomorrow, those youths are going to know who to talk to again.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for governments.  I have no real love for the US government, but I do live here, and when it gets jacked, I get jacked along with it.  And I hate to see us get jacked because so many of its voters are, like you, high on Jesus.  (Especially when they don't even know it.)","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vq1i","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167284963,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":0,"score":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54438-50666ec9-e6e6-4f1b-b4f0-2bd4b5577de6-1566236779"}

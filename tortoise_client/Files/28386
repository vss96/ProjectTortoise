Couldn't be happier.  The car is comfortable, quiet, speedy, and gets more than 40mpg avg per tank.  AND it has a lot of legroom in the backseat and a hatch for cargo.  Handles well too.  We also have a 1991 Toyota Corolla LE which is super and will keep it another 10 years as it will certainly last it's built so well.","retrieved_on":1473809722,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wi17","id":"cwiur","author_flair_text":null,"author":"weegee","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59776-2b454785-908b-4e71-b77a-8fe0b03598f9-1566236780"}

This vehicle somehow possesses vastly less interior room than one would expect from its exterior dimensions, like a reverse TARDIS, and feels downright claustrophobic. Daimler Chrysler's engineers accomplished this feat by skillfully combining a low roofline, high beltline, tiny windows, and placing the doorframe about an inch from your head. This results in a pleasant combination of poor visibility and constantly feeling your head brush up against the doorframe and visor (I'm 5'8\"). I swear that I almost got into three accidents driving the Stratus ten miles because I didn't see the other car until almost too late.\r\n\r\nI stopped at rental car place the next morning and told the fellow behind the counter that I needed a different car.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of car did they give you?\"\r\n\"A Dodge Stratus.\"\r\n\"Isn't it annoying how your head is constantly bumping up against stuff?\"\r\n\r\nTo quote Paul Graham: \"There's no way around it: you can't manage a process intended to produce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is. American cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with bad taste.\"\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ualz","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20113-bfc2c39f-8f53-4783-86cb-cfd26cea8c36-1566236765"}

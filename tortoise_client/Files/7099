{"controversiality":1,"body":"\"James Kim did nothing wrong,\"\r\n\r\nI think this is kind BS for benifit of the family.  Most everything I've ever learned about survival is stay put and not go off wandering.\r\n\r\nAnd obviously he made a bad choice cause if he stayed with his family he would have been saved along with them.\r\n\r\nFinaly \"Your dad is a hero\".  Sorry heros don't die pointless uncessary deaths.  Might be nice thing to say to grieving family but it's just not true.\r\n\r\nIt's bad and morally wrong to be encouraging future people stuck in survival situations to go out and be \"heros\" killing themselves needlessly.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u6ke","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165635577,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"njharman","parent_id":"t3_u6ke","edited":false,"id":"cu7a2","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808142,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17799-a06300dc-a74b-4fee-bc2b-668a2490a4f0-1566236763"}

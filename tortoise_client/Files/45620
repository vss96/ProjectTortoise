The State has long put into practice the simple \"We'll harrass your ass to death, even though we don't have a case\" practice, trying to bankrupt and hassle those that it considers a problem.  This is why they do many of the things they do, even though they know they don't have a case.\r\n\r\nBut regarding the journey to even get before a jury: Consider the humility, stress and the financial cost of having to defend yourself agains the thuggish State, just so you can go to trial and hopefully get a fair hearing where the jury itself hasn't been brainwashed into believing that their duty is to convict you. Many juries are **instructed** by the judge to come back with a guilty verdict. \r\n\r\nThen there's job loss, ostracizing and rumor mongering among all those that still adhere to the State mandate that the State is always right.\r\n\r\nJust getting on a jury is hard enough, especially if you understand jury nullification.  This will disqualify you before many judges and prosecuting lawyers.\r\n\r\nI'm **all for it**, but we've long since passed the point of jury nullification working sufficiently well enough to change the attitude held by the State that it can mandate every sort of behavior on the planet.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808313,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cughf","parent_id":"t1_cufzu","author_flair_text":null,"author":"lifeofliberty","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22669-608d6d3e-da5b-4e78-a4b8-85d079c21709-1566236766"}

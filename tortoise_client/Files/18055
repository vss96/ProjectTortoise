I mean, the alternative for them wouldn't be to be raised lovingly by their farmer, it would be to never be born in the first place.\r\n\r\nDon't forget the meat farming, and particularly the agricultural base that supports it, has displaced most of the world's plant and animal species from their native habitats--there are currently billions of critters that are never born,  due to cattle farming.  It's perhaps accurate to say our choice to institutionalize and kill billions of animals each year is a choice between doing what's tasty, and doing what's right.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, I liked your line of thought--very productive.   \r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vqyl","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809225,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"tuber","edited":false,"id":"cvsgq","parent_id":"t1_cvs6l","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46278-c0360ac3-15de-4c56-b30a-5f141a7bd585-1566236775"}

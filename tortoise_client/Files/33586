Make a nice web framework.  Your language may have one already.\r\n\r\n2.  Create a fifteen minute video about \"Making a shopping cart with X\".  Make sure you throw in some AJAX.  During video, ensure you mention \"Web 2.0\" and \"AJAX\" several times over.\r\n\r\n3.  Put together a website for Framework X.  Use only a few colors and round edges (no squares!).  In otherwords make it bubbly.  Make sure the main page has a couple colored circles saying \"AJAX\" and \"Web 2.0\".  The word \"Mashup\" and \"Enterprise\" work good too.\r\n\r\n4.  Write a book or have someone write one for you.  It doesn't have to be great, just ensure O'Reilly publishes it.\r\n\r\n5.  Find a few \"gurus\" to go on a conference circuit and demo the framework.\r\n\r\n6.  Start a grass root effort and claim that your framework is superior to Rails, .NET, and Java.\r\n\r\n7. Profit  :)\r\n\r\nI wrote this with a bit of humor but I can almost guarantee you it will work.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w7e7","subreddit":"programming","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1167270540,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54128-e635d2b5-8351-4f8b-ae4b-0639dea35b64-1566236779"}

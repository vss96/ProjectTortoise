{"body":"I just want to say that as a reform jew I strongly disagree with your comment that one should not take a group of people seriously simply because they do not act \"consistently with what they call their holy books.\"  In fact I find your comment quite bigoted.  In virtually every religion people vary in what degree they believe their beliefs and behaviors should adapt with society; and I would argue that with in every group of such people you can find at least one representative who has cogent supporting arguments.\r\n\r\nThe reality is that religion is not simply a matter of following an instruction manual.  In fact, much more of religion is about inherited tradition and spoken history.  Writings are frozen in time; religions and cultures are not.\r\n\r\nHow is your comment that much different than fundamentalist christian saying that he could at least take muslims seriously if they accepted christ as their savior?","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vat3","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166514039,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"snoble","edited":false,"id":"cvbov","parent_id":"t1_cvblb","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808901,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37774-9c2664e8-5fdd-40a8-afc9-59d1f702bbfd-1566236772"}

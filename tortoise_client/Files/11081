{"body":"Boy, you know, I'm normally the wacky liberal amongst my peers, the person who wants shorter sentences for most things, rehabilitation and the like.  Especially for kids.  But if the quotes in this article are even halfway true, it's chilling.  This kid killed a man in cold blood, for no reason, and then showed no remorse.  And now is trying to get out of it.  If there's any better reason to keep someone locked up, I don't know what else.  Maybe 22 years w/o the possiblity of parole is too hard, but only because there's a small, small chance that this kid could grow into something different- so give him 22 years but with a chance to get out earlier if he does change, however unlike.  But still, scary stuff.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_trhc","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":16,"ups":16,"created_utc":1165374719,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"foxyvixen","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctsac","parent_id":"t3_trhc","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807861,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10603-96bb89ff-90b8-4d14-8b88-667a241b3a4e-1566236761"}

You think the law should be against endangering people irresponsibly, that would cover a whole host of things, such as libel, slander, yelling fire in crowded places, or denying the holocaust.  Because each of these things can be argued to place people in danger.  In the case of libel or slander, you are putting their reputation, character and livelyhood in danger, in the case of yelling fire, you're putting their physical person in danger, and in the case of denying the holocaust you are creating a situation where such prejudice could rise to destructive heights again.\r\n\r\nWhat I was saying is that you have to propose some other law or wording whether it's \"speech should not put others in danger\", or whatever floats your boat, but you cannot just say that there should be \"NO\" restrictions on a persons right to free speech.  I think that statement is unrealistic and irresponsible.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v1y6","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37237-f4797952-8253-4455-898f-67c2d95552d6-1566236772"}

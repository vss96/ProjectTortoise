Many economists work at universities and for the government, both organizations that largely support state intervention in the economy.  They are pro-free-market compared to their non-economist peers, but probably much less than they'd be if their salaries didn't depend on keeping pro-state people happy.\r\n\r\nThe [Ludwig Von Mises](http://mises.org) institute doesn't accept any government money for just this reason.  Also, it would obviously compromise their anarcho-capitalist principles :)\r\n\r\nAlso, an interesting side note is that while the late Milton Friedman was far more pro-market than most, he didn't quite advocate anarcho-capitalism like his son, [David D.

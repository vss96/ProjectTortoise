Here we go... \r\n\r\n&gt;By now I hope that most of you have atleast tried Vista. If not, join the bandwagon . INSTALL VISTA!!! :)\r\n\r\n&gt;1&gt; Launch group favorites in IE: This feature is really nice. You can open all items in your Favorites group by clicking on the arrow\r\n\r\nOpen in tabs?\r\n\r\n&gt;2&gt; Shortcuts to quick launch items: We can use Windows key and number keys to launch the quick launch items. So win+1 would result in minimizing all apps\r\n\r\nShortcut keys????!?!? surely these have been in use since the 80's...\r\n\r\n&gt;3&gt; Snipping tool: This is a nice tool to get an image clip and to edit it.\r\n\r\nHmmm... freeware apps since win9X?\r\n\r\n&gt;4&gt; Windows movie maker: I use this a lot to make movies of photos. You can add your own transitions and audio effects. This makes for some greate video albums to share with your family/community.\r\n\r\nCheck out one of my videos :)\r\n\r\nNice - the link don't work bud... perhaps its IE7 only ;-)\r\n\r\n&gt;5&gt; Open app with administrator privileges\r\n\r\nThats a new one.\r\n\r\n&gt;8&gt; Ctrl + Mousewheel to increase/decrease IE fontsize:\r\n\r\nHmmm, thats been around since the year dot too.\r\n\r\n&gt;9&gt; Bcdedit tool: If you have a dual OS on your system you might be familiar with the boot.ini file in XP. However, in Vista we do not have such a file. We use bcdedit to edit the boot configurations. I like the command bcdedit /set {current} description “your menu description“ to customize the options displayed when booting up. Also another option that I use is the delaytime which I reduce from 20 secs to around 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nSo this will allow me to boot Ubuntu or maybe OSX? \r\n\r\n&gt;10&gt; Deleting folders with no access: Sometimes you cannot delete a folder even though you are the administrator. Tim Sneath posted a gem on this. The solution is simple. Create a batch command file (*****.cmd) as follows:\r\n                takeown /f %1 /r /d y\r\n                icacls %1 /grant administrators:F /t\r\nNoe all you need to do is specify the folder as the argument (*****.cmd folderName) and then delete. Chaching... :)\r\n\r\nNow that sounds like a linux fix! Command Line????\r\n\r\n&gt;11&gt; Audio Control: Click on the audio icon in the tray and open the mixer. You will see sound adjustments for several devices\r\n\r\nPlease, someone switching is NOT GOING TO NEED THIS TIP - ITS THE SAME AS XP.\r\n\r\n&gt;12&gt; Performance tools: Vista provides a set of tools which are intuitive and easy to use. Control Panel\\System and Maintenance\\Performance Information and Tools\\Advanced tools - thats the  location you get these tools. Click on the 'Generate a health report' - this analyzes your system and provides suggestions for maximizing performance. This is just one of several helpful tools.\r\n\r\nLOL - Generate Health report - \"It's now time to reinstall the operating system... you've been looking at too much porn and its too buggered with spyware...\"\r\n\r\nTrolling, I know...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v86o","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166460935,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36113-2522341b-0564-4df0-86fd-6f75873aafcf-1566236772"}

State and national lotteries feed on mathematical innumeracy: people can't calculate the average expected payoffs and so don't realize that they're negative.  They just see \"$50 million jackpot!\" and think \"Wouldn't that be nice?\", not realizing that the odds of success are about 1 in 100 million.  Startups generally have a *positive* average expected payoff: you get a $50 million payoff (well, more like $5M or $10M after splitting with other investors), with about an [18% chance](http://onstartups.com/Home/tabid/3339/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1088/SixInterestingStatsAboutStartupSuccess.aspx) of success.  \r\n\r\nIf you play the lottery every day for the rest of your life, chances are you'll go broke.  If you start a company every year for the rest of your life, chances are you'll get rich.

Their primary concern is with appearances.  In this case they wanted to appear tough on sex offenders so they drafted a law that seemed pretty straight forward.\r\n\r\nThe end result is a system where in the eyes of the law a person magically transforms into an adult the day of their birthday (16th, 17th, or 18th depending on where you live). Had they engaged in consensual sex the day before things would have been fine whereas now one or both of them are going to face prison/sex offender status for life.\r\n\r\nRemoving \"Romeo\" protection statutes for people under 14 just adds another \"magic birthday\" for parents to worry about.  The system is broken.","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14184-c7da0af7-a351-4f52-8cb2-db45e5f36692-1566236762"}

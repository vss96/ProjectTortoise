{"body":"Environment is a serious problem - and it is related, if you think about it. Crtical thinkers would be aware of it and would do something about it. People who don't *think* are the cause of the problem. I can bet you there is a huge overlap between those and the religious idiots.\r\n\r\nAll the points you sited about the conquistadors or the \r\nSalem Witch Hunt are valid. However the *excuse* for the killings was religion. It was a moral justification for nothing less than thievery or political gain. Politicians exploit religion for their ends and have done so for ever: Even the present Islamic Fundamentalists are politicians using Islam for their ends. Take religion away from them and they are that much weaker. They will lose their excuse. That is the point. \r\n\r\nIt is not going to be easy. It's only been a hundred years since Darwin - But this is a start in the right direction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx8t","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166994830,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Raoulmeister","edited":false,"id":"cvxw4","parent_id":"t1_cvxv5","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809327,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48995-f331fa53-59df-4f52-b207-846af53cb299-1566236777"}

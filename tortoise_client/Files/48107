This is a very important metric for systems where the updates are the crictical parts, such as banks, and large businesses.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, most of the benchmarks I've seen are _requests_ based, which makes me think queries.  This is more important if the data is slowly changing (a nebulous concept at best), or if it's not handled transactionally.  MySQL is traditionally seen to excel this domain, which happens to correspond well to many web applications.\r\n\r\nThus, whilst TPC is useful, it's prehaps not the ideal metric for certain catagories of use.

{"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_u719","stickied":false,"body":"The example was meant to illustrate the definition; it's a mathematical fact.\r\n\r\nHere's another illustration which I hope is closer to what you consider 'real world' concepts: the fundamental theorem of structured programming, which was proved way back in the 60's, showed that programs written in a programming language whose sole control operator is conditional 'goto' can be faithfully translated into a structured programing language that has only 'if' and 'while' control-flow operators; note the absense of 'break' or 'continue'. However, the goto-based language is more expressible, in the sense of Felleisen, than the structured programming language.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, the translation from structured programming language to goto-based language is local and structurally inductive:\r\n\r\n    if e then s1 else s2;\r\n\r\ntranslates to\r\n\r\n    goto L1 if e;\r\n    [s2];\r\n    goto L2;\r\n    L1:\r\n    [s1];\r\n    L2:\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    while e do s;\r\n\r\ntranslates to\r\n\r\n    L1:\r\n    goto L2 if !e;\r\n    [s];\r\n    goto L1;\r\n    L2:\r\n\r\nConversely, the translation in the other direction, from goto-based to structured language, is context sensitive in an arbitrarily non-local way. (It's easy to get a feel for the impossibility of a nice translation in this converse direction, but it's hard to prove rigorously.)\r\n\r\nThis example shows that 'more expressive' is not some dishonest academic way of saying 'better', I hope.\r\n\r\nNow, rather than being spoon-fed everything, perhaps you can try being a bit imaginative for a change: please give some examples of how this can tie into mundane Java or C programming. Hint: consider the contortions that people sometimes engage in with nested loops to get the effect of a goto to an outer label, i.e. a 'deep break'.","controversiality":0,"ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165838588,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuf4s","id":"cuf8m","author":"psykotic","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808291,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22078-63415496-a99c-4d84-b6c5-30f7d409bbb6-1566236766"}

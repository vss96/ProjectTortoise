If it were really profitable to go to the moon, then business would be doing so.  Look at Virgin Galactic, they saw that it would be profitable to go into orbit, so they're doing it.  It's one thing for the government to build infrastructure that serves businesses, like paving roads, but it's another thing altogether to try and build whole new types of businesses.  If there's a new type of business that could be profitable, then a private entity would already be trying to do it.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23407-50f2dbf5-e4a2-44c5-88ec-de9b0f11e288-1566236766"}

{"body":"This phenomenon of \"unpolitical government\" is so fascinating.\r\n\r\nIn the US, just about every researcher is in practice a government employee.  In many fields it is the general custom for professors to pay their own salary out of their grants.  In this system, even supposedly \"private\" universities, which spent the last jillion years guarding their intellectual independence, are no more than providers of expensive office space.\r\n\r\nAnd how can you have government without politics?  In a democracy, no less?  Inquiring minds would sure like to know. \r\n\r\nIn actual reality, not the simulacrum thereof which this strange system appears to inhabit, all successful scientists today are to some extent politicians.  Political skill is at least as important as scientific creativity for success in the contemporary research environment.  I mean, witness this petition!  It's apolitical politics at its finest.\r\n\r\nA good book about the way science actually works in Washington today is [The Politics of Pure Science](http://www.amazon.com/Politics-Pure-Science-Daniel-Greenberg/dp/0226306321) by Daniel Greenberg (who is not, I hasten to assure you, a Republican).","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uqft","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166118537,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cusdi","parent_id":"t3_uqft","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808535,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28350-61bce931-6739-45b4-8e57-1fc6e5917051-1566236768"}

I know video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii and PS3 have an EXTREMELY low markup, something to the tune of $3-5 for a $249 system, so retailers have no choice but to price it at retail price or face losses.\r\n\r\nMy company also has a MAP policy (of 20% off), which most retailers promptly discount to that price, so in other words it's just a street price. Some retailers put up a \"call for price\" quote, in which they reply with discounts of up to 40% off, and which we don't do anything about. \r\n\r\nI've yet to see an iPod discounted anything much lower than 10% off, and if any \"call for price\" iPod store was giving away iPods at 20% off or more, everybody would be buying from there.","retrieved_on":1473809439,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw3tr","parent_id":"t3_w2cf","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NewSc2","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52088-dd0ca29f-d9fb-437b-b8de-c0a90cbb399a-1566236778"}

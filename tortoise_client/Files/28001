The same goes for first-person shooters.\r\n\r\nThere are certainly lots of games which would benefit from larger viewports.\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure about first-person games, though. The Quake series of games, for example, have a user-adjustable field-of-view setting. It's possible to boost this, giving the game a fisheye-lens effect, cramming a wider field of view onto a single flat display. But you can only boost it a little before the distortions became fairly distracting. And playing the game set up this way feels *quite* odd; the distorted wide-angle view may work for a still photograph, but when you add motion and interaction, it [feels very weird](http://www.psychologie.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/ames_room.html).\r\n\r\nI think a proper wide-angle display is going to require a curved screen, or multiple screens to approximate a curve.","retrieved_on":1473809701,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cwhom","parent_id":"t1_cwgwj","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Lagged2Death","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59143-b79a0405-fbd6-4940-b41d-f8b20340016a-1566236780"}

I was in the fast lane on the express way because apparently I was going to have to veer left soon. However, the slow lane was more than clear should anyone want to pass me that way. Some fuck started tailgating me anyway and for reasons unbeknownst to me; he refused to pass me in the slow lane. So, I reduced my speed.\r\n\r\nNo, you are the entire fucking problem on our interstate system. Slower traffic is supposed to be on the right, and it is not safe to pass on the right. She ought to move over allow people to pass. That's how they do it on the autobahn, and that's why the autobahn is safe.\r\n\r\nI can't believe any of you would defend her. Her behavior of *intentionally* causing traffic accidents is *incredibly reckless*. She wouldn't be such a smart ass bitch if she caused a 10 car pileup, or if her and her victim got wiped out by a semi. Not to mention she is causing everyone to pay  more for insurance.\r\n\r\nWhat she is doing is much more illegal, costly, and dangerous than tailgaters trying to pass your slow ass.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808124,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u62g","id":"cu6e1","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17211-41562ce4-e100-428d-a2b7-e74771c22586-1566236763"}

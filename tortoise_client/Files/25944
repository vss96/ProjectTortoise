{"controversiality":0,"body":"Habitat borrowers have 25% to 50% of the local median income. So usually they just earn enough to make ends meet and don't have much tangency with financial business.\r\n\r\nWhen, all of a sudden, they own a relatively big pile of money and have to look after how to manage it, they still are total newbies on that kind of soil.\r\n\r\nOther home owners usually have a history of gaining or at least managing the wealth that paid for the house.\r\nThus they are to be expected less susceptible to predatory traps than the less experienced Habitat beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nIt's basically the difference between children and adults. For these despicable mortgage lenders, that certainly equals a target on their backs. Easy prey.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t66j","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165014177,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"zeco","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cta1m","id":"ctaii","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807527,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2375-6eab8018-4346-4573-b166-d8824f6b2901-1566236758"}

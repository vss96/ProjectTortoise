He'll only not teach history and shove his beliefs down the classes' collective throats on tuesday and thursday? \r\n\r\nWhat the teacher did violates separation between church and state. It is not up to the teacher to stray from History off into science, and then mock some of the most fundamental building blocks of modern scientific reasoning. \r\n\r\nWhat the child did, which was obtain evidence (intelligent for him to do so, by the way, since nobody believes teenagers anymore) to support his side. He then took it to the proper authorities (the school board and his parents). \r\n\r\nThe story is here is that other children are so misguided that they've issued death threats against their friend for not just sitting around and blindly believing whatever their teacher told them. Even when he singled out a muslim classmate as \"going to hell\". \r\n\r\nThere's no way you can really 'correct' a teacher that's crossed the line that far. The teacher should be dismissed. Since the public isn't in uproar, the school board thinks it can get away with NOT dismissing him (and earn a few favors from the teacher's union). This cannot be the case, this teacher needs to go. \r\n\r\nAnd thank you for attributing 'patriotic duty' to 'liberal'. Its about time people connected the two. Like how I'm connecting 'conservative' and 'nutbag' or 'evangelical christian'.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166454223,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35850-1fdf680a-7852-40b0-a016-f3df8ac8a74c-1566236771"}

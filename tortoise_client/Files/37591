I've used both Rails and Django and while I won't comment on Rails right now, I'll say that everything about Django is about a simple as it gets.\r\n\r\nYou map your URLs with regular expressions (and unless you've got legacy URLs to maintain, they don't get complicated), and each URL maps to a view function. The view function in turn either redirects or generates some type of response. It really is that simple. I found absolutely nothing about Django complex.\r\n\r\nAnd if you did find it complex, Django has the best documentation for any of the newer web frameworks.\r\n\r\nWe probably shouldn't even get started on generic views. Everything about them is simple, easy, and powerful. Last week I was able to cut-down on the code of an app by 2/3rds by simply using generic views wisely. And they cover all of your basic use cases (CRUD, login, logout, list, details, etc), and they are very flexible.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.b-list.org/weblog/2006/11/16/django-tips-get-most-out-generic-views\r\n\r\nIs there an area in particular that you found complex?","link_id":"t3_tsel","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807864,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctsgx","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctsgk","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10694-e92fb30b-de9a-430c-bc4e-5909ff46a295-1566236761"}

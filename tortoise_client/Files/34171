We get a better bit-torrent, bit-torrent gets money, and the MPAA gets screwed because they obviously don't know how bit-torrent works in the first place. So everyone wins.\"\r\n\r\nThis deal isn't for the better. UTorrent will go from THE best Bittorrent client, to being just another marketing machine for Warner Music or whoever Bram Cohen associates with. Do you know the MPAA actually puts up \"fake\" torrents on tracker sites to keep track of Bittorrent users and god knows what. So yeah, it's a win situation for the uTorrent developer (when you think about it, he could have continued to maintain uTorrent as a small, reliable Bittorrent client or just joined forces with the actual creator of Bittorent and reap in the benefits) and MPAA but not for the user. While I have to say uTorrent is still, currently, the best Bittorrent client out there - I'm pretty sure now some other client will most likely fill in the gap of uTorrent, or perhaps Azureus will step up and take that place.","ups":-1,"score":-1,"created_utc":1165547651,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15218-66dd9911-b10d-4428-b9b7-07b483495af5-1566236762"}

Many investments can survive a declining dollar (bare necessities are often cited as an example) and many stocks thrive in a declining dollar (precious metals and companies with a substantial foreign presence, which is why Japan and China try to keep their currency cheap).  Beyond that, for very many reasons a lot of these investments are much more easily available to the rich than the poor.\r\n\r\nA nuclear bomb exploding (pretty inarguably, I'd say) pretty much sees no winners.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing you made your pithy comment in response to my Katrina analogy.  In which case, I'd find it pretty naive and insensitive for you to imply that the rich and the poor saw equal impact.  Especially since the neighborhoods hit hardest were the urban areas (poor) as opposed to say, the Garden District (wealthy).  Or the fact that bankers and traders (wealthy) all over were able to profit greatly over the natural gas / oil shortage caused by the disaster (and guess who bears the most burden by increasing the costs of necessities?).  Or maybe, as I said in my own comment, that those wealthy who were hit were insured to the hilt, while the poor likely lost all of their (admittedly perhaps few) possessions.\r\n\r\nI think you're just being a troll (and I don't know why you got upvoted), but there's actually a pretty reasonable economic explanation for this (odd since your s/n is \"econo\").  Economically, every time you raise fixed costs, it hurts most those with the lowest variable costs (or revenue / profit).  Why?  Because those increased fixed costs eat into the margins more quickly.\r\n\r\nEcon lesson:\r\n\r\nSay two airlines operate 100 flights and one profits $50 and one profits $100.  Say the fixed cost per flight goes up $6 / flight.  Both airlines lose, but one's run into the red while the other's become merely \"less profitable\" (and may even *benefit* since A may close operation and give B more business).  It's a simple example, but makes the point.\r\n\r\nA declining dollar acts like an increased cost [on foreign goods and services].  The wealthy can scale back on luxury goods (they are, after all, luxury), meaning the poor will be hurt by fixed cost increases just like the airline example.  A rich person simply becomes \"less rich\", the poor person risks destitution / poverty / whatever.\r\n\r\nThe other point is each of those first $20,000 is worth much more in Qual. of Life terms than any dollar after that.  Doing anything to erode some of Person A's first $20,000 and Person B's $500,000 at some flat rate hurts A more because it taxes *critical* income.  And what's this about a flat tax being a regressive tax?","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tkm9","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165295951,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8353-96ed14dc-32e1-43f2-b846-8d55f0d520f6-1566236760"}

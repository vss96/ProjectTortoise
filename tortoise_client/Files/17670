Basically, any of the reasons you would hope a mistrial would be declared.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I was thinking more along the lines of personal responsibility for the juror.  I.e., someone accusing him of JN and trying to get him into trouble.  I don't think I have heard of an individual who voted their conscience being questioned.\r\n\r\nIt would cause a lot of national debate if JN got to the point judges were routinely setting aside jury verdicts with no solid reason except \"the jury failed to enforce the law\".  I don't think the legal system would get that far out of whack since the right to a trial by jury is guaranteed but would that become a farce if the judge then routinely did whatever he wanted.\r\n\r\nEdited to add: I also don't think I have ever heard of a judge changing an verdict of innocent to guilty which is what would need to be done to overturn a JN decision.  It could happen but that would cause a real stink.  I would hope in that case the judge's decision would be overturned on some sort of appeal.","link_id":"t3_tw0u","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807995,"distinguished":null,"author":"coldwarrior","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctzfb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctxtc","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13808-b8cf7c67-31f0-46b6-91d6-cb26de07476a-1566236762"}

Both sides really.  \r\n\r\nA house is a place to live.   You can buy and sell at will (-6% realtors fees), but you need a place to live, so even if in theory your investment is going up, you can't actually lock in the gains because you end up having to roll them into the next place.\r\n\r\nAfter 30 years a house is yours, with no more rent.   If you are willing to live in one place for the rest of your life (and you plan on more than 30 years of life), the lack of rent can be nice in those latter years.   (but don't forget to pay your taxes)\r\n\r\nEverytime I've checked I've discovered that renters and homeowners end up about the same financially in the long run.    A house isn't as good an investment as stocks in the long run, but more money is going into it, so it works out.  \r\n\r\nThe housing bubble was worse in some areas than others.   In some areas rent is more than a similar housepayment.  (But remember rent includes all maintenance, use of the pool, and such things that are extra to a homeowner - if the homeowner wants them)    In others renting can be a lot cheaper.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w2wq","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809445,"author":"bluGill","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw44v","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w2wq","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52253-7068dc81-2b01-44ff-8107-394bba1a0735-1566236778"}

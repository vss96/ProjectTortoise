If you attack someone, fail to kill/injure them, and they defend themselves, you can't just turn tail and run and expect them to be unable to shoot back. The criminal fleeing the attack he instigated is no grounds for a murder change against the defender.\r\n\r\nThis is different than if the attacker surrenders. If the attacks raises his hands or otherwise indicates he doesn't intend to flee or fight, and Tony Martin still shoots him... that is a crime. But just running... no safety there. And there shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't that he had a TV in his arms. And before you try to argue that it was a non-violent crime, breaking into an occupied home in the middle of the night automatically carried the presumption of violence, it need not even be proved in court.\r\n\r\n&gt; Under UK law, Martin would have been acquitted if his life had been in danger \r\n\r\nUnder US law, assuming a non-asshole prosecutor, charges would never have been filed, let alone an indictment successful.\r\n\r\nOne should consider the circumstances of this case, an old man outnumbered in his own home, things are happening quickly, and he doesn't know whether he's going to die or not, can't know for sure. Even if they're running now, they'll be back, since they usually do return in the UK. What's to stop them? And then at trial, the survivor lays it on good, lying about how they were really running instead of taunting or terrorizing the old guy... and some oddball shot that catches the attacker as he spun around to take cover becomes a shot in the back. If I had been on the jury, he'd have been acquitted, or it would at least end in mistrial. Nothing short of credible evidence that they were shot after making an un-ignorable attempt at surrender would have me vote any other way.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u9bd","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808243,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cucsd","parent_id":"t1_cuba2","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20706-be51ae02-4332-4b80-adb4-2d3f2f8be0ed-1566236765"}

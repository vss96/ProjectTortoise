Corn meal for the snacks, corn sweateners for the soda, and corn feed for the dairy/meat.\r\n\r\nFresh vegtables and fruit prices will vary based on a couple items - labor costs and availability of product (as in natural disasters destroying crops).\r\n\r\nCorn and other grains are mechanically harvested.  Corn can be harvested, tranported, and stored in bulk.  Agri-business has this down to an art.  Fresh vegetables and fruits can not.  They are dependant on cheap labor for harvesting and storage is short term, with very high spoilage rates in transport and storage.    In the USA, farm labor costs have risen over the last 20 years faster than other farm costs.  See this for more detail on California's farm labor cost (as an example):\r\nwww.ccis-ucsd.org/PUBLICATIONS/wrkg37.PDF\r\n\r\nSo, with an increase in farm labor costs and a general increase in demand, it is not surprising that the relative cost of fresh produce/fruits has increased versus other food groups shown in the graph.\r\n\r\nOne other item that I have noted....nothing scientific....but worthy of mention:  The traditional USA vegetable and fruit growing regions (California valleys, Washington apple regios, Florida vegetable areas, etc...) I have visited are being developed in to housing and retail use much faster than the corn growing regions that I visit (Iowa, Nebraska, etc...).  This loss of land might also explain some of the relative price change.  \r\n","created_utc":1165342716,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":2,"score":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_tol1","edited":false,"id":"ctq5t","author_flair_text":null,"author":"wylde21","retrieved_on":1473807821,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9458-60ef89a5-a944-49b1-87b0-e7a4f37cbfe2-1566236761"}

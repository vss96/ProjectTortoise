Peak oil theory has only an indirect relationship with the amount of oil in the world - what matters is the rate you can produce it, not how much there is.  Also, peak oil theory does not fail due to increasing technology - it appears to factor that in.  It is based on when oil discovery peaked (which it did in the 1960's).  Improving technology apparently is necessary to remain on the basic peak oil projected curve.\r\n\r\nThe political disruptions of the 70's and 80's, however, did seem to have an effect on the production curve that was not accounted for by the standard Hubbert peak oil projection.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14227-6dad15ca-54ae-43f0-90fb-e95fa8509803-1566236762"}

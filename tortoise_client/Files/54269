The truth is that the band exists, ergo it is a legitimate piece of information and should stay.  If the editors don't like things that get few hits, then they should grade them so that they don't appear at the top of the search results.  The more facts in the Wikipedia database, the more intelligent a search engine is required.  An excellent example is Google, it's the #1 search engine because it indexes the whole of the internet while still returning the desired matches.\r\n\r\nAll power to the Wiki :-)","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tfak","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807629,"distinguished":null,"author":"xaje","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_tfak","edited":false,"id":"ctfxb","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4853-e1ff59f0-1538-4a82-8a6b-c6161463e483-1566236759"}

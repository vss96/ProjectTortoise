Meat and pico de gallo wrapped in soft, warm, fresh corn tortillas.  YUM!  I will never go to Taco Bell again... unless - maybe - it's 2 am and I'm drunk off my ass.  It truly amazes me what we Americans think of as \"food.\"  Taco Bell isn't food, it's junk.  As is McDonald's, Wendy's, etc.  This article needs a link to the food article someone posted to reddit a couple days ago... [food of people around the world](http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair/2006/11/what_different_parts_of_the_wo.php)\r\n\r\nNote in the pictures how the Americans and the English are surrounded by junk and candy... sad.\r\n\r\nBy the way, elmuchoprez, I really appreciate you coming back, reading the comments, and writing back.  But watch out, because you'll get addicted to reddit in no time at all! :-)","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2814-ea87a989-cf44-4b32-9e78-966d78893b87-1566236759"}

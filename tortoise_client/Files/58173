{"controversiality":0,"body":"Stalinism doesn't meet crietria 1, 3, or 4. There are some similarities; fascism was a *response* to Marxism, after all, and consciously used some aspects of Marxism while turning others on their ears.\r\n\r\non point 1: Stalinism was based on class identity, not national identity. In practice there was also appeal to Russian chauvansim, but it was class that played the central role in Stalinsim that nationalism did in fascism.\r\n\r\non point 2: I'll give you this one. If you substitute \"the central identity\" for \"nation\", it works. So the only way you're wrong on point 2 is already covered in point 1.\r\n\r\non point 3: Stalinsim worked to obliterate traditional institutions as much as possible. That was an essential difference between communism (Stalinsist and otherwise) and fascism; fascism was both revolutionary and conservative while communism was entirely revolutionary.\r\n\r\non point 4: Stalinism was both violent and anti-democratic, but it didn't *glorify* violence, except under limited circumstances.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v1el","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166319098,"author":"BarkingIguana","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cv2j1","edited":false,"id":"cv2l0","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808729,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33145-2038c363-8cc0-4e6d-be66-8cf2bbfbba4c-1566236770"}

{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_378u","subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"This is probably among most important articles that could be posted to Reddit.  Climate change is NOW, and whether or not they are the perfect steps we need to take action NOW.\r\n\r\nMore information at Discover.com:\r\nhttp://www.discover.com/issues/dec-06/features/clean-coal-technology/\r\n\r\nWe are GOING to run into an energy crisis.  We are GOING to run into a climate change crisis (hell, we're already well down that road).  We are GOING to have to make decisions about what stopgaps we're going to take as we transition between What Has Come Before to What The Future Holds.\r\n\r\nChina and the US are going to need tremendous amounts of energy.  I don't like coal strip mines (living in Pennsylvania, I've seen my fair share of day fucking glo orange streams, devoid of life, poisoned for decades by King Coal).   I don't paticularly care for the idea of building huge amounts of nuclear power all over the world. \r\n\r\nI am absolutely enamored with the idea of mass local generation.  Solar fucking panels on every rooftop.  Even if it only reduced demand by 25 or 50%...that is 25 or 50%!!!\r\n\r\nBut, guess who's profits take a cut with that logical answer to our problems?  Yep, Southern Company, PPL, your local power supplier, etc etc.  Big Business who you KNOW aren't going to like consumers ripping dollars out of their pockets. \r\n\r\nCoal isn't the answer.  But I sure as HELL know that if they are going to build a conventional plant or an IGCC plant...I want the one that releases practically no pollution during electric generation.  Then we can go back and look at reducing coal consumption and furthering REAL solutions.\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1167272458,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_378u","id":"cw7k5","author_flair_text":null,"author":"gaso","retrieved_on":1473809512,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54167-16c39524-fe51-48b6-93ac-9bae2179f6d4-1566236779"}

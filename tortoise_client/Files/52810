What follows is a personal\r\nanecdote about how I think I may have cured my herpes.\r\n\r\nHaving had herpes since young adulthood (ah, the memories ;-), I\r\nnoticed that an outbreak is always (in my case at least), preceded by\r\nthe formation of a pustule or \"lump\" about the size of my thumb\r\nunderneath the skin of my left buttock, although I understand that the\r\nlocation and size varies from person to person. I've mentioned the\r\npustule to my dermatologist several times but he always says, \"Yes,\r\nthat's typical\" and does nothing about it.\r\n\r\nHypodermic syringes are prescribed for me because I inject\r\nmethotrexate and Humira for my psoriatic arthritis. One day I became\r\nso fed up with Herpes that with the help of my wife, and using one of\r\nmy hypodermic needles, I sucked most of the pus out of the pustule\r\nwith a needle and then injected about 0.2CC of Everclear, or just\r\nenough to fill the pustule and kill all the viruses that I assume were\r\ncontained within it. Note: For you Yankees, Everclear is essentially\r\nmodern day moonshine. ;-) It consists of 100% pure grain alcohol and\r\nis sold mostly in the Southern States in liquor stores. I had to\r\nsmuggle mine into California because Everclear is outlawed here. Any\r\ntype of strong alcohol, vodka, or other anti-viral solution would\r\nprobably work just as well as long as it's not contaminated with\r\nanything harmful. NEVER EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES INJECT ANYTHING\r\nINTO YOUR BODY THAT IS NOT COMPLETELY STERILE AND HARMLESS!\r\n\r\nIt's a good thing I was lying face down on the bed, because as soon as\r\nmy wife injected the alcohol into the pustule, I immediately spasmed\r\ninto a paroxysm of pain so intense that it totally paralyzed me for\r\nabout half an hour. After that I was able to walk a little, but not to\r\nsit. I wasn't able to sit for another three or four hours. The\r\nimportant thing however is that it WORKED! The pustule shrank to about\r\nhalf its original size almost overnight. Next I saw my dermatologist,\r\ntold him what I had done, and begged for a small vial of some type of\r\nanesthetic. That little vial of Lidocaine is one of my most treasured\r\npossessions, because it has saved me a tremendous amount of pain and\r\nsuffering since then.\r\n\r\nSince the pustule hadn't yet completely disappeared, I again injected\r\nit with a tiny bit more alcohol, but this time I first injected about\r\n0.05CC of Lidocaine and waited a few minutes for it to take effect\r\nbefore injecting the alcohol. The difference was amazing. There was no\r\npain AT ALL, so the moral is to try to convince your physician to do\r\nthis procedure in his office using a local anaesthetic in order to\r\navoid the hellacious pain.\r\n\r\nA few days later, another smaller pustule formed nearby the location\r\nof the original pustule. I zapped it in the same fashion as the\r\noriginal pustule, but this time thankfully using a tiny bit of\r\nLidocaine to make everything painless. In another two or three days, a\r\nvery tiny almost unnoticeable soft lump formed nearby the location of\r\nthe second pustule which by then had disappeared. I also zapped it\r\nwith the tiniest bit of Lidocaine and alcohol that I could measure\r\nout. No more pustules occurred after that.\r\n\r\nI typically had three or four herpes outbreaks each year, but it has\r\nbeen almost a full year since my wife and I performed this procedure\r\non myself and I have not had a single outbreak of any type of Herpes\r\nat all anywhere since then. It's premature to say that I'm \"cured\",\r\nbecause it's always possible the disease will return, but unless and\r\nuntil that happens, I am very happy with the results of my\r\nself-experimentation.\r\n\r\nMy worst fear is that this may actually be a real honest-to-goodness\r\npermanent cure for herpes that the medical profession will totally\r\nignore because they didn't think of it first, so I urge everyone to\r\ndiscuss this with your doctors and to encourage them to give it a try,\r\nbecause it just may work for you.\r\n\r\nI will not be checking back with this forum frequently, so if anyone\r\nwants to discuss this with me personally, or if someone stumbles\r\nacross this message in the future and wants to reach me, I have\r\ncreated a special email address at which I may be reached. The email\r\naddress is: HERPES at SPAMEX.COM\r\n\r\nBest wishes to all,\r\n\r\nRon Dotson\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nIf I start getting any Spam at the email address above, I will delete it.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v0p3","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808692,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"RKBA","edited":false,"id":"cv0p6","parent_id":"t3_v0p3","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32343-a3d4633b-3d5d-478c-999f-896da25be555-1566236770"}

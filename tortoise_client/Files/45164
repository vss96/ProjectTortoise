I don't care if Clippy has to pop up and say \"You look like you're creating a database.  Would you like to do so in an app designed for it?\"  Anything that gets business to stop using spreadsheets as databases will increase productivity like crazy.\r\n\r\nIdeally the app would truly be combined.  Even very smart people who can learn VBA for Excel and write macros never bother to learn Access because they are never ever *required* to open it up at any point in their careers, which is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nOh, and the Office Killer version of Access shouldn't suck either.  If someone can get that right then the word processor is easy, and PowerPoint should just be a clone.

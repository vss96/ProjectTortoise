This skew changes with the temperature of the crystal inside your PC. If you can make a given computer hot or cold the skew changes.\r\n\r\n2) A computer running TOR can be made hot from the outside sending a given kind of packets.\r\n\r\nSo given this two facts you can use 1 to check the computer FOOBAR clock skew, then use 2 to make it hot *if it is running TOR* and then use 1 again to check if the skew changed.\r\n\r\nHping implements the half 1 of the attack now.\r\nActually I don't know the tor protocol, but it's possible that hping can send the packets needed to make the CPU of a computer running TOR hot.\r\n\r\nWas my original message off topic? Is it worth down-moderation?","ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167480297,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cwgaj","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwf2a","author":"antirez","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809675,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58553-e0f13fcc-eb70-484c-839e-97ee83a5ae32-1566236780"}

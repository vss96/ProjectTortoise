Take a look at [my reddit profile](http://reddit.com/user/smacfarl/) and my voting history which is public. This is obviously not the case.\r\n\r\nNow please stop making allegations and address the facts.\r\n\r\nWhat we agree on. \r\n\r\n1. There are multiple factions in politics who scheme against each other. \r\n\r\n2. Media releases such as Op-Eds are a venue for selling these faction's agendas to the public or other interested parties.\r\n\r\n3. Leverett's Op-ed advances the agenda of one or more faction.\r\n\r\nThese things have nothing to do with the value of his actual statements which you have yet to address directly.\r\n\r\nNow you have cited [a second hand reference to a Daily Kos diary entry from Maccabee](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/12/13/11744/528) who makes  a personal assertion that.\r\n\r\n&gt;That said, I now believe that  the entire Iraq Study Group was sponsored by the Saudis to limit the damage that Bush 43 causes in the long term.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that Baker's sole purpose for the ISG is to play sock puppet to an unhappy Saudi family, is quite controversial and not in anyway justified by evidence in this diary entry. It is also a gross over simplification.\r\n\r\nSecond you site a diary entry discussing a 1/24/06 Op-Ed by Leverett, [which can be found in its entirety at the Brookings Institute web site.](http://www.brookings.edu/views/op-ed/fleverett/20060124.htm)\r\n\r\nNow this web site's analysis of the now year old Op-Ed starts off with a completely false allegation that Leverett's initial assertion is itself a whole cloth fabrication. \r\n\r\n&gt;Leverett argues Iran offered to assist in the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 \"and establish a new political order in Afghanistan.\" In return, in 2002, Bush labelled Iran a member of the Axis of Evil in his State of the Union address.\r\n\r\n&gt;Blaming Bush's mistakes is easy, however, **his claims are ludicrous.** Why would the United States ask one militant Islamic regime (Iran) to help destroy another militant Islamic regime (Afghanistan)? There is much to be said about cooperation, but the US does not need to worry that the Brits are going to go on a mass Islamic campaign. The Brits also haven't been shouting \"death to America\" since 1979, and militarily cooperating with the Brits is not completely unprecedented and a possible security risk.\r\n\r\n&gt;It's one thing to have a verbal endorsement. It's quite another to militarily ally with a country America does not even have diplomatic relations with, which chants \"Death to America\" and wants to destroy America's ally Israel.\r\n\r\nThis is just dead wrong. We know that the US had long established a 6+2 commission of Afghanistan's neighbors for meetings in the region, Iran being one of those neighbors was on the commission. We also know for a fact that in 2001 that Jim Dobbins the veteran State Department Diplomat met with the representatives of each nation in committee in Bonn Germany. He then got an agreement from all parties which led to a UN meeting in November 2001 with a presentation made to Colin Powell. We also know that at this time Iran went after al-quaeda groups in the NE of Iran along the Afghan border, and rounded them up preemptively, to aide the US in the war on terror. [You can get many more of these details from Raw Story's summary of contents of the redacted publicly available information.](http://reddit.com/info/vtfa/comments)\r\n\r\nThese are all facts. These events happened, they are verifiable. They appear in the NYT but were also documented in other papers of record as well as by the organizations involved.\r\n\r\nThe blog diarist then continues to refute reality by denying the existence of the comprehensive Iran/US settlement that was shuttled by Swiss diplomat from Geneva to the US, because Leverett does not give us the source of his knowledge of this event. Since Leverett is a veteran CIA Iran specialist and his wife is a diplomat this is understandable, unlike the diarist who doesn't publish his real name and is at this point dead wrong on his first two assertions.\r\n\r\nThe diarist is equally dismissive of the rest of Levertt's claims and proposals with equally little support other than his own feelings, and then concludes with what is currently the neo-con hard line view of Iran as the \"certain truth\", about the situation. Nowhere in the entry does this diarist attempt to imply that Leverett is playing sock puppet to Iranian or Syrian interests. Rather he states that the Leverett's obvious goal of his Op-Ed is to establish normal diplomatic ties with Iran, which is unsurprising and entirely not controversial given that the real powers of Iran were and continue to actually reach out to the US. It is only through the current administration's relentless deamonizing of Iran that hardliners like Ahmadinejad gain power and legitimacy domestically within that country. And this feedback leads to more and more outrageous anti-Israeli propaganda on Ahmadinejad's part which fuels the fires of conflict in the larger region. When the comprehensive outreach to the US was made in 2002 there was a much more moderate Iranian President in power, who lost that power to the extremist in no small part to the actions of the Bush administration.\r\n\r\nThat you view either of these diarists as a legitimate source of information about the subject, given their over reliance on personal opinion which turns out upon analysis to just be dead wrong, is troubling.\r\n\r\nMy initial point, that despite the obvious multi-factional power struggles going on in the foreign policy arena, Team Bush/Cheney is censoring obvious and public truths about the US/Iran relation so that they can continue the disastrous and wrong headed foreign policy courses that they have set the nation upon - reality be damned, remains accurate. That a US administration would do this, and do it from a position of such wrongness is the beyond the pale, and the tragic meta-story beyond this Op-Ed.\r\n","retrieved_on":1473809253,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvtyu","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvtlh","author_flair_text":null,"author":"smacfarl","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47080-09325bfb-22cc-4c39-ba92-b57a1f6d6711-1566236775"}

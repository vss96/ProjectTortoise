So I just did some research and he was the guy who claimed to be 8th in line when there was only 7 PS3 at Walmart.  According to his story he poisoned the coffee of the 7 other persons before him with Exlax. Supposedly the 7 guys before him then left the line because they where shitting their pants. \r\n\r\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;ih=002&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&amp;viewitem=&amp;item=120054509305&amp;rd=1&amp;rd=1\r\n\r\nhttp://digg.com/gaming_news/Hilarious_PS3_line_story_sweet_sweet_revenge\r\n\r\nI hate people who scream fake at each news story but this guy seams prone to:\r\n\r\n1: Buy and sell consoles and related stuff for profit on eBay.\r\n\r\n2: Have an unbelievable story to tell on his auction about him teaching some urban legend sounding lesson to some one.\r\n\r\n3: Somewhat manage to get his auctions featured on Digg, Reddit or other.\r\n\r\nIf you still believe his story, please contact me, I have some very interesting [lunar real estate](  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/12/08/nasa_real_estate/ ) to sell for a very good price.  \r\n\r\nPS: He is also using a charity to promote and sell his worthless empty box. If you want to give to charity don't give him 80% of the money then 20% to charity, give directly 100% to charity and let him keep the empty box; That's what HE deserve for Christmas not your money.","score":47,"ups":47,"created_utc":1165621809,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17367-dba96ca7-e279-448c-a3a6-18e8dd12abac-1566236763"}

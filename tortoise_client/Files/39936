This allowed people to get into much more home than they could really afford.  It was based on the assumption that housing prices would just continue to rise at a high rate.  I just spoke to someone today who has an interest-only ARM that he took out on a house about 1.5 years ago.  His payments are rising rapidly (to his surprise) and he really doesn't make the kind of income needed to move over into a fixed-rate loan for the house, otherwise he would have gotten one in the first place.  He's a student working part-time on campus - I really can't see how he ever qualified to buy a house in the first place, let alone in a trendy district.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165814708,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cueb2","parent_id":"t1_cuea8","author_flair_text":null,"author":"UncleOxidant","retrieved_on":1473808272,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21610-1764fa7f-74ff-4b0f-88dc-176e85ed96e4-1566236765"}

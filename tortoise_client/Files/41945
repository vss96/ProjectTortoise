'Twas awesome.  Grabbed [a map from MDB](http://mdb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/m1/maps.htm) and tweaked it a bunch, fixing errors, adjusting the palette, etc.  I [uploaded it to my Photobucket](http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j192/nmessenger/met-zebesnormal.png).  Used it as my desktop for a couple weeks.  Memorized the whole thing.\r\n\r\nThe Mother Brain is a *royal bitch*.  Super Metroid MB's got nothing on her.  Y'ever tried fighting her without the Varia?  Now *there's* a rush!  The first time I tried I finished with 3 units of energy.\r\n\r\n***THREE!!!***\r\n\r\nOut of *SEVEN HUNDRED!!!!!*  I was *wired*, man!  I couldn't stop shaking for hours!  Grah!  And the shaft climb?  With the 'BEEP - BEEP - BEEP - BEEP - BEEP - You-have-less-than-30-energy-units - BEEP - BEEP - BEEP - You-are-going-to-die - BEEP - BEEP'.  *That* was nerve-wracking.

I must've played through the game a dozen times, tried the various [map hacks](http://mdb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/fanapps.htm), toyed with the [editor](http://www.datacrystal.org/wiki/Metroid:MetEdit).  Yeah, I was hopelessly obsessed.\r\n\r\n\\*drools\\*\r\n\r\nEdit: Wait, is this website about programming or something?\r\n\r\n\\*looks around\\*\r\n\r\n\\*flees\\*","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165181683,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5403-76a5459c-5eeb-4197-b8a3-5415a4d3a1a3-1566236759"}

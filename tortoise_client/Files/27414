If you order that army to take a certain action, it is like you pulled the trigger on that weapon and are responsible for that action. This goes for Bush as well as Saddam.\r\n\r\nWhether the person who pulls the actual trigger on the gun is a murderer is much more difficult. In the army in which I served you *had to* refuse to obey illegal orders (however, I have doubts about how well this would go down in war time). I suppose in Saddam's army disobeying orders would be equivalent to suicide. Another problem for the soldier on the ground may be lack of information, so it could be impossible to know whether the order was illegal.\r\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167523272,"score":8,"ups":8,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59299-b5082676-14e8-43db-b6c4-b9b03b4b1966-1566236780"}

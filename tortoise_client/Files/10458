If you are just here for reaction, then well done, you've got the tone just right.\r\n\r\nHaving an infant in a shower or bath on their own is more dangerous (they can slip and hit their heads, etc). So at that age you want at least one adult in there (you can use a seperate baby bath, but if you don't have one to hand or don't want to...). At which point they pretty much need to be naked too (conservative you might be - but would you really put on a bathing suit to bath/shower with your infant? If so, would you make sure they were wearing one?)\r\n\r\nNo-one wants to mix up infants or small children in sexual situations. But this isn't a sexual situation. So there really isn't a problem.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_utvb","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30938-1e44e535-cc6c-44c7-997f-094620d73ff4-1566236769"}

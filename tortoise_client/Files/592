{"body":"&gt; Conventional rules of thumb for what's stupid development practice often don't apply for strongly-typed functional languages.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, \"test it before you put it into production\" still holds in nearly all cases. Unless you can provide a rigorous formal proof of the correctness of the program (something that, even in a language like Haskell, is not generally feasible for non-trivial programs), you need to test it; without some confirmation of correctness, successful compilation is just successful compilation.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_twtt","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1165548963,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"ubernostrum","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctzx0","id":"cu2je","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808050,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15262-94adcede-57d8-42e5-8a86-db4ae047c65f-1566236762"}

If anything, its one of the first things you might ask someone you don't know when meeting them at a party or whatever to get a conversation started.\r\n\r\nThe difference I've noticed is most Americans are incredibly uptight - calling people \"sir\" and saying \"vehicle\" instead of car; basically it just has a very formal and sanitised feel to it all.  Compare that to the average person over here in the UK where we are much more relaxed about it all.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25801-9a7e4cae-639e-4e0c-a3d8-658fefaa1e9a-1566236767"}

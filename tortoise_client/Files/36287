Basically, in all cultures and religions you will find a sort of core moral base.  This base is deriveable from game theory - human cooperation.  It is evolutionarily advantageous to treat others well.\r\n\r\nI'm not even going to go into its details, there's a reason it takes a book.  There's so many preconceptions to clear up.\r\n\r\nSo, you might say we have achieved a level where we may escape evolutionary control.  I say we are still animals.  This fact is fairly apparent if you regularly attend a high school.\r\n\r\nEven then, you might ask why not do things which are apparently self serving, unmoral?  You will find that despite our advances in technology, the imputii upon which innate human morality has evolved remains much the same.  Often times following these moral guidelines is overall beneficial.  You are possibly rewarded with true happiness, our natural moral-enforcing drug.\r\n\r\nThis, at least, is my athiest religion.","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165388992,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctsah","id":"ctszj","author_flair_text":null,"author":"mgsloan","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807874,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10979-471a7cbc-0c88-4cb4-b000-1968aa4897ee-1566236761"}

But Christians refuse to acknowledge this fact.\r\n\r\nSo what? As the world turns, their desert cult of death and despair becomes more disbelievable all of the time. Their Jesus doesn't come back as expected, their God doesn't save their asses and they all die in vain.\r\n\r\nAs for the Book of Mormon, read the Turner's \"Shadow or Reality\" and it's worth turning a page or two. The obvious fabrication of the entire Moroni story is a clear rip-off of the bible text, which itself is a rip-off of ancient Sumarian history and other ancient texts.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vnhg","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44966-0b3e47b5-e25e-45b3-b49d-18d948ca9335-1566236774"}

{"controversiality":1,"body":"I always thought the idea of a moon base was a staging point for deep space missions. Launching from the moon would require a lot less fuel for a much larger payload and would allow us to reach farther into space or carry more into space with the same technology. On top of that, it allows for much better research into life in space and allows for greater preparedness of space travel. \r\n\r\nUnless we develop anti-gravity technology, which we very well might, the moon is a perfectly logical extension of our current space exploration.\r\n\r\nIs a prudent use of our resources? Impossible question to answer. Save the hungry with space money, but then get wiped out by a problem which we could have prevented had we known more about the universe. Many great discoveries have been accidental.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uhgq","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","created_utc":1165873969,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Draracle","id":"cuhmz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uhgq","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808335,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23312-ac7e3d33-11cd-411f-a0aa-3cb59533976d-1566236766"}

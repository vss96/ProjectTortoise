And you're more than welcome to listen to those for free, the quality's really good.\r\n\r\nAs for creative commons, that's just a method of licensing. It doesn't mean free. It just a certain set of very good licenses.\r\n\r\nI'm actually listening to some of the albums in Amarok now (which apparently got integration with magnatune in its latest version), and so far the experience has been so good and user friendly I may actually buy some tracks, at which point I know at least half the money I choose to give will go to the artist.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion, free good, supporting the artist, better, both are easy with Magnatune.","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166938582,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvwc1","parent_id":"t1_cvw40","author":"Grarg","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809299,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48221-7db156e4-299e-47ae-8a1a-d0e0640d53fc-1566236777"}

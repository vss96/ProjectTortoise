{"controversiality":1,"body":"&gt;\"The issue is not whether public schools are good or bad, but rather whether I am allowed to disagree with you without getting shot.\"\r\n\r\nYou can disagree and found a private school which would understandably be more in line with your views.  Given the current state of public education in the US your school would probably better prepare students for adulthood.  This is how your able to \"disagree\" with public schools without being \"shot\".  \r\n\r\nThis guy's real beef seems to be that he is forced to pay taxes for an educational system he doesn't support and can't change through democratic means (because 90% of other voters are too apathetic about school reform to research it's shortfalls on their own).  This doesn't mean that he would be shot however, tax evasion is punished by asset seizures and prison time (arguably dropping the soap could be worse than being shot).\r\n\r\nWhat everyone needs to remember is that removing the federal government (and thus it's maintenance of the status quo) from public schools we'd be turning half the schools in the nation into Jesus Camp.  From a libertarian perspective, and I do consider myself libertarian leaning philosophically, this would be acceptable in theory because the will of the people is important and I think smaller government is better government.  In practice however, on this issue, I donâ€™t want to see fundamentalist Creationism taught in half of American Classrooms.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u9xr","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165716641,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"author":"thevalarauk","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuadj","parent_id":"t3_u9xr","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808200,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19442-735269e6-0450-4491-92e1-73401522d1d0-1566236764"}

This is a case of people perpetrating this crime on others, not their own kids. \r\nThat, for me, is just as bad as any unscrupulous dealer or pimp elsewhere toying with young lives. You are suggesting that some people from these parts are vile or desperate enough to mutilate their own kids and set them out, and in making that subtle alteration of the truth you are being deceitful.\r\n\r\nEven given how child beggars are created, can you really link that behavior to sending kids out to steal with the hopes of having their fingers chopped off? The media picks up on a vile, but rare, incident. Rare enough that the punishment meted out isn't going to make it worthy of an entire enterprise surrounding it.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, you just brought up a fact (and a half-fact at that) for no good reason. \r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53337-c938653e-77a0-46e1-9a55-9c21cb658de1-1566236778"}

I know it might be foolish for me to ask for advice with a more complicated case like this online..... :~) however, when I take dexedrine I have lazer like focus but in two days I go absolutely psychotic... I feel I have to do masochistic things for atonement for great sins I've committed - (nothing too much more than your average run of the mill sinner - but at the time I'm convinced I must be punished).  This is before I went on clomipramine 150 mg since being on anafranil my OCD and delusions - if they are delusions are completely gone but I'm a vegetable.. I used to be a gifted pianist... and wanted to be a nurse practitioner...  My psychiatrist is really quite good, and said that once I am stabilized on clomipramine, he may be willing to try dexedrine again to see if I had the same reaction.  Currently I'm on abilify and find it helps with energy, OCD, and mood stability.  Do think it's possible that now on the clomipramine and Abilify I might be more immune to dexedrine's side effects.\r\n\r\nThank you","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808123,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cu6c2","parent_id":"t3_u6b9","edited":false,"author":"bentley79","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17173-a16aec38-92c4-4d9e-9e2d-070ffd53e24f-1566236763"}

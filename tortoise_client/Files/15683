{"body":"First, Objective C - for Mac OS X development, because it is simple and elegant and Cocoa is great framework. Because it is based on C, you can access easily any API - Carbon, OpenGL etc. For real wold apps you must use some of these hard to use C APIs.\r\n\r\nSecond, AppleScript - because you can do amazing stuff with few lines of AppleScript, or waste hours trying to write poorly documented AppleEvents code. You can embed AppleScript in Objective C code or bundle helper scripts.\r\n\r\nFor anything else: Python because it is so much easier and faster to use.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_vzw8","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167117959,"author":"nirs","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vzw8","id":"cw1fl","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809394,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50832-796b2fb1-a373-449a-bc7f-57be02c906ec-1566236778"}

And yet no one ever complains that Paris is boring or monotonous. Dirty, mean-tempered, sure, but never bland.\r\n\r\nThe entire city was master-planned and narrowly regulated by Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann, Napoleon III's city modernization planner, who set stringent guidelines for architects and builders to follow. It gradually replaced the seedy, filthy, virulent, medieval city with something that was at once modern, sanitary, commercially viable, and yet consistent with its own architectural and cultural history.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine a city planner today with either the audacity to undertake a transformation so major or the sheer competence to do it in such a way that the end result is an *improvement*? Instead we're stuck with myopic single-use zoning, minimum parking requirements, hideously functional steel and concrete boxes surrounded by acres of asphalt, prefab pressboard and vinyl mchouses, and ridiculous monuments to architects' egos, all working strictly at odds with the most basic requirements of a person trying to *live* in an urban environment.","link_id":"t3_uga5","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165868486,"score":28,"ups":28,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23098-8e204aeb-6f34-45dd-8aef-bdf0bbb7e05d-1566236766"}

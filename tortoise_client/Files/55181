{"controversiality":1,"body":"Where do you come up with such BS that a husband has the right to kill his wife (or sister) if he suspects that she has been \"immoral\", that this is \"completely legal, and often encouraged\"?! All those \"honour killings\" that I ever heard of there were persecuted by the authorities and then the \"criminal\" featured in the crime section of their newspapers. \r\n\r\nAnd where did you come up with the idea that there is \"no lower limit to female marriage age\"? The Islamic one is puberty, which I personally, as an atheist Westerner, think is far more sensible, it being natural and biological, than an arbitrary age nonsense. But anyhow, the Arab countries in general have the highest \"lower limit to female marriage age\", it being 20 in Tunisia.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tn5t","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165345101,"author":"ooouuuurrrriiiii","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctqe2","parent_id":"t1_ctpmj","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807825,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9560-17404728-abbf-4e57-9794-78b81adfb8b1-1566236761"}

{"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_tm90","stickied":false,"body":"&gt; Dustin Diaz of Yahoo makes that point well in the linked comment thread by referring to Yahoo Mail -- you basically can't build a rich web-based application like that without relying on JavaScript\r\n\r\nYes, you can.  People confuse two separate issues - the interface and the functionality.  The best and most compatible way of building a web application like this is to implement it without JavaScript, and then write the JavaScript to manipulate the pages to work how you want.  That way you:\r\n\r\n* get it working for everybody - including the Netscape 3 users,\r\n* don't have to mess around with two versions of the site, one of which will inevitably be neglected,\r\n* don't screw up the interface with things like javascript: links where you can't be sure *all* of the JavaScript will be executed.\r\n* retain compatibility for those people with partial JavaScript functionality, like Internet Explorer users with ActiveX switched off (no Ajax for those guys).\r\n\r\nNow there are a few applications where this isn't possible.  But that's when *the functionality itself* relies on JavaScript.  For instance, the MS Paint clone somebody linked to on Reddit a couple of days ago couldn't work like this.\r\n\r\nBut the thing is, things like webmail - and actually the vast majority of web applications - *don't* have functionality that requires JavaScript.  They use JavaScript to improve the interface - which is perfectly fine of course, but that's no reason to make it mandatory.","controversiality":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165318632,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctncg","id":"ctohu","author":"Bogtha","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807790,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8710-159b591e-d5ff-491b-a13f-48ca43448433-1566236760"}

More prone to crime, less monogamous, less intelligent. (Keep in mind that the KKK actually heavily borrowed from the eugenics movements of the early 20th century.)\r\n\r\n2) The races, even though they arose quite naturally, are a thing that is worth preserving. Mixing races is wrong, and will leave humanity less diverse.\r\n\r\n3) It's not about race at all, but rather a decadent ghetto culture that needs to be wiped out. Rap and hip-hop and gangsta and ebonics. These hurt people, including those white people who get caught up in it. We need to destroy this culture.\r\n\r\nThey'd have more and less militant versions of those excuses, polished up in the right ways for whomever the audience was. But lack of religion... that wouldn't even slow them down.\r\n\r\nThis goes for ever single bad thing in history. \r\n\r\n&gt;Hint: that means that I don't disagree with you.\r\n\r\nMaybe you don't, but every single one of my comments is being modded down, even while the replies are being modded up. But remember, folks, this brand of atheism is all about thinking reasonably, not about being overly emotional and just reacting, right?","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_vx8t","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167001405,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49114-1795e902-5032-4c8d-b857-75a01e4da569-1566236777"}

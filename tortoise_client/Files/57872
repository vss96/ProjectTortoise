I don't remember anyone saying that...\r\n\r\n[Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech#Germany) are well known for having laws against things like holocaust denial.  [David Irving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving) was jailed for three years in Austria for being branded a holocaust denier.  France have banned denial of the armenian genocide. Britain never had freedom of speech for citizens (as opposed to politicians) until the EU forced it upon them.  The [McLibel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLibel) case is an example of how difficult it is in Britain to say anything meaningful at all without giving your opponents the opportunity of financially destroying you.\r\n\r\nEurope has lots of good things going for them in comparison to the US, but freedom of speech is not one of them.","score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166886701,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvuj7","parent_id":"t1_cvug9","author":"acrophobia","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809264,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47302-982b419d-62b1-48e2-9bf5-b16116751491-1566236775"}

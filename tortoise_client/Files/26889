The catch is though that everyone wants to do beer, so they give it to the people with the most seniority. That means you might have to spend ten or more years selling cracker jacks before you get to move up. \r\n\r\nAs for the economics, a 20 oz beer costs an average of $5.24 in major league baseball and each person is allowed to buy a maximum of two over the course of a game. This works out to selling 238 beers a game to make 100k in raw numbers, but really probably more like 350 because you are taking in some percentage of the profit. That is very difficult, because it means you'd have to be selling like two beers a minute in a three hour game, which is almost but not quite impossible.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, it can really happen, but it's not at all easy.","link_id":"t3_u476","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808130,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Alex3917","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu6e0","id":"cu6oc","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17400-016df341-2e1a-436f-b91d-f61a4f8643e6-1566236763"}

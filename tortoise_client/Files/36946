Wrong. Credit card companies have a cutoff as to how low their interest rates will go.\r\n\r\nSo when interest rates are low for lending, that doesn't mean your credit card rate will be low as well. If you don't know, or aren't sure, if your credit card company has a minimum interest rate just look at the fine print on your next credit card bill. If you can't read that small of print, and most of us can't, give the customer service a call. If your credit card company does have a minimum interest rate then I'd plan to look around and go with the credit card companies that don't. Because when the interst rates drop, you should get a break on your credit card rate.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54475-f2b245af-0b5e-41e9-b4b5-9b3c3dcd5fd9-1566236779"}

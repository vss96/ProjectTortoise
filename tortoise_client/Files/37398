Can't foo.html simply be the pathinfo of the URL with a service responding on / that processes the request?\r\n\r\nThe article explains this but maybe not clearly enough. A POST should occur against a URI that leads to a process that will handle the incoming requests headers/body.  So if you compare http://www.example.com/foo.html and http://www.example.com/pageCreator.php you understand easily that the former one wouldn't process a POST whilst the latter would. Technically nothing prevents you from processing from an HTML page as in the first example bu this goes against the HTTP (REST) principles. So in summary POST on a generic URI that will create a resource (or not) and PUT against a URI of a resource that already exists (after a POST). Read the Atom Pub. protocol spec for a good review of this.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167384301,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t3_wc4o","id":"cwcbx","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473809601,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56508-67cdc1a3-a8c7-4aed-88a2-a981e6a469e2-1566236779"}

Sound is just the movement of particles.  When they move in air, they move the air.  These air movements reach our ears... yada yada.  If we reduce it to the basic principle of movement then yes... to some degree it appears movement is what allows matter to exist at all.  Even at the low temperatures of BEC, a particle cannot wholly stop moving.\r\n\r\nThe \"word\" being the impetus that began creation is not just a biblical idea.  Naming things in order to create them is at the heart of several origin myths.  There is a more common interpretation of the \"word\" as creation tool.  Language is what gives our conscious minds structure.  Once something is named, we re-create it as a sort of symbol within a web of symbols within our minds.  Language, whether it be written, verbal, internal dialog, or unpronounceable symbols, is how we create our internal world and our internal map of the external world.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v3ot","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166393430,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34536-4f841526-1b5f-4aa5-9a06-2f90cb4de6d7-1566236771"}

Alternatively, it may fly over the very high mountains of the [Nanga Parbat - Haramosh Massif](http://www.albany.edu/geosciences/nangap/introd97.html). (Nanga Parbat is the ninth-highest mountain in the world). Then it has to lose altitude quickly, descending into a deep valley, with mountain walls in every direction. \r\n\r\nPhotographs:\r\n\r\n* [Approach to Skardu airport - large image](http://www.caravanpilots.com/IMG_4428.JPG). \r\n* [Approach to Skardu airport - different photo, low-res](http://www3.telus.net/public/aschoepp/_graphics/travels/pak_ind/skardu.jpg), which is just visible in the center of the photo.\r\n* [Google maps link](http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;q=&amp;om=1&amp;z=12&amp;ll=35.328571,75.531006&amp;spn=0.11176,0.233459&amp;t=k).

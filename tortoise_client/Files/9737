{"controversiality":0,"body":"I was in elementary school in the mid 90s and was in much the same position. I was penalized for reading ahead in my texts, and eventually was put on ritalin to force me to pay attention or something.\r\n\r\nNaturally this exacerbated my underlying mental issues (my parents had gotten divorced a few years earlier and my family life pretty much went to hell with no parents and family who didn't care about anything I did), and I became completely socially withdrawn and spent the next ten years failing most of my classes while testing in the 90+% percentile on all of the state exams.\r\n\r\nBefore conforming to a social system you should ask yourself if what the system is asking of you is reasonable. If it is not then you should rebel and refuse to conform because being able to respect yourself and live true to your inferences is a hell of a lot more important than caving in to social expectation.\r\n\r\nThe American style of public schooling is flawed. My experience (and it appears I am not alone) has been that it glorifies conformity over original thought. This is an unfortunate consquence of a few fundamental attributes of the system; original thought is difficult to grade and test for, and the insistence upon teaching all children of the same age the same things in a fixed time essentially requires testing superficial memorization.\r\n\r\nAnd this is why I disagree with your conclusion that people who follow the rules and conform to the school system's expectations are more intelligent and fufilled. If anything I think they suffer from the ignorance of not knowing that there is anything better in life. Ignorance is oft mistaken for bliss; being intelligent usually results in unhappiness as you see the inertia of a world gone mad around you that you have no power to change.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ut1n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166209688,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"unknown_lamer","id":"cuy2o","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuxoe","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808644,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31139-26a4c124-c957-4a7b-8a24-9a7caee6ff4f-1566236769"}

Societies protect the common good by protecting the weak from being exploited by the strong and the stupid by the smart.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries from exploitation to normal transactions aren't always obvious, but they are there and people have chosen to honour them because living under the heel of some petty lord isn't conductive to personal freedom or the common good. It's nice for the smartest and strongest few, sure, but not for the rest.\r\n\r\nIs it empathy?

They seem to have been afraid that Saddam would somehow manage to survive, perhaps by cutting a deal. By refusing to hand him over until it was time to kill him, they ensured he got the treatment they wanted.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe Bush was just feeling homesick for Texas:\r\n\r\nQuoth Ron White \"In the state of Texas, if you kill someone and three or more credible witnesses see you do it, you don't wait on death row for 15 years. Oh no, you go straight to the front of the line, Jack! Some states are trying to abolish the death penalty. My state's putting in an express lane.\" \r\n\r\nAt least they didn't make the hangmen wear ten gallon hats...\r\n\r\nOn a more serious note, given Saddam's former CIA ties,\r\nhttp://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article2849.htm ,\r\nperhaps other potential allies of U.S. rulers might consider these sorts of ties a bit suffocating.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_whh2","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167543913,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59722-c141644c-bdb1-4bbe-bbc9-305a3f552536-1566236780"}

Before I had the requisite cognitive leaps that lead to a better understanding of Monads in general and IO in particular, I found do-notation to be an obstacle to learning.  Writing the binds and lambdas myself was essential to my fully grokking the things.\r\n\r\nNow that I'm more comfortable with the mechanics behind it, I find do-notation to be a useful shorthand.  I definitely wouldn't recommend a beginner use it, though.  Too much of a false friend.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_ujjo","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","ups":5,"score":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165925281,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24576-590167d0-c1d4-49e0-8a3e-8478bb45746d-1566236767"}

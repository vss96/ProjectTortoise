Configuration can't be done from within the database (ACLs), upgrades always require a dump and reload, and there's a number of small features that just don't exist in PostgreSQL yet.\r\n\r\nI'm testing an upgrade from 7.4.x to 8.1.x.  In order to do this, you need to have both versions installed, do a dump using the 8.1 client connected to the 7.4 server, then restore from the 8.1 client into the 8.1 server.  What kind of nonsense is this?  MySQL doesn't have any of these problems.  Upgrades are handled rather gracefully (while we do dumps before upgrades, they're not required).  From within the MySQL cli, I can set up access controls and create some pretty secure multiuser databases.  PostgreSQL?  Edit a file and reload - oh, and the file better be correct or else postmaster will barf and refuse all connections, not just the one you messed up.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vzbb","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809380,"author":"enry","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw0mh","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vzbb","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50362-4581ce15-874d-45a3-a6b1-3ef654cee9ed-1566236778"}

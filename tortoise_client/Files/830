{"controversiality":0,"body":"Carter is Right!  People here do not know the history of the region and the critical importance of finding peace between Israel and Arabs.  The Bush administration has agitated their conflict by their one-sided approach.  \r\n\r\nThe pro-Israel lobby is very strong here in the US and they have all our politicians in their pockets.  Its is sad to know that millions of Americans think Israel is a peace loving nation that is a victim.\r\n\r\nOur boys are dying fighting the wars Israel's started.  When will we wake up as a Nation and stop taking sides on this issue and deal with objectively with both Arabs and Israelies.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u5pd","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165627367,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"atothek302","edited":false,"id":"cu6wa","parent_id":"t3_u5pd","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808134,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17532-4b93748e-7401-4455-bf45-b8bbde5fdc19-1566236763"}

Without that limitation, you would have a 1/512 chance. Adding more images (say a 4x4 grid) could increase that to 1/65535 which is in my opinion getting into the range where brute force becomes very unattractive, especially when combined with some kind of lockout timer.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the major problem with KittenAuth is the same as the question-auth -- you have a limited database. Without huge numbers of images, or large numbers of new images going in on a regular basis, the spammers can manually record which ones are actually kittens, and then just compare the known images with the displayed images and significantly increase their odds if not solve the puzzle altogether.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25518-43b70aa5-94a9-4007-8983-0e5bb276ac31-1566236767"}

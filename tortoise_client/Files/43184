A crime is a crime.\r\n\r\n2) Everything you've said supports my original thesis: \"Children have no rights in this country.\" It appears that you believe that should be the case. Fine.\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\nI happen to disagree vehemently, mostly on the definition of \"child\". For most of human history, and in many places still today, adulthood began with puberty. America currently has a horribly unfair legal system for minors. They can be tried as adults but cannot legally vote. Upon age 18, they can invariably drive, vote, smoke, own and discharge firearms, perform citizen's arrests, fly airplanes, and die in wars, but they cannot drink alcohol. In essence, we burden post-pubescent teenagers with the responsibilities of an adult but nearly none of the associated rights. This is an injustice. Forget gay rights - look at how we're treating our children. People who think that \"human life begins at conception\" tend to be the biggest hypocrites about this sort of thing.","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13466-0efea5de-f525-44b7-9d47-f62f50c42e70-1566236762"}

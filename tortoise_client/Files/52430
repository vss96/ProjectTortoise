The problem is political and economic, not technical or environmental.\r\n\r\nFor the last 60 years or so we have been subsidising our farmers through the CAP to the point that they produce crops at below cost and well below the market price. These products are in excess of our requirement and so are dumped on the international markets, thereby massively depressing the price due to the oversupply.\r\n\r\nThe poorest farmers elsewhere in the world are unable to compete with these prices and stop farming, allowing their land to fall into disuse. Should there then be a drought or other problem, there is no excess farming capacity to feed the population. Famine is the result.\r\n\r\nFood aid then flows into the drought area, destroying any remaining food markets and forcing the rest of the farming population off the land, thereby requiring aid for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nGM crops themselves have problems with Intellectual Property, cross pollination and patents, but otherwise seem to be harmless. They are however absolutely not the solution to poverty or world hunger. It shows that Professor Anne Glover is at best naive, at worst she is working for the interests of the pro GM lobby, something of a conflict of interests in a government adviser.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w66t","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809491,"author":"css1971","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w66t","id":"cw6h0","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53544-9a1d6a7e-f0da-4c9e-9921-8322ec6b045a-1566236778"}

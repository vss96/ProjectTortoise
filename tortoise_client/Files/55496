No, that's what you get when you cram hundreds of kids into one building, split them up by age and further by ability or subject, leave them almost entirely without casual friendly contact with adults, and demand they only even interact with each other in break periods. A school is a recipe for cliques, gangs, dog-eat-dog and exclusion.\r\n\r\nA home schooled (more accurately, \"unschooled\") kid interacts with other kids learning the same way, with other people in any clubs they belong to, with parents, with librarians, museum curators, shop staff, adults whose job skills he or she is studying, etc etc. Perhaps their interaction is more biased to adults - school interaction is unnaturally biased to children of the same age, equally confused, from whom nothing can be learned.\r\n\r\nSocial interaction is simply not a flaw of properly done homeschooling.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30687-a366c3e0-4137-4941-b839-edb9c60a18ec-1566236769"}

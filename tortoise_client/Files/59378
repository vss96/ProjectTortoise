She wanted a *bulkhead* seat.  You know, the one with more leg room because the partition is in front of it.  Do you remember?  The seat where noone can put their seat back into her pregnant stomach, effectively wedging her in as if she were a foot in a boot?  That seat.  That's all she wanted.  Just the seat in coach which has a little extra space. \r\n\r\nI had this problem on an international flight whilst traveling with a baby.  They put me in the other bulkhead seat - the bad one - where your seat doesn't recline and the person in front of you smashes their seat into your knees. I could barely even fit my child in to nurse. (Read keep him happy and comfortable.) I asked to be moved. They wouldn't move me.  \r\nEventually - when the little guy absolutely could not be distracted any longer, I wedged him in.  Where he kicked and thumped  the back of the seat. When the flight attendent came to speak with me about it, I just had to say that there *was nothing I could do about it* I knew this would happen and she chose not to move us.  Babies scream loudly when they are hungry. So she needed to choose.\r\n\r\nShe chose to keep us in our seats. The person in front of had to suffer.  I suffered.  The flight attendants suffered.  The little guy was happy - so at least the entire section of the plane didn't suffer.  But, if the airline had been sensitive to our needs, they would have had a lot more happy passengers and employees.  \r\n\r\nBut - they were all \"corporation-y.\"  After all, being compassionate, encouraging repeat customers and trying to create win-win situations is bad for business.","link_id":"t3_unc2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26688-294fc16f-6ff2-4d13-b902-4b7dd8901d17-1566236767"}

Why teach beginner (CS 101) students something not as mainstream as the most prominent languages in use in the world today:\r\n\r\n* Perl\r\n* PHP\r\n* Java\r\n* C# (VB is a thing of the past -- most VBers I know left for C# when it came out in order to say their apps are better and in order to get more cash in the market)\r\n\r\nSorry, but LISP, Python, Ruby, Haskell -- these languages just aren't ready for the mainstream yet.\r\n\r\nI would think that a good starting point would be Perl. Perl is a beautiful language if done properly and if it were not abused by all those Perl one-liner programmers.\r\n\r\nPerl is also a worthwhile skill that even a CS flunky, who simply learned this one language in this first class, could start to use in the marketplace immediately.\r\n\r\nIt's also cross-platform.\r\n\r\nPHP is my favorite language, but I would reason to bet that more CS professors would prefer to introduce students to CS by teaching Perl over PHP for many reasons. Moving from Perl to PHP is not a huge stretch.\r\n\r\nJava is nice, but requires compiling all the time and the declared types get annoying for the budding student. Better to start with something easier.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it. I think all schools around the world should begin to teach CS students with Perl over any other language. Then, introduce them to other languages after that.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to college, they started you on Pascal instead of C, because they said it was a \"teaching language\". Yet Pascal made it seem like working with strings was an afterthought, and was quite annoying. And how many of us prefer curly braces to BEGIN/END blocks? I do. Now you hardly ever hear about Pascal in the universities. Perl could become the new teaching language of choice.\r\n\r\nNow if they could just finish Perl 6 with this new Parrot runtime....","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t3xg","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807447,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"supermike","id":"ct67z","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t3xg","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"213-e35c2828-144a-40f5-94c7-25ed7a3e5ef4-1566236758"}

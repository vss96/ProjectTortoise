Of the gals buying shirts, a whole lot of them get the unisex ones.  Some of them are probably too big for the babydoll tees, but a lot of them just prefer the unisex ones.  In general, people selling t-shirts will put up whatever people want to buy.  If you're complaining stores aren't stocking what you want, tell the store, and they'll figure out there's a demand and sell them.  If they're not listening, it's probably because even though you want it, the demand in general isn't there.\r\n\r\nAll this aside, giving them away at conferences is a different matter, since there's not the same market-y thing going on.  So complaint on a blog is probably a decent approach.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808778,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cv567","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v4hp","author":"xkcd","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34492-8e45d501-3a59-4e0b-a103-83bb37028a03-1566236771"}

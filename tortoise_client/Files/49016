Making a joke out of being well-nigh innumerate (to judge by the examples in the article) lowers expectations across the board. I don't particularly care if people don't know what mathematicians or computer scientists really do but it does bother me if people decide that it's 'not their job' to know how a percentage or power button work.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808758,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cv437","parent_id":"t3_v32h","edited":false,"author":"kamikasei","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33887-720b3b53-5d02-428c-bd15-3e419710a54f-1566236771"}

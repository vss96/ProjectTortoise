{"body":"I always liked the idea that species that lived for only a week perceive time as moving really slowly (compared to our perception of time).  And species that lived for a really long time perceive time as moving faster.  In this way, every living being would have the subjective experience of living roughly the same amount of time (assuming average lifespan).\r\n\r\nOf course, that idea is entirely made up.  While you can test reaction time objectively to get a scale of \"sensory refresh rate\" per species... memory is a much more evasive subject.  Even if a fairly good assessment of memory can be done, how could you possible measure something as subjective as \"how fast time 'feels' like it's moving\"?  Is that more based on short term memory, long term memory, sensory awareness, or physical/mental engagement?\r\n\r\nWhy a crazy-old shark prompted that little spiel, I'm not sure.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u4xm","subreddit":"science","score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1165619431,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"wockyman","id":"cu6gq","parent_id":"t1_cu5nz","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808126,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17265-441de77b-3fce-4c03-bd3a-aeaa5ad56c82-1566236763"}

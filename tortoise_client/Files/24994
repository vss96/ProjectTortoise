I mean, I say hello to the cashier when I step up to the register, or to the bus-driver when I step on the bus. I say thank you when they hand me my change, ticket or receipt. And I don't talk on my damn cellphone while I'm doing it!\r\n\r\nOutright assholes shouldn't be tolerated, but neither should the common jerks either.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808514,"gilded":0,"id":"cur8o","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_upgw","author_flair_text":null,"author":"kungtotte","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27839-b57338a9-4819-4f12-9556-7a6aee7d4b2d-1566236768"}

Both England and Canada seem to have advanced equaly as far as the US has in this area (treating all their citizens like criminals).  \r\n\r\nCombined with constant camera surveillance, data surveillance and financial surveillance, I don't know how anyone can believe we live in a \"free\" country.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that less-advanced countries would have less electronic opportunities to screw their citizens. As technology creep continues, so does the Big Brother mentality of the overbearing police state apparatus. As this article points out, they don't even want to be bothered with Constitutional restraints, such as probable cause and a warrant.\r\n\r\nIs it like that elsewhere?

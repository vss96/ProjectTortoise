That is called drivel.\r\n\r\nWe are having conversation on a website for *free*. All of this is provided to us; use of the servers, use of their bandwidth, their programmers time, etc without charge to us.\r\n\r\nHow is such a thing possible?\r\n\r\nIt is possible because someone (CondeNast?) has figured out how to profit from all of this at no charge to us. These are the things that \"market economies\" can provide. \r\n\r\nIf you are truly unable to see the magic that free-markets can bring, if you are truly unable to feel that natural sense of awe, then I suggest your problem is one of imagination.","retrieved_on":1473809007,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvg5e","id":"cvh6n","author_flair_text":null,"author":"econo","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40591-7cdd82d7-01af-4adb-b25e-97dadd09571e-1566236773"}

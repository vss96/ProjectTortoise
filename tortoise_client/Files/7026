However, many of those texts had been in use significantly before that time.  The reason for the council was because there were so many different versions of the Bible floating around, not it's total absence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, if by by \"hundreds,\" you mean 300, and \"wrote\" you mean compiled via the canonization process, then yes.  Bear in mind that the texts would have needed to have been in use for a while for this problem to present itself at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, to add to your point, the time around which Jesus lived bore a number of \"saviors\" who rose from the masses.  The real bit looked a bit more like *The Life of Brian* than the representation of the time that we tend to see in the media.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vw3w","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166978525,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48622-1c8f17df-6e73-4ff0-8816-c9703d15c3b2-1566236777"}

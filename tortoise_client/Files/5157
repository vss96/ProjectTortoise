It isn't as if we voted to put the very leaders who allowed this happen into office and then paid for the execution with tax dollars or anything.  Now, THAT would be immoral.  \r\n\r\nOh yeah... never mind.  \r\n\r\nSeriously though, the day we start lining up around the block and buying and scalping tickets to executions, I will agree that viewing the execution is immoral.  Otherwise, viewing the execution is merely bearing witness to the acts of a government which allows these things.  And if you're too squeamish for that, then please don't look at or watch these things.  The rest of us would like to know exactly what is being done in our name with our money.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809739,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cwjqs","parent_id":"t1_cwitx","author":"vplatt","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60208-cb9e359e-2028-4181-9684-5e0a2b5c42fb-1566236780"}

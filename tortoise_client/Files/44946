You should probably hope that you either continue to have great returns or have some really forgiving family/friends, because it sounds like what you're engaging in is exactly the kind of dishonesty that securities regulations are meant to prevent.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808984,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvfsa","id":"cvg2m","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40045-413aab0d-b86a-4525-acf7-0a1aaa6f6200-1566236773"}

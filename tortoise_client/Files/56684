It calls you to account for your memory management sins, and eventually pulls you into Pointer Hell. It's an awful kludge painful *#@!$%. This sucks because my primary reason for becoming a programming is/was to program games.\r\n\r\nRuby is the language of the angels. It's beautiful and powerful. On a good day I'm using Ruby.\r\n\r\nC is the language of Atlas, supporting the rest of the world with pure might. If I'm feeling like Atlas, I'll try something in C.\r\n\r\nPython is the language of Prometheus. He wants to give all mankind the light and the power, but for this he is punished by Hades (aka the devil aka the C++ community... I'm mixing mythologies, I know)\r\n\r\nC#, Java, and VB are the languages of Man. Nothing special... they can be used for good or evil. Primarily they are used to get the job done.\r\n\r\nSo, for me: on a good day, Ruby. On an ordinary day, C#. For a hard power job, C. To teach people, Python. When I want to make games... sigh...

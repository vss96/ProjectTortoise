Note that all numbers are in PDF pages.\r\n\r\n&gt;Claim: Our federal deficits alone now total more than 400% of GDP.\r\n\r\n&gt;Fact: The US GDP is around 11 Trillion dollars (google it). Our 2006 budget deficit worked out to 500 billion dollars (pg 42). Our total debt outstanding as a percent of GDP is around 40% (pg 14). He is off by an order of magnitude. I will explain this in more detail later.\r\n\r\nDo you understand the difference between budget deficit and federal deficit? So much for your debunker for the first claim. And I am too bored to read you lengthy post and spend time debunking them all.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vc4j","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-3,"ups":-3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166569867,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39640-f13a5d3c-7ffe-4920-a2f9-fa7f891d5b26-1566236773"}

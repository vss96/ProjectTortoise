I don't own a game console, but if I had to pick I would probably go with the Wii.  Everyone I talked to, young AND old, loves the thing.  The XBox360 would be a second option, especially if I were a \"gamer\".  Here's the problem I see with the PS3: the hardware cost is too much.  The PS3 is suppose to have the better hardware, but I really have to wonder HOW much better it is compared to the 360 and if the difference justifies the cost difference.  Sure, in Japan the PS3 may do great, but the rest of the world will be less xenophobic and will accept the XBox360 over it.","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47527-5d6185f1-ab18-4cbd-bfb9-e7bdfd9d1dc2-1566236775"}

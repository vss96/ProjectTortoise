Think about it, before having the experience, I and I would venture to say most intellectual users of substance, felt exactly as you do now, before the experience. Maybe plenty of drug users are pathetic, I certainly know many who are, but don't paint everyone with the same brush just because they use a substance, instead remember that a genius can experience the mushroom epiphony and broaden his sights likely much more than a truckstop methhead.\r\n\r\nAnyway what's important is that I specifically remember feeling exactly as you do before any mushroom experience. And I, like your use of whatever, essentially tried them due to peer pressure (although I find the term such a cop out). You may tell yourself you aren't missing anything, but you will never know. If, however, you told me you had tried mushrooms, and nothing changed in your life view, even in the least, then you'd have me convinced.\r\n\r\nSo you claim to have experimented with drugs, well what's relevent is what drugs you refer to. All I pose to you is this: if you had happened to try mushrooms instead of the drugs you claim to have tried, you would feel a greater sense of grounding enlightenment, although it would fade with time. You would at least know what we're talking about when we refer to the feeling. It stays with you to know that you saw it once, if that makes any sense, which I imagine it does not, because you haven't had the experience.\r\n\r\nJust don't tell me it's like saying \"it's a black thing\" because your fatal assumption is that being a drug user is a state from birth like being of a certain skin color. This is utter BS considering you yourself tried drugs, as do most Americans, it just depends on who they know and what they do. Kids who do meth and/or heroin are likely to end up in the gutter and kids who smoke pot, well, are likely to do any number of things, but kids who do mushrooms are likely to feel more grounded, and it's as simple as that, look at the study.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167327607,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55185-0d0b323c-28fc-4316-8db5-bd5ec1773bfb-1566236779"}

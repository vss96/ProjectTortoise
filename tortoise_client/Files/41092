Sure, it's bad to do nothing *but* criticize Israel - it'll give everyone a completely out-of-whack perspective.  You seem to think that *all* reddit users hate Israel, and that's the only perspective we have on things?  Wow.  So.  From what I've read here, I think a lot of reddit users hate the US &amp; Bush.  So do all of us US/Bush-hating reddit users have *only* that perspective about these things?  Do we all hate it so much we're gonna go poop on a flag and move to Canada tomorrow?\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with criticism as long as I keep a balanced perspective about that which I am criticizing.  I'm not ignoring the crimes of the rest of the world - I can't help but hear about them.  I do not hold Israel responsible for everything bad in the Middle East.  That would be silly.  No one group is responsible for anything, ever.  The world is more complicated than that, and I know that.\r\n\r\nReddit is set up so that there is no possible way only one side of anything would get documented.  Post some stuff.  Anyone can do it.  Admittedly, birds of a feather... but I do see truly oppositional viewpoints on reddit all the time.    \r\n\r\nI love reddit - it's this commenting thing that makes it so wonderful.  We can have very in-depth conversations/debates with very very different people.  And as long as people like you stick around, we won't get all out-of-whack in our perspectives.

I found it in my neighbor's yard in Atlanta and kept it for about 3 years.  It grew from about 1.5 inches to about 4 inches long, in a 10 gallon aquarium.  I kept the aquarium half full of water and there were rocks and a shelf for it to climb onto to get out of the water.  But it was in the water almost constantly.\r\n\r\nThe musk turtle looks kind of like a snapping turtle except its shell is smooth.  I never found out if my turtle was a male or female, although I called it a 'he'.  I kept fish in the aquarium, too.  'He' would eat a fish occasionally, about every other day, so I was always buying more.  It kept things interesting. :)\r\n\r\nFinally, I had to move and couldn't take the turtle with me.  I gave it to a neighbor.  More than a year later, I went back there and talked to the neighbor.  They said they had kept the turtle for a few months and then released it in the pond behind their house.  They marked its shell with nail polish to be able to identify it later.  The last time they saw it was about six months later, and it had grown to about a foot long!\r\n\r\nI think it's great that turtles regulate their own growth to fit with their environment.  Humans seem to always expand and consume as much as possible, without any restraint.  If only people could learn and internalize the lessons that turtles have in their genes.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uibm","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808454,"distinguished":null,"author":"mleonhard","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cunyh","parent_id":"t1_cum2h","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26415-88da8c23-7b37-40e9-bc37-046ac370245f-1566236767"}

I only ever had one multiple choice exam and the class streaming/sets (absent from the business studies class mentioned above) meant, at least in the top set, we were taught with minimal disturbance.\r\n\r\nFrom an education point of view Europe does compulsary schooling better and Universities in the US are far superior. Only Oxford and Cambridge can break their domination of the top 10.\r\n\r\nHow long ago did you go? I'm 27 so I left comprehensive 11 years ago, it may have been different before or after I was at school though.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808604,"gilded":0,"id":"cuw27","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuw0d","author":"naughty","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30190-1240a059-34aa-420c-a416-dfb333fb294c-1566236769"}

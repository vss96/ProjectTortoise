It's still a proprietary system, just like OS/2, the Mac, or the Amiga. Non-proprietary refers to standards and platforms anyone can create, not ones anyone can build apps for. \r\n\r\nAnyone can create a POSIX compatible Linux distribution, but its nearly impossible to create a working copy of Windows or its libraries, including DirectX. WINE and similar projects try, but after 10 years, its all still in beta.\r\n\r\nIt would be easier to copy Mac OS X than copy Windows. Both, however, are still proprietary.\r\n\r\nThe point you have the most trouble with is understanding that DirectX is the technology MS uses to tie the gaming industry to Windows. If it supported OpenGL, it would have to compete on its own merits, rather than hiding behind its monopoly.\r\n\r\nBut screw facts, you are an MS fan! Mod a story down because you are  uninformed and ignorant, and because you like playing the freaking xbox. \r\n\r\nReddit can go the way of Digg.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1167602269,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60839-8377fce7-5596-4c78-b288-7b93e642af50-1566236780"}

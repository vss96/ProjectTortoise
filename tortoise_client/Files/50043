I mean, it's not as if we don't have a whole load of different particles with different couplings to different fields already.  What's so bad about having a particle that only couples to the weak and gravitational field?\r\n\r\nHave a look at [Bekenstein's paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0509519): TeVeS evolved through a whole series of kludges.\r\n\r\nFirst you multiply the metric by a scalar (&amp;Phi;) to get AQUAL, but that doesn't work because it doesn't change the Weyl components of the metric hence doesn't explain photon lensing.\r\n\r\nSo you add another component derived from a constant vector field to fix the photon lensing, but that introduces non covariance.\r\n\r\nSo you introduce a dynamical vector field which has its own (rather ugly) evolution equation (3.2) and using that you get the real spacetime metric via another (rather ugly) equation (3.1).\r\n\r\nBut remember you can still modify the scalar factor mentioned above, so lets introduce yet another (rather ugly) dynamical equation for &amp;Phi;.\r\n\r\nIf all this is not a kludge, I don't know what is.  Of course it might turn out to be right (stranger things have happened), but it's still a blatant kludge.","link_id":"t3_urqc","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808547,"distinguished":null,"author":"acrophobia","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_curzd","id":"cusyo","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28672-f10b20f0-abdd-4592-b31f-16e5afa886c1-1566236768"}

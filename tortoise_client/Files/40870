I suppose they think cops have never and will never plant evidence, lie on a witness stand or coerce witnesses. It happens.

Those who knowingly break the law in order to act out their sociopathic, sadistic  urges. You do not believe in our criminal justice system which has determined that convicted criminals be deprived of freedom -- *not* tortured physically or mentally -- this, so emphatically that there are laws *against* it.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to be personal when I say that anyone who condones torture of another human being is in need of psychiatric treatment -- and never, never think it cannot happen to you.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808238,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cucgl","parent_id":"t1_cucc7","author_flair_text":null,"author":"DA5lD","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20504-0c559deb-6892-49b3-9229-984ae940264f-1566236765"}

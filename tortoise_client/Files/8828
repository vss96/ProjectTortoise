I think Haskell is interesting, but the example he chose to show its \"superiority\" is bad. Why doesn't he use the available syntax in the Lisp example? If you know how an \"if\" works in Lisp it is just like the Python version. Both short and precise.\r\n\r\nHe concludes that the Haskell version isn't \"verbose or full of special cases\", but what is pattern matching if not that. For every special case you have to write a pattern (fib 0 = 0|fib 1 = 1).\r\n\r\nYeah, Haskell is interesting and pattern matching can be a great tool, but the black or white position in that article is a poor argument.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uqo3","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166089216,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":21,"ups":21,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27722-c135413e-58dd-49b7-a954-81e4c7c80931-1566236768"}

Circumcision provides an advantage if it creates a bottleneck for HIV transmission, and it simply doesn't do that in the West.\r\n\r\n* In the West, other factors are much more important - the US has a much higher AIDS rate than Canada or Europe, yet has a 70% circumcision rate, as opposed to very low % for Europe.\r\n\r\nI worry that Western quacks will apply these results, which relate to very specific populations, to the USA and Europe. The science is good, but its likely applications are not. So far the media have been good about writing that this benefit applies to places where female-to-make heterosexual transmission is important, but they better start explaining why these places are special.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166065767,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"science","id":"cuq1m","parent_id":"t3_uors","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"anonymous-coward","retrieved_on":1473808493,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27344-3049d99a-1263-4a45-8b4b-5fa23aae801b-1566236768"}

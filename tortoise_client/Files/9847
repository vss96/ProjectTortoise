I've submitted articles that I thought were good but deleted them because downmods keep bringing down my karma. I don't know what importance karma has exactly but with 200+ karma, my links still get treated like newbies and at this rate, I'll never really get to 5000 to get any special high-karma benefit if it exists.\r\n\r\nWhy isn't my comment score counted in my karma? And then use karma to base the effect up/down mods have on a link. If you have a high karma and the only people that keep downvoting you are ones with karma &lt; 10, then your link should still be on the new page for a while.\r\n\r\nGood participation/commenting will help more users get higher karma and recognition. That way it becomes possible for new comers to get their articles posted after a while as long as they prove they're not spammers and engage in meaningful conversation.\r\n\r\nRight now, I'm scared to submit any new links because I'm afraid of losing the few karma points I have.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w72o","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809562,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"chime","id":"cwa8v","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw8yx","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55452-d58cc83b-94a2-41fa-845c-3193df41b9d4-1566236779"}

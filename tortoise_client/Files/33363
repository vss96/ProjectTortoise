Both sides in WWII thought that it was God's will that they would win the war. Obviously nobody ever knows, but that doesn't stop people from prognosticating.\r\n\r\nYes, the Church has used its considerable influence to push its view. Do I think it's appropriate? Not really. Why am I defending it? Because the view comes out of an earnest will to do the right thing, even if that doesn't agree with what we think the right thing to do is. Old issues like \"indulgences\" were not only misguided, they came out of a more selfish nature. If you really see the Church as saying \"oh look, uneducated people we can take advantage of!\", then I'd say to try and be a bit more objective. ;) As far as keeping knowledge from people goes, this is more akin to a journalist protecting their sources because they believe in the principal of the thing, and staying true to that principal is a valuable thing in itself. I defend the Church because they have stayed true to their principles, even if I don't think that the action is completely right. It's just not the \"crime\" it's been made out to be.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166321024,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33173-178aac9b-1986-4131-84d5-1cc8a686fb71-1566236770"}

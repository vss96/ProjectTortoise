{"controversiality":0,"body":"I'm French, and even though it is true that kids have lots of holiday breaks, it isn't the case for most people. Many parents put their kids in holiday camps or keep them at home during holidays, while they are still at work.

So when you read *January: Hangovers, detox and post-prandial guilt consume the first three weeks of January. Serious production can start again around the 21st.*, please remember that this is a satire and really quite far from reality.  \r\nOther than that, yes, we *do* have 35 hours weeks and they are quite common now :)","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u4ag","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165599832,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"author":"thamer","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu54h","parent_id":"t3_u4ag","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808098,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16460-36c737fb-e735-4074-b7cf-33cdfc3b9be8-1566236763"}

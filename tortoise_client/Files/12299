I mean EVERYONE does it. Think about it - if everyone does some task, then it is a very obvious thought try to AUTOMATE that task. With coding blocks or branching with whitespace - there's no way to automate indentation.\r\n\r\nThis is a poor criticism.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, you must put braces around blocks in C. Unless you're coding in an editor that doesn't have a python mode the editor **indents for you**.\r\n\r\nIn Komodo, for example, any new line starts at the correct indentation for that block. It doesn't matter if you jump around or not, it'll always go to the right indentation unless you need to unindent to an outer block, in which case it's one backspace per level.\r\n\r\n&gt;With lisp no mater what i do with code - automatic indentation is 1 shortcut away. With python - indentation is necessary chore.\r\n\r\nI've probably written a few hundred thousand lines of python by now, and can count the number of times I've had to manually indent on one hand.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uhgd","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23502-58f1947c-d767-4bd2-8e34-005c33148ef3-1566236766"}

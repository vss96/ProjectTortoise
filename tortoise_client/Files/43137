Man, I love my apt. Finding and downloading applications for Windows is a crap-shoot in almost every way. I find this especially handy when building new systems: it takes far longer to build, update, and add needed applications on a Windows system than on most Linux systems.\r\n\r\nCraziness.  My own personal experience, 9 times out of 10 installing applictions is much easier on Windows.  Downloading a setup program and running it is really nice- something I wish Linux devs would implement (autopackage is nice; no one seems to use it though).\r\n\r\nMost times, I end up searching for a piece of software, finding one that does what I want it do, and then instead of downloading it and installing it from the same page (ala windows), I have to go check synaptic, most times update repositories, often add the package files by hand and then hope it works.  \r\n\r\nFor certain pieces of software package managers work really well.  But not for everyting.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_wifs","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60217-570e683d-5be9-46a0-86b7-edacf8b10827-1566236780"}

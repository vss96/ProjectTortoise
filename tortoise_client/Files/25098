For example, if a company normally generates $100M revenue (denominated in euros) on $90M in costs (denominated in dollars), their earnings are $10M.  If the dollar falls 10% against the euro, so that that $100M of euros is now worth $110M in dollars, then their profit has just gone up to $20M.  Since stock prices normally track earnings, you'd expect their stock price to double, which makes it worth 180% of its previous value after accounting for dollar depreciation.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wa0e","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55563-a6ccc7bd-62e9-4fac-9601-bf5e35c6ae0e-1566236779"}

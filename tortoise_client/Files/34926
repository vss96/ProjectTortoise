Teenagers want to try what is illegal because they're teenagers. As for adults, I'm sure that if pot were legal there are plenty of adults who would go to alcohol bars less frequently if they could go to a marijuana bar instead. I think lots of adults don't smoke it at all or very infrequently just because it's not at all socially acceptable right now. In the future, you may be talking about how stoned you were friday around the water cooler in the office while passing judgement on another guy for puking his brains out at the local bar.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v81w","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1166490591,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37250-f4ba33f7-ce8f-4f25-a1c4-1835cea8e70e-1566236772"}

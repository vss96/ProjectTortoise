{"controversiality":0,"body":"Do you refute that the premise of my original comment was that a religion is not simply what is stated in its texts?  That certainly is what I was trying to argue.  So I am (was) saying that a religions beliefs are not exactly those that are written in the text.  From that premise my rhetorical question logically follows.  Both statements are of the form \"this religious group is not to be taken seriously because they do not follow certain beliefs that are not actually part of their religion.\"\r\n\r\nI think you can argue against my premise; there is certainly a lot of room in there to argue.  Or you could argue that I did not actually communicate that premise; I am not the most gifted communicator.  However, I strongly believe that my conclusionary comment has no logical flaw in it as it falls from the premise argument.

There are plenty (an infinite number, in fact) of real-number ratios, and they can be computed and compared without issue. Whether those comparisons *mean* anything or not is a separate issue from the question of what a ratio *is*.\r\n\r\n&gt;...you seem to agree that infinity should not come up in a good theory...\r\n\r\nSay what?\r\n\r\nThe Dawkins piece pointed out that the difference between two measurements of the age of the Earth were *hugely* different.\r\n\r\nMany commenters said, \"Eh, yeah, but that doesn't matter -- measurements are frequently off by that much.\"\r\n\r\nSo I asked \"Oh yeah? Off by *that* much? When? *How* frequently?\"\r\n\r\nYou haven't answered that question. You have pointed out that some people believe in Hawaii, but you tried to drive there once, and it didn't work out too well.

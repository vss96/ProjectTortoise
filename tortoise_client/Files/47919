{"controversiality":0,"body":"At 21x12x3cm and at a hefty 1.5lbs (2100), we are most definitely NOT talking about \"small device\" wonder. Stuffing all the latest technology into a product is done all the time, but while these make for seemingly impressive demos, they are all commercial flops.\r\n\r\nDesigning something that works the way its supposed to and meets people's needs is much harder. This is the reason they call it a \"Crackberry\" while the Newton is a failure and gets lampooned (\"Hey Dolph, take a note on your Newton: 'Beat up Martin'. 'Eat Up Martha').\r\n\r\nAnd I'm sure the Newton can be hacked to do those things, much like the TCP/IP protocol can be hacked to carry traffic via carrier pigeons, what I was instead referring to is things it can do easily, out of the box.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u0qi","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":1,"score":1,"created_utc":1165792025,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"martythemaniak","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cucl9","id":"cud9u","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808254,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20983-3993fd44-bfd6-4a1e-8963-26f84ee4f73f-1566236765"}

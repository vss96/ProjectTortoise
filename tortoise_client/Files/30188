The Haredim are the Wahabi of Judaism: if you don't behave as they like, they attack you.  They've attacked men and women alike for driving on Shabbat.  They've attacked people for being too drunk.  They've attacked the buses discussed in TFA for *not* sex-segregating.\r\n\r\nWhich brings a small tangent: the bus driver probably didn't get involved because he didn't want to get beat up by Haredim himself.\r\n\r\nPoint is, Israel *is* more western and progressive than the Arab countries.  If the Uber-Orthodox in Brooklyn could get away with this kind of thing, they'd probably attack women sitting in \"men's\" seats on *their* sex-segregated buses.\r\n\r\nHaredim are the extreme fringe of Hasidic Judaism, who are already more religious than the Modern Orthodox (the majority of Orthodox Jews).  You can't treat them as representative of either Judaism or Israel.","link_id":"t3_vat3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38582-7c6b4daf-dd44-42bc-9792-9bef2f4c3345-1566236773"}

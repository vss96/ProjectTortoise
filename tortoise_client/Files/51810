{"body":"&gt; More interesting to me is the theory that the widespread practice of slavery in Greece and Rome would have prevented people from trying to create machines that could perform human labor.\r\n\r\nWhy do people assume slavery is cheap? Slave owners don't pay wages, but they do have significant labor costs: shelter, food, clothing, medical, etc. Don't forget the high capital expenditure in purchasing slaves too.\r\n\r\nEven today when this horrible practice is mostly gone and even with the use of much cheaper free (i.e., libre) labor, firms are very interested in reducing their labor costs with machines and automation.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ttlc","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165438213,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"gbacon","id":"ctvxk","parent_id":"t3_ttlc","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807928,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12337-45f0d634-c651-4529-b209-4560f9307671-1566236761"}

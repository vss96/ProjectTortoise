Hair-trigger fingers have nothing to do with it - it is that CNN's reporting is of such a poor quality overall that people cannot tell when you make an outlandishly stupid observation, such that Barack Obama's clothes affect his political leanings toward radical Islam, it gets muddled in with the poor work you've done on reporting \"both sides\" of Kerry's war record, Al Gore's earth tones or Internet deal - you've done such a bad job of reporting the news that we can't tell when you're doing a bad job of reporting the news on purpose.\r\n\r\nGreenfield's \"explanation\" doesn't excuse his actions; the problem is not with the Blogosphere.

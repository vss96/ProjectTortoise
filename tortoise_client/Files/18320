They can be somewhat excused for this: funding for working physicists often comes from grants, and grants are more plentiful when the general population thinks that science is really cool.  But one shouldn't assume that just because he's read a few pop-science books on quantum mechanics, he knows the subject.  Most of RK's criticism comes from not actually knowing what he's talking about.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809133,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvnln","id":"cvnnv","author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43776-e645644a-ed9a-4707-9b99-e89380967380-1566236774"}

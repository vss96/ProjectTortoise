They always start out clean, keep it together for awhile, and then get ugly as more and more gets added.  Examples: Java SE, .NET framework.  They both have good things about them, and horrible mismash things about them.\r\n\r\nI'd rather have a fugly stdlib with lots of options and good tools than a clean one missing a lot of what I need.  I don't know about 'quopri' because I guess I never needed it bad enough :)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't want to see the whole thing refactored, that would break too much.  Add slowly and deprecate over time, perhaps.  For example, how the 'subprocess' module took over ugly functions from the 'os' module.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55175-eb111c22-ef41-41a9-b3e3-ccb468ee9158-1566236779"}

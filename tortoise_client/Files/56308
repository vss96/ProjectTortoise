Perhaps it was very involved and lude. Everyone here is so anxious to jump on the persecution of the airlines bandwagon just because its gay people. If I was making out heavily with my girlfriend, and a stewardess told me I was making old ladies uncomfortable, would I get an article in the paper too? NO. Gays want to be treated equally, well abuse on airplanes happens to everyone. Your rights are restricted for the 8 hours or whatever that you are on the plane. Everyones rights are. No one here was there and knows exactly what went on and people should stop blindly supporting these people just because they are gay.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me, it just seems like some yuppies creating a scene so that they have something to talk to their friends over dinner about. If you havent been some how abused on a plane, consdier yourself lucky.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t6wc","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1487-49e0426a-2155-47ae-aaf9-d1043dcafbd3-1566236758"}

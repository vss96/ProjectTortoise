I'm assuming that that wasn't sarcasm.\r\n\r\nSo you say MS does everything they can for us.\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nSo here are  a few questions for you...\r\n\r\n1) why do you use spyware. That's for you, not for us. \r\n\r\n2) why do you release beta, or should I say alpha-, class products that are ripe for viruses, spyware, adware, and so on.\r\n\r\n3) why did you use highly illegal techniques such as violation of partnership agreements, multiple versions of frameworks (published and unpublished) and so on, to guarantee your products 'won' and could be sold at premum prices?\r\n\r\n4) why does MS misleadingly claim to be a technology leader. Please name one technology led by MS. Please don't include companies bought AFTER they developed something.\r\n\r\nYour software isn't excellent, and all you do for the customer is ask us to pay high prices for mediocre software. Not that other companies don't do that too, but still, 'excellent software and all the things we do for YOU the customer', uh, thanks, I guess.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473809649,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cwei7","edited":false,"id":"cwex0","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Random","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57880-76f04190-4706-4ebe-9f26-2aad65394245-1566236780"}

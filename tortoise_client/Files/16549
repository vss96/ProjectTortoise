{"body":"&gt;But the biggest irony of all is that the real boom -- the one in the 1990s -- followed tax changes that were the reverse of Bush's policies. Clinton raised taxes on the rich, and the economy prospered.\r\n\r\nUhm, I was there, I'm pretty sure that the 'real boom' was caused by the creation of a new industry that hit its stride in the 80s and 90s, personal and business computers and software, and the internet boom in the mid/late 90s.  In those rare times when technological advance leads to the genesis of whole new industries (auto, radio, tv, being other good examples), there's always a boom, regardless of the government's tax policies.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_unoz","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166048977,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"fbg111","edited":false,"id":"cup9b","parent_id":"t3_unoz","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808478,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26954-14c0330d-771b-4d99-b282-1ce5a7e54135-1566236768"}

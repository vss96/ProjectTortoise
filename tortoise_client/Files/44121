If this is true, then there is nothing present in religion that isn't present in mankind, and it's not religion producing the evil, mankind is. As Voltaire said, \"if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him\", and if religion didn't exist, we'd still find ways to exercise the evils within human nature. The argument that religion is the source for this evil caves in on itself if you believe that mankind is the source for religion.\r\n\r\nedit: in addition, with regards to your comment regarding stoning. the death penalty is still in effect today in secular societies. Most technologically advanced countries have moved on to the electric chair, firing squad, or lethal injection, but none of those are devised to be painless or \"humane\".\r\n\r\nthe point i've been trying to make in this thread, and the argument i've been having with you in various spots, centers around the fact that the Torah is a religious guide, a cultural guide, and a legal code. Those legal codes are no longer relevant and have been supplanted, but are still cited by atheists, primarily atheists who aren't open to both sides. Judaism has grown up as both a religion and a culture, but too often people who haven't looked into it put everything in the same boat.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vat3","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166552615,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38871-8eb498a7-e1a9-49ec-bee6-eb4d4b80c8bb-1566236773"}

{"body":"Python and Ruby are imperative languages with some functional features. For example, Python supports lambdas, but only one-line lambdas (which limits their usefulness). It has good support for list processing (which is more of a functional style of programming), but still not as much as Lisp.\r\n\r\nThe problem with classifying a language as either functional or imperative is that, in practice, there isn't *one* feature that defines a language as functional or imperative. \r\n\r\nAnd sometimes it depends on the style the language is used in, too. Common Lisp can be written functionaly or imperatively (or both at the same time).\r\n\r\nJeff P.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_u3p2","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","ups":7,"score":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165616466,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"webnrrd2k","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu5uk","id":"cu6bb","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808123,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17160-d2adeedf-b627-431c-a5db-8c694ca7cf51-1566236763"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"AFAIK, the copyright owner can change the license, but any code legally distributed under the GPL stays that way. So if you one day wake up and want to start making money off your GPLed project you can change the license to it, but anyone who already has the code - which is most likely everyone that has the software - can freely reuse that code in their own GPLed project.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to distribute your code under multiple licenses. The copyright holder on a GPLed project could also sell commercial licenses for the same codebase (MySQL does this, for example). If I understand it correctly there is no solid *legal* reason that MS would not be able to include these tools. I'd say it is more a misunderstanding of/hostility towards open source software.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ud35","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1165809545,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"author":"senzei","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cue1w","parent_id":"t1_cudsh","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808268,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21455-79af2120-49d2-43c4-882c-d6273674591d-1566236765"}

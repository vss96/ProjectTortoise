Granted, it's been years since I needed it the last time. Despite all the bloat/trivia aspect, it came in handy. No feature in any language is there \"just because\". Somebody needed it. I am glad placement new got in.\r\n\r\nI do despise integral conversions, too, and the use of integral instead of a real \"boolean\" type for logic (but this is C's problem, not C++'s). It's a right place to break C compatibility for me.\r\n\r\n&gt;C++ references and references in other languages are not exactly the same.\r\n\r\nC++ actually has a natural concept of references, contrary to many other languages. Java and C have pass by value only. C#/.NET have \"ref\" etc, but there are no references for class types. Object Pascal requires exact type match when passing a reference, which is ugly (I may be wrong here)...\r\n\r\nYour complaint about smart pointers is beside the point. They are a technique, not in a language itself.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166508272,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t1_cvb6l","id":"cvbho","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Gotebe","retrieved_on":1473808897,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37678-67d2d743-7460-4a03-b792-1dc6158e3d03-1566236772"}

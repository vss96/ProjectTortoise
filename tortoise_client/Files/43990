You can even actively reduce your risk without much effort.\r\n\r\nYou should be alert at all times when cars are nearby. Twice as alert as if you were driving. Mostly this consists of riding around for a while and developing the ability to place the distance and rough size of cars coming up behind you by ear (it only takes a couple of months to develop this). If a driver isn't paying attention to you and you are forced to ditch remember three things:\r\n\r\n1. You are far more agile than a car\r\n2. You can stop much more quickly than a car\r\n3. You are significantly smaller than a car\r\n\r\nIt's not terribly difficult to develop good accident avoidance skills.\r\n\r\nAfter being alert comes proper road choice. See if your state DOT (if in the US) has a bicycle map, and use google maps to scout out roads that look safe to bike on (if you own a car you can even run through them quickly). I find that it isn't that hard to find routes that have low traffic or have nice wide shoulders once I see a larger picture of the area. Residential streets are good for this.\r\n\r\nI've been bicycling as my only form of transport since August, and after a few weeks of gaining strength and regaining balance I found myself able to navigate traffic without many problems.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165012699,"score":7,"ups":7,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_ct91o","id":"ctaev","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"unknown_lamer","retrieved_on":1473807524,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2326-3cb0ee00-5ec6-4b07-a00c-8c1def780afd-1566236758"}

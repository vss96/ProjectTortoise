It's this kind of fear of these rare homicidal drivers that somehow bullies all the other drivers and I refuse to be a pussy about it.   Now, I'd never purposely cause an accident as I never actually want to hurt anyone, but I'm not gonna let some uncivil asshole get the better of me.  I refuse to encourage this kind of behavior by speeding up.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not even that I drive slow. I go 10 over most of the  time, and 20 over on highways.  And, of course, I speed back up once I can actually see the whole of their headlights.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808123,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cu6bx","parent_id":"t1_cu65j","edited":false,"author":"flyhighplato","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17172-f0ae2fa4-e197-4a2c-bfd2-7ae1fb31b5c1-1566236763"}

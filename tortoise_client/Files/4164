Multiple inheritance? You might abuse it... chop.\"\r\n\"Now, this is music to the ears of Enterprise software, who is willing to throw umpteen bajillions of programmers at simple problems\"\r\n\r\nTrue, true and more true.  But, what about simple and KISS?  They took that model and batted it out of the park, now they have millions of developers.  Is it because they need millions of developers to solve the problems or is it just because it is a language that you can work with regardless of your skillset and still produce some kind of software.\r\n\r\nOn the features of multiple inheritance and operator overloading, etc.  Some would argue you could use interface inheritance.  Plus, they say you should favor composition over inhertance anyway.  On operator overloading, there is no real java feature support here; but maybe it was abused in C++ or not used. \r\n\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_utqb","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808564,"distinguished":null,"author":"berlinbrown","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cutv1","edited":false,"id":"cutw5","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29174-dbfd0f8b-9b40-4197-9b42-e7df60e373b1-1566236769"}

I realize most people code java apps for \"write once, debug everywhere\" but a lot more people are *more comfortable* coding in Java (and calling Cocoa where needed) than writing their program in straight up Obj-C. \r\n\r\nI suppose that will change with Obj-C 3.0, which features garbage collection, but I'd still prefer they kept that option open, if they're going to open up the cocoa api. I can see a great \"How to Write Mac Apps with Java\" enticing a lot more developers. That way, they don't need to learn python or ruby or objective-c. They can use the language they were taught in college (and feel comfortable with) and then, after learning cocoa, transition to a more 'hip' programming language.","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473808495,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_upa5","id":"cuq6d","author":"redrobot5050","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27410-40985b8a-dc58-47a1-862b-31acbacb28a0-1566236768"}

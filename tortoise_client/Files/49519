Consumerism involves manufactured desire to separate you and your money, as opposed to being a path toward something meaningful, a stairmaster as opposed to a path up a mountain. There's no reward in the end, just a longing for ever more possessions beyond your already accumulated stuff and debt.\r\n\r\nTo quote from \"Wanderer\":\r\n\r\n\"What does a man need—-really need? A few pounds of food each day, heat and shelter, six feet to lie down in--and some form of working activity that will yield a sense of accomplishment. That's all-—in the material sense. And we know it. But we are brainwashed by our economic system until we end up in a tomb beneath a pyramid of time payments, mortgages, preposterous gadgetry, playthings that divert our attention from the sheer idiocy of the charade. The years thunder by. The dreams of youth grow dim where they lie caked in dust on the shelves of patience. Before we know it, the tomb is sealed. Where then lies the answer? In choice. Which shall it be, bankruptcy of purse of bankrutpcy of life?\" \r\n","controversiality":0,"ups":12,"score":12,"created_utc":1165669462,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u6tj","id":"cu8bn","author":"Stubb","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808161,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18317-d9e940cd-235e-4ff1-a06d-e744e4b79198-1566236764"}

Its nice to dream, but my original post was asking if anyone believed this, you obviously do since you're trying to claim there is actual science and reality behind this dream.\r\n\r\n&gt; Wah??? What like most of the trains in europe and japan, or american cities? Or any ordinary elevator?\r\n\r\nYou're trying to equate the realities of space travel to a walk down to the corner store. Thats the problem with the whole theory, you think that because something works in your everyday life, that it will scale up to an unlimited level. However just because you have a stairway to your second floor in your house, doesn't mean you can build a stairway to the moon.\r\n\r\n&gt; Once such a material is available, the economics of the elevator are so superior to any other space access technology that even the enormous political and finanicial logistics of such a project can be readily overcome.\r\n\r\nI can dream too, how about this simply replacing modern air travel as well! we just speed someone up the teher and then back down a seperate tether to another spot on earth! according to everything printed in the wikipedia link you gave. Read a few of the articles that the wikipedia links to and you'll see they even dispute this as science fiction.\r\n\r\nset phasers on stun!","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vz0r","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51245-c44b1b4d-68aa-4564-adc8-eb7429cd7fce-1566236778"}

I'm only 23.  When I was in middle school compared to today, the rules of acceptable clothing (and not just at 'talent shows', but just day-to-day wear) have changed so drastically it's unbelievable.  I can't imagine having a daughter and letting her dress like girls do today...and it's not like it's girls from bad homes / neighborhoods or who hang out with the 'wrong sort of people'.  The worst offenders are upper-middle-class.  It's borderline *sick* what parents let their kids dress like anymore.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wdrb","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57552-1912e05f-ae6f-46fe-be54-b99effd72ac0-1566236779"}

After people become used to seeing these hydraulic poles at every traffic stop, people are just going to start becoming more careful when driving. These poles dont have to be made of hard metal. They could also be made of hard plastic so that in case a crazy driver does want to go through it inflicts minimal damage on the vehicle(bumper cracks?). I feel that theyre better than having nothing. Ive seen two incidents of people getting run over by cars at traffic lights and thats why I feel strongly about this.","link_id":"t3_tvb1","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808038,"distinguished":null,"author":"baadshah","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu1ue","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu1fj","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14877-1ab1808b-954b-4cec-9594-4e3f7e9869f6-1566236762"}

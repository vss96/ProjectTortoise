{"controversiality":0,"body":"Prove it.  The government alleged case of \"terrorist\" on 9/11 has never been proven. The so-called connection to Bin Laden has also never been proven.\r\n\r\nThe doctored videos however, are indicative of a very evil and corrupt governement that will demonize whosever it will to accmplish it's agenda.\r\n\r\nOh, I misread you comment... You said *since* 9/11.  Well, **prove that** too.  What terrorist?  You call those fighting in Iraq to overthrow the US invasion terrorists?  Would you not do the same if another nation invaded the US?\r\n\r\nA father who has his family blown to bits that takes up arms against US soldiers is **not** a terrorist. Only yesterday, I read that 2-3% of the fighting in Iraq was because of Al Queda. And I've read a lot of conflicting information that Al Queda is a US initiated operation.  Go figure. Hegellian Dialect?  I don't know, but I can't in good faith call those who are fighting for their homeland to be terrorists.\r\n\r\nThe real terrorist live in America.  Most of the world knows this now.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tifp","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165247447,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lifeofliberty","parent_id":"t1_ctjgo","edited":false,"id":"ctkbt","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807712,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6731-147c0527-85b6-46b5-9583-14a4ad5b2550-1566236760"}

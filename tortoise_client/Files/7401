Here's some slightly more useful info for developers.\r\n\r\nAlthough the CEO and the CIO look like complete morons - take into account that they are smart enough to earn in a week what you earn in a year. They have focused stupidity. They don't believe what you SAY, because they don't understand it. They believe what they SEE, provided when they are ask some questions you have the answers ready.\r\n\r\nIf you have a project that is 90% underlying guts then no manner of UI trickery as outlined in the article is going to work. You can sketch naff icons all you want, if they see it takes you four weeks to go from one sketch icon to one real icon they are going to think you're taking the piss (and you are).\r\n\r\nInstead, focus on what they really care about, and what they are good at - the 'benefits led' reasons why the project is being done in the first place. Have a phased evolutionary delivery, have a 'pilot team' of real users who gradually get to try out and use the increasing functionality. Then you can report real tangible benefits to the CEO. \r\n\r\n\"The pilot group is now 9% more efficient with the project 32% complete. We estimate at completion and rolled out across the company we will generate 25% efficiency improvements - a ROI of 26.2\". Make sure you can blame any failure at full rollout on local managers intransigence and you are home free.\r\n\r\nRemember, software projects are NOT about software - they are about benefits to the company/user.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8ho","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809537,"author":"dude78","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw8x4","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w8ho","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54816-ab509bdd-305e-440c-a81a-8c5e5a9608a6-1566236779"}

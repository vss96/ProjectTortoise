The wii has many more interesting titles in its lineup that show off the wiimote in much more interesting ways. I'm talking \"Rayman\", \"Super Monkey Ball\", \"Trauma Center\", \"Super Swing Golf\" and \"Excite Truck\" which you already mentioned. Don't get too hung up on Zelda just because every gaming site keeps hyping the game. The Wii has great lineup titles beyond the Zelda franchise.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809457,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw3sr","id":"cw4po","author":"grzelakc","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52613-e485d907-fa55-4655-8ea6-90e394a35883-1566236778"}

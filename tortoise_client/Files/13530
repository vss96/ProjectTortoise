{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt;It is possible to thrive in the IT industry with limited or out-of-date technical skills, but it's more difficult. During a bust, middle-managers and project managers are often the first to go. Those with up-to-date technical skills can also struggle, but not to the same extent. It's possible to build and maintain IT systems without management skills, but not without technical skills.\r\n\r\nHah...hahaha...\r\n\r\nYou're the first to get fired if you don't have management skills.  An IT guy that's a people person but on ok at technical can survive a lot longer than the asshole who knows everything.  The guy with management skills ends up running the show and telling the smart-asses that think they know everything what to do.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying you can be your standard pointy haired boss and survive, but you only need to know how things work on a theoretical level once you're an IT manager.  You don't have time for anything else when you're busy fending off the accountants and sales people from destroying everything.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ttri","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":1,"score":1,"created_utc":1165434204,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"PhilK","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctvlv","parent_id":"t3_ttri","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807922,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12164-4dbb3680-5504-4adb-8053-fb57c1023691-1566236761"}

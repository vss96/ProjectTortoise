There are many, many sociological reasons for this: people are more likely to rate products that they like than those they don't like, and people feel guilty about writing bad reviews (remember how your mom told you \"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all\"... that's ingrained in many people's minds, not that that's altogether a bad thing). People also don't really deeply understand how ratings systems work: When you're in school, 69% is generally a FAILURE, but that = 3.5 stars on a 5 star scale. 4 out 5 stars would, in the school system, barely be above a C grade.\r\n\r\nI could go on (and in fact I did, I have a whole chapter about this in my book on film criticism)... but I'd love to hear some other thoughts on the topic.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165199190,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5774-37b9fd71-a3b7-4534-bc67-3320433773c2-1566236759"}

An eye for an eye and all that is well and good in primitive societies, but I had hoped that we had developed beyond that stage. It would be much better if we found a way of teaching them a better way to live.\r\n\r\nI realize that this is impossible today. But perhaps we'll get there one day. My heart cringes whenever someone lives 20+ years in prison without actually getting any benefit from it (i.e. going back to the same old criminal life). Never mind what they actually did; most of them are human and had their reasons for acting the way they did. And those who were mentally sick at the time don't belong in prison at all. They belong in a hospital.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165404865,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_trhc","id":"cttll","author_flair_text":null,"author":"marvin","retrieved_on":1473807885,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11248-a5694198-19fa-4533-b10c-a7f650a3051f-1566236761"}

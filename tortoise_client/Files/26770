An LED five times as efficient would convert 35% of the energy it consumed to light and the remaining 65% to heat. Which can still be quite a bit of heat.\r\n\r\nHigh temperatures are fine for incandescents, but can fry an LED. So high-power LED lights are usually designed to conduct heat away from the LEDs themselves with metal parts.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29708-0e0f7e76-b2db-491c-856d-15e9ea666671-1566236769"}

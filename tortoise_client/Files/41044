{"body":"&gt; In a lawsuit, money can be demanded from the defendant in three ways: a) a fine; b) legal fees of the prosecutor and c) compensation for damages, economic or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThere's punitive damages too.  These basically amount to (a) for civil suits, where a jury awards massive amounts of money to dissuade other companies from doing the same thing.

He is a businessman. But thats just his profession. Actually what he is doing is bring affordable healthcare to the millions of poor people in India and worldwide. While it is true that patents need to be protected for providing incentives for innovation. Practically, patent protection in todays world means protecting the unfair and inhuman practices. Because, the pharma industry is so organized that they jack the prices up by so many times. Most of the new drugs are produced by unorganized pharma in university labs and small r&amp;d units (again mostly with govt funding). But ends up being patented by big sharks who use them as tools to extract that every last drop of blood. \r\n\r\nPatent system has lost its relevance becasue it was initally installed to protect the unorganized researchers. These big pharms should be able to use their abilities to market and manufacture for making money rather than legal blackmaling. How wlse can one explain that a one dollor a day anti-Aids drugs can be manufactured and marketed by Cipla profitably, whereas the Big Pharma charges atleast $400 for that. Over 4000 % profit margins are immoral esp. when many die for not getting them simply for not being able to affotrd them.\r\n\r\nIn another country Hamid would be a Hero. But in India terrorists become Bollywood stars, scamsters become politicians, Criminals run sympathy campaigns to avoid being hanged, Rapists teach religion and enterpreniers portrayed as Thieves.","retrieved_on":1473807455,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t4oa","id":"ct6pb","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"470-58137d29-ad59-4210-a360-150e81a3b7db-1566236758"}

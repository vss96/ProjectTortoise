Gentic typing services warn their clients about this in advance.\r\n\r\nOutward visual appearance is a terrible thing to go by. Within any mixed race coupling the kids are just as likely to take the characteristics of one parent or another, a mix possible even within siblings so you could have a black parent and a white parent and be nearly white, caramel, brown or even patchy.\r\n\r\nYour mistake is the term 'intermarriage'. Marriage itself may not have been legal or accepted, but a white man having a black girlfriend wasn't unlikely.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, a little bit of aborigional blood isn't uncommon, and the mostly male early settlers of North America compensated by taking locals as wives, a practice only aborted when enough white women from the old world could be imported.\r\n\r\nKeeping that in mind, we've also got a huge genetic blend of the very varied white people, from Celt to Slav. It certainly didn't take long for those people to blend in together, despite the relative language differences and the fact that the folks back home might not have touched each other with a ten foot pole.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_teev","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165163257,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":3,"score":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5046-ca03147a-08f4-49b5-a534-6fecbc483ddb-1566236759"}

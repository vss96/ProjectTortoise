The problem is not the commenting style.  The problem is that a hacky bit of code was rushed in to fit a deadline.\r\n\r\nObviously this is something all devs try to avoid if they can ... but I won't pretend.  I've written this code.  You've written this code.  We all have.  It happens.  What bothers me is that there's still an unresolved issue here, and it's not being tracked in the bug database -- just in a comment.  We can predict with near-mathematical certainty that this was the wrong fix, that we will encounter related problems later, and that this line of code has no future in our codebase.  So yeah, there shouldn't be a comment here.  There should be a bug in the database that says \"go figure this bug for real, and make the right fix\".\r\n\r\nThere is a big difference between \"why is this code here\" (because I was pressed for time) and \"why does this code work\" (because it fits into the architecture by doing X, Y, and Z).  This comment doesn't answer the question I want to know; it's just a bit of historic trivia, and it could have been easily summarized by:\r\n\r\n// BUGBUG: This is a hack, being tracked by Bug #123456","controversiality":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166658285,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42098-01148bb3-9328-42fe-ba59-b5ea0342c7d1-1566236774"}

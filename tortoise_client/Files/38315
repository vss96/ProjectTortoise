{"body":"I agree that books promoting Noah's flood as the origin of the grand canyon have no place, unless they are right next to some other book that offers an actual scientific history. (Though this is not akin to ID and textbooks, as this is a giftshop, not a school.) I'd prefer to see many books detailing the scientific history, and apparently [there are](http://www.grandcanyonassociation.org/grand_canyon_bookstore_natural_history.html). This includes such books as [Colorado River: Origin and Evolution](http://www.grandcanyonassociation.org/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=GCA&amp;Product_Code=M10012&amp;Category_Code=NHIST), which chronicles the history of the area \"from the Early Cenozoic Era through recent times\". So the fact that there's a book with a creationist slant to it, when it's next to a whole bunch of other books that are based on science, doesn't bother me. (Somehow I don't feel that I'm getting the whole story from the original author...)\r\n\r\nHowever, making it \"clear that it's a myth based on a work of fiction\" would still be propagating one's opinion, which would be hypocrisy. If you're going to be upset with Christians imposing their view, you'll have to understand if they're upset if you impose your own, and just as rightfully so. I agree that we should treat geology as a science and leave religion out of it, but that includes not calling it a myth based on a work of fiction.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_whql","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":-10,"score":-10,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167563949,"author":"carpeliam","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cwj8w","id":"cwja1","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809731,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60009-26943417-8c85-446a-a086-4ba903f38377-1566236780"}

This story has been around for months, it's not a Reddit exclusive or anything. Here's some notes on the topic:\r\n\r\n&gt; In July, New Scientist magazine reported on the files, citing red flags that troubled some scientists. Though the ADS, for example, will be facing chaotic, unruly situations, the reports said volunteers were banned from wearing glasses and contact lenses to prevent possible eye damage. In other tests, volunteers were told to remove metallic objects such as keys to avoid \"hot spots\" that might burn skin.\r\n\r\n[source](http://www.alternet.org/story/24044/)\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; The experiments took several precautions for the safety of the volunteers. In all experiments, the volunteers were not allowed to wear glasses or contact lenses, due to concerns about possible eye damage. Additionally, after the first experiment, volunteers were checked for metal objects, such as keys and coins, as well as certain zippers, buttons, and seams, in order to avoid \"hot spots\" that could be created by these objects on the skin of the participants.\r\n\r\n[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System#Testing)\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize, the system works in laboratory conditions, but the real world impact is yet to be known.\r\n\r\nOh, and many are concerned that something like this would be used as a torture/interrogation device.","controversiality":0,"score":19,"ups":19,"created_utc":1165333883,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctpf0","parent_id":"t1_ctp8q","author":"BraveSirRobin","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807806,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9087-b333766c-084e-4126-9005-a028a25cb6bf-1566236760"}

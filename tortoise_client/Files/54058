You jest, surely.  I counsel reading some *history* of the region -- in addition to your misunderstanding of the nature of the Syrian state, you should be a little more specific when using \"radical Islam\" as a subject.\r\n\r\n&gt; It has always been Israel that has tried to negotiate with \r\n&gt; the Pals. Always Israel that has reached out to its \r\n&gt; neighbors. It is Israel that is constantly attacked, ever \r\n&gt; since its inception.\r\n\r\nThis is, frankly nonsense.  Israel has never negotiated in good faith with the Palestinians, since 1967, and Israel's record of aggression is well-known.  \"Inception\" is an interesting term for the series of terrorism, political blackmail and European guilt that led to the founding of the state.  Since Israel \"reached out\" to Lebanon this year, the mask has not fitted so well, even among the heavily propagandized US public.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vija","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43743-27e09323-d58f-454c-833d-a210dfcc9ca5-1566236774"}

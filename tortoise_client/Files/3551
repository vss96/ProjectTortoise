I came out of a C, VB6, ASP, C#, Java realm and now prefer PHP. Sure, there are some dopes out there. If someone doesn't know CSS or a DIV tag or they make a statement like, \"I just learned how to add HTML to my PHP last month,\" or cannot even describe to me how a web server works with any mention of sockets, headers, POST, GET, and so on -- they aren't going to get hired by me.\r\n\r\nI've been offered jobs in New York City, and used to commute there 4 days of the week by plane from another city outside of the Northeastern USA. However, I won't work there anymore because I just like raising my family in a more quiet place with people I can actually get to know and never fear.\r\n\r\nNow if the guy had a telecommute option with a chance of a long-term career and occasional in-office meeting every 3-4 months, my eyes would definitely light up. But those opps just don't seem to be out there, or the salary is far below $60K.\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1167592430,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60536-ed3fb0da-0a3b-4bd4-8560-141b05ba5167-1566236780"}

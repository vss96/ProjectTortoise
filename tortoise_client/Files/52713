I'm all for keeping methods short, but my definition of short is that they should generally fit on a page in your IDE.  (maybe 30 lines)  It is not necessary to be able to ready the entire code in the Javadoc!  Furthermore, have you tried to read someone's code where it time after time bounces from one 2-5 line function to another over and over?  This guy must be a LISP programmer at heart.  Plus with that many functions, you get outrageously long function names which is a pet peeve of mine.  I hate having to split a line of code into several to keep it within the 80 characters per line rule that most coding standards call for.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808090,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu1l5","id":"cu4mm","author":"ccamp","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16195-1e05bd9f-4640-45fc-9bba-f8224a3fc4d0-1566236763"}

Yes, men like breasts.\r\n\r\nPoint noted.\r\n\r\nNow, that we've noted that, can we all agree that the \"OMG BREASTS\" and comments requesting naked photos (which i might add received fewer down mods than the -actual- legitimate point of contention, that people might in fact be sexist) are largely if not totally irrelevant to the blog post?\r\n\r\nIt's about t-shirts, not breasts, for crying out loud!\r\n\r\nSo, i apologize codewalker, but i'm not terribly interested in your breasts, and i really wish the discussion had stuck to inequity of t-shirt ordering, and not on your specific body (which was my point in the first place!)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_v4hp","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34705-bbeaf945-a5a8-487a-8b0b-2344ea1842cc-1566236771"}

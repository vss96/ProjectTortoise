{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ug5r","body":"Heh, well, I don't clame to be all knowing, and I appreciate corrections when I am wrong. The [Communist Manifesto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto) (1848) seems to predate the [Paris Commune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune) (1871), though. When I refer to communism I am talking about what Marx and Engels outlined in the manifesto.\r\n\r\nEdit: just finished reading the Wikipedia page. Yeah, you're right. Looks like Marx himself looked to the Paris Commune as an example of communism if only a partially realized one.\r\n\r\nI should have been more careful in the wording of my original post. In retrospect use of the word state obviously shows the influence of the various failed \"communist\" (using it in the common rather than original sense here) states (USSR, etc.). \r\n\r\nAgain, restating what I have in other replies. The primary intention of my original comment was that privately owned businesses are by definition not communist. I think referring to them as such shows an even greater ignorance than I have displayed of what the word means.","controversiality":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165936903,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cuj7y","edited":false,"id":"cuksi","author_flair_text":null,"author":"djwhitt","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808396,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24871-90cbc22b-df4a-49e1-9f0f-eb1af4aaee53-1566236767"}

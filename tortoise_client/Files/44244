However, in such public places as hospitals where patients could easily represent a handful of beliefs and cultures at the same time, it could be a little overbearing to be faced with a continuous barrage of any one culture during any one period.  This is something that can be easily resolved.  Decorations, etc. could be displayed in rooms, wards, etc. where the patients are all agreed on this point.  Another solution is to allow such representations around the bed of each individual patient.  It is unfair to declare that a hospital is solely Christian if it accepts patients from the wider population.  Likewise, Christian folk could be highly offended if presented with Islamic or any other imagery.  Secularity of these common areas is clearly the best option.\r\n\r\nHowever, this brings me to the article in today's Independent about the Hajj and the resurgence of religious feeling among Islamic visitors from Britain.  Quite frankly, this does get me incensed.  Good luck to them and may they thoroughly enjoy the Hajj.  They have every right.  But for our newspapers to comment at length of the isolation they feel in British society stinks of an effort to get Britons to reflect about the way of life and, thus, the negative comments made by Britains about the public infiltration of things and ideas Islamic in our free country.  If all devout Islamic people wish to queue through all the airports and ports and return to Mecca and all points of the Middle East, they are most welcome.  I will join Jack Straw et al to say how unacceptable to my eyes it is to walk down a street of my home country and be faced with the unacceptable veil wearers milling around.  It is the most outrageous, unacceptable face of chained and abused women.  I don't wish to hear their side of their indoctrinated arguments.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167408556,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cwd5w","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wd45","author_flair_text":null,"author":"fuschia","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809616,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56886-1cd83108-b47f-4850-aa75-392b166b7034-1566236779"}

It happens to be an agenda I do not share. Someone is entirely deluded if they believe that removing religion from the world is somehow 'freedom of religion' -- it is the exact opposite. Freedom of religion does not mean a lack of it, it means an abundance of it.\r\n\r\nFor those who say atheism is not a religion, I would say they are hypocrites since they cite freedom of religion laws in their own defence.\r\n\r\nAs for 'I am suprised you dont also find these things scary' --- The fact is, documentaries especially those deliberately designed to be one-sided *CANNOT BE TRUSTED*. This goes for *ANY SUBJECT*. If I as a producer of a documentary set out with a goal 'I want to make it seem that all Christian summer camps are bad' -- then you bet the documentary will strip out all the good points. Let someone follow you with a camera all day recording only what they wish, have them post it on the net, and just see how bad you look. Conversely, the same is possible in reverse. It is quite easy to make a documentary making Christian summer camp look great.\r\n\r\nThat said, the majority of my posts is a defence of Christianity in general -- *NOT* this specific camp and this specific instance.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20785-dc816298-0e68-46f3-be41-f7700d3ce09d-1566236765"}

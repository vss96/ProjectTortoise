There are potentially good students with poor parents, but under the current system, they're stuck with their shitty neighborhood school in the area that their parents can afford, assuming no busing.\r\n\r\n&gt;Low-income mouth-breather parents are going to choose the best schools? They won't elect to put their kids in the school that has the best football or basketball team?\r\n\r\n&gt;Where are we going to get all these good teachers? If 10% of the schools are \"good\", and everyone wants to send kids to them, there aren't enough desks. The \"bad\" schools go under, the good schools expand... but in doing so, need to hire ever more marginal teachers. Until they themselves are no longer \"good\".\r\n\r\nNote the contradiction here.  First you say people aren't going to send their kids to good schools, then you say there will be too much demand for good schools.\r\n\r\n&gt;We are talking about the same kind of companies, after all, that think that it's acceptable to give me 6megabit DOCSIS over 25 year old coax for $70 a month, while the rest of the world gets 100megabit fiber for a fraction of the cost.\r\n\r\nNot necessarily.  If the standards for accreditation were reasonable, anybody with a few hundred thousand dollars of seed money will be able to set up a school.  You could talk to other parents (no doubt there would be websites for this purpose) to find out which schools were good.  The market would work as advertised.\r\n\r\nContrast that the the oligopoly that controls your internet connection.  Here, I can choose between RoadRunner and Southwestern Bell DSL.  Not much competition, and predictable, shitty results, as you observe.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166994279,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48987-386e70af-fecf-4678-98c9-626acdae3091-1566236777"}

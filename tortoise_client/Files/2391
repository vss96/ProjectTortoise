If people hate Verizon... switch. \r\n\r\nMy overall point is that Apple is free to do whatever they want on their phone. If they choose to sell it unlocked only then they are making a direct consumer play. Other handset vendors sell unlocked phones, but they are conflicted - they also sell via the carriers and derive marketshare that way. Apple doesn't so they can simply put out a kickass phone that is radically better than anything else and that you ca buy unlocked and use on, say, any GSM network. If this is combined with iPod features and is a significantly better phone or is just cooler, they may get traction and begin a trend of seeing phones as consumer devices. \r\n\r\nOr they may not. But FenPhen's point that Apple cannot do this due to the carriers is incorrect. They certainly can, they just may not be picked up as a subsidized device by carriers. \r\n\r\nat the end of the day, you can't complain about the feature set that a carrier offers while taking their subsidy.","controversiality":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1166394264,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv553","id":"cv5b0","author_flair_text":null,"author":"corwin","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808779,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34563-aa2c4c9c-3ab6-4c4c-bd18-fade7e1e0a43-1566236771"}

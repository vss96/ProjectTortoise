The people of all those parts of the country weren't *all* converted to the religion of Islam and then back to Hinduism.. (This \"surge\" of green taking over most of India is shown in the map and is incorrect..)\r\n\r\n- Also, after the formation of Buddhism, it first spread in India. i.e a lot of Hindu's started practicing Buddhism, which was promoted by one of the strongest emperor (Asoka?). The emperor and his followers were responsible in spreading Buddhism to the east (China..). And later, due to a new more \"profound\" philosophy (sect?) of Hinduism developed (and possibly due to the demise of the empire of the Buddhist emperor) a large number of Indians switched back to practicing Hinduism.. (This \"surge\" of Buddhism which covered most of India, isn't shown..)\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n***But, some things are plainly WRONG...***\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n[Religion in China (link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China#Religion):-\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; The majority of Chinese officially identify themselves as non-religious, which constitute about 59% of the population, or about 767 million people.[77] However, religion and rituals play a significant part in the lives of many, especially the traditional beliefs of Confucianism and Taoism. About 33% of the population follow a mixture of beliefs usually referred to by statisticians as \"Traditional Beliefs\" or just \"Other\".\r\n\r\n&gt; About 6% of the Chinese population are avowed Buddhists, with Mahayana Buddhism and its subsets Pure Land and Zen being the most widely practiced..\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nEven in the final stage ALL of north America is shown to be christian\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41186-7312763e-0e18-4739-9d25-fc813715bf32-1566236773"}

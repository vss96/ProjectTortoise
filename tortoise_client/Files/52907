There is no formula.  \r\n\r\nYet, in regards to the broadaning of your intitial question, well, I really and truly think a questioning of the mechanics regarding a specific type of humor naturally leads to an ontological review of humor in its entirety.  That is how my mind works anyhow. I tend to go from specific to broad then back to specific again.\r\n\r\nI cannot speak for Notclevr so I don't know if he felt sympathy for you or not.  His comment seamed to evoke in me a sense that there is more to this type of humor than junior high-school bullying though.  \r\n\r\nLet me go on.  Yes fart jokes, low humor doesn't take much skill in creating or for understanding.  One doesn't need an education, even young children get it and their sense of humor is usually unevolved, lacking the nuance of irony or sarcasm for instance.  You pretty much nailed it, nervousness, laughs, a release of tension.  But as for cheap, I think most people when they laugh, and I mean really laugh, don't discriminate much about the source.  It is a pleasurable physical response. Isn't something that elicits genuine laughter by definition humor?  So I think if you're missing out on that simple pleasure one might sympathize with you.  Also, I think people allow themselves to be more susceptible to frivolous humor. There is nothing wrong with laughing about something frivolous.  It doesn't make you less intelligent or less able to get that complicated joke with all of its references and allusions.  It doesn't mean your less evolved.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807518,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cta2e","parent_id":"t1_ct9kc","author":"trivial","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2108-a5e64810-103d-40c4-afad-1f545b6836aa-1566236758"}

All those things can help--even if it's with your calmness, confidence, distancing, or general movement. Wrestling/grappling is great to know, but it's main problem is with closing the distance betwen you and your opponent without getting beaten senseless on the way. IOW, don't go for a take down against some guy who knows how to throw a muay thai knee. \r\n\r\nMainly, though, so much of this is conditional upon the situation, you can't make blanket statements about one approach over another.","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42765-a11f2f4c-2fae-46bc-be68-ee42d610b7ab-1566236774"}

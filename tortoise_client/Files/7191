{"controversiality":0,"body":"I don't know about other countries, but if you're considering moving to the US to avoid cigarette smoke then let me reccomend Utah and California.\r\n\r\nCalifornia has certain areas that as I recall have the most restrictive laws in the US concerning cigarette smoke.  It is very liberal and is making the laws more restrictive with time.  I've not lived in California before so I can't tell you much else about it.\r\n\r\nUtah has fairly restrictive laws, as opposed to very restrictive, but has a very large percentage of Mormons.  Mormonism has rules against it's members taking up smoking.  I'm actually surprised how permissive the laws are and how many people smoke here in Utah, considering that most Mormons actually take that rule pretty seriously, and that Mormons are a large enough portion of the population here to outright dictate terms in any election.\r\n\r\nIf you do move to Utah I reccomend Bountiful if you can afford the apartment prices.  Unfortunately it's a bit of a drive from where I currently work or I'd still live there.  It has an even higher percentage of Mormons than even Salt Lake.  The important difference is that it has a small enough percentage of smokers that you can typically make it into and out of the grocery store and government buildings without needing to walk past someone who is smoking right next to the door.  The downsides are that it is essentially a suburb of Salt Lake City, so you'll likely have to find a job there and commute back and forth each day, and the apartment prices are expensive, compared to those in Salt Lake.\r\n\r\nAnother upside is that the scenery is beautiful, while in Salt Lake much of the natural beauty of this state is obscured by buildings, though some is still visible here as well.\r\n\r\nIf you can handle living in an area with a single coherant dominant religion it's a nice area, especially if you were to convert.  If you don't like the local religion then you might want to try California.  As far as I know, no single religion there has more than a third of the population, unless you count all Christians as belonging to the same religion, in which case you can't escape religion in the US.\r\n\r\nI will admit openly that I don't like the local religion, so it gets on my nerves.  On the other hand the smoking laws are generally livable, and most of my family lives within 50 miles of me.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ubmh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165806177,"author":"Joss","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cudrd","id":"cudwr","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808265,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21351-1b5b7a07-f26f-493d-b247-e944da1367c3-1566236765"}

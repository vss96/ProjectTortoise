True, my sense of taste is diminished, but I have good days and bad days as far as that's concerned.  Some foods like soups and stews have absolutely no taste for me now and make me kind of queasy when I eat them, but for the most part it's fine.  It all comes down to texture.\r\n\r\nAs for the smell, well ... if you think about it, most strong smells that people notice tend be things like farts, rotting food etc.  Definitely don't miss those!  But things like chocolate chip cookies baking, lasagna, my boyfriend's cologne - yeah, I miss those.  Overall, I think I'd rather lose my sense of smell than my other senses.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w6lz","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809547,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Dracomere","id":"cw9fb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w6lz","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55054-ced617c9-fbf4-45c1-965d-19b1e080c5db-1566236779"}

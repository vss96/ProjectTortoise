When ever they ask a question about a non-safety issue I sometimes made up an answer. Like, 'the sky is blue because of tiny blue bacteria in the upper atmosphere.' \r\n\r\nThey loved it. They still do, though as teenagers my chance of getting away with much is limited. The side effect is that they are very solid critical thinkers. \r\n\r\nSo then I started doing this in lectures. I don't do it once a lecture. More like once every second or third. Like the prof mentioned in the post, the students love it, and I fully intend to continue this. I do this while teaching geographic information science and geology courses, which of course are a bit different than economics. The real difference is that in a subject full of documentary 'facts' it is trivial to put in a 'lie' but those don't count. Saying that the Grand Canyon is 57 Ma old is not easily detectible from reasoning by the students. I far to prefer to tell them that a good piece of it used to flow down a canyon to the southeast and into NW New Mexico. Which they all immediately challenge as a fake. Which is doubly great because it is actually as far as we know, true. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is to challenge them (or kids, for that matter) on concepts where they can reason through the process and see the contradiction. Listing false atomic facts is not nearly as powerful a rhetorical technique.","score":31,"ups":31,"created_utc":1167400147,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_wbx5","edited":false,"id":"cwcr7","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Random","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809609,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56675-ede3b26b-a929-4448-85a0-9657531ac468-1566236779"}

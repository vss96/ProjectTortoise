Lazy and inaccurate.  Even if you read the bible you will see actions and events that take place between \"Jews\" and the people around them.  It is a history of events that leads them to be hated, not some \"chosen\" status.  That \"chosen\" status may be what has led to some of the events but you cannot lay the hatred of the \"Jews\" at the feet of some fiat of God.\r\n\r\nFor example, Jews who according to the bible were to be a blessing to others, knowing that God said they should not charge usury to each other, were quite comfortable to burden others with this.  Were they being a blessing to others when they did this. Ultimately there are two factors that have led to their being hated, it is their acts of disobedience, and the disobedience of those who hate them.  The \"Jews\" were \"chosen\" to be a blessing, not to be a scourge.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808761,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cv48w","parent_id":"t1_cv2fi","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rahrahrah","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33966-b57696f1-c3b8-4cb9-affb-745eb4049107-1566236771"}

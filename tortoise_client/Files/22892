Long ago they decided to pursue a low-cost strategy -- build a ton of the same car on a massive single line and hope you can sell them all.  Unfortunately, in today's market, demand is so dynamic that you can't afford to take such risks.  Toyota meanwhile can develop cars in a year's less time and produce them on the same assembly lines, which affords them the flexibility to adjust supply to demand.

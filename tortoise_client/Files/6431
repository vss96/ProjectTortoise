{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt;As a 12 year old I attended a Christian summer camp -- had a fantastic time, had memories that will live with me forever and I met new friends, and overall had a great time. There is NOTHING WRONG with Christian summer camp, and the vile hatred which exists against Christians is just plain wrong and totally unwarranted.\r\n\r\nYou go from saying that because you liked your Christian summer camp, there is nothing wrong with camps like these, which is a logical fallacy. If you actually watched this movie, you'd see they ADMIT their goal is to train an army of suicide bombers to kill atheists and the way Muslims in Israel and Iraq do.\r\n\r\n&gt;Instead of creating opinions for someone, instead of assuming someone was brainwashed, or had ideas PUSHED on them, why dont you go to the source? \r\n\r\nThis sentence makes no sense.\r\n\r\n&gt;Just because a kid is against abortion does not mean they are brainwashed\r\n\r\nAnother logical fallacy. The issue is whether what was done is brainwashing, not whether anyone against abortion in brainwashed.\r\n\r\n&gt;and a hatred of those who believe ending ANY life is bad, is both unwarranted and uncalled for.\r\n\r\nAnother logical fallacy for the same reason.\r\n\r\n&gt;It is unfair to judge someone by watching a third party documentary, and then to say \"Oh this is scary\" or \"Oh they are brainwashing these kids\"\r\n\r\nNo it isn't.  It's not like they took a ten second clip out of context, this actually happened.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ua04","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165762353,"author":"xk5","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cubu3","parent_id":"t1_cubii","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808226,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20162-199a020a-e110-47ec-97d5-d043fc7e949a-1566236765"}

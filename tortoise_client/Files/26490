It isn't about SQL at all, it is about query comprehension.\r\n\r\nLINQ can query across any data source that support IEnumerable, including XML and object collections. Even you never use it for database access, it is still helpful for normal programming.\r\n\r\nFor database support, even [SQLite](http://www.infoq.com/news/sqlite) has taken the time to create LINQ drivers. So you know the big names like Oracle and MySQL are not going to miss the boat.\r\n\r\nIt is more complex, but from what I have seen so far it isn't too hard for the simple case of creating an object collection from a stored proc or SQL statment.\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165535239,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14893-79ae2196-1495-4f19-a05f-be18d56da891-1566236762"}

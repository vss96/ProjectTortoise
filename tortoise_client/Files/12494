The private school my daughter attended was the same one I attended.  (I enrolled her because they had a much more PC marketing kit and pretended they had changed - from the time I was in attendance.)  I was an alum, my mother had been president of the Board Of Directors and had donated the very strategic plan which resulted in me thinking it was the right place for my child.  \r\n\r\nWhen I met with the Head Of School about three diferent times about three distinctly inappropriate issues - I was told that I \"needed to work on my attitude towards the administration and trust in their professional credentials rather than consistently challenge them.\"  They said this to a family who had donated over $600,000 in the past 30 years - over and above full tuition fees.  When my father (an attorney) confronted them about the legal ramifications of one of their decisions - they simply repeated that we needed to fix *our* attitude.  They were very surprised and upset when we left.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to more accurately assess and analyze the media's constant bombarding of inappropriate behaviour - you have to either a) watch and discuss the idiot box with them constantly; b) buy them a subscription to New Moon Magazine, which is like Ms for 8 year olds;  and/or b) toss the idiot box, homeschool and only allow for this crap while visiting friends.  (They have to have a diverse group of friends.  Many will have an idiot box in their home.)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wdrb","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58704-790aa9dc-440b-4c25-9c42-d53d1613b67b-1566236780"}

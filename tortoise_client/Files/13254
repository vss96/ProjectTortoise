Are they \"reasonable\" just because they are the majority.\r\n\r\nAnd statements like this just erodes our right.\r\n\r\n&gt; Once your foot traverses the entranceway of a commercial airliner, you are no longer in a democracy in which everyone gets a vote and minority rights are affirmatively protected in the furtherance of fuzzy, every-shifting social policy.\r\n\r\nAnd what happens when someone decides to replace \"entranceway of a commercial airliner\" with \"public place\".\r\n\r\nIf you are too scared to fly or be in public, then don't. Stay home and be scared. Just don't go infringing on the rights of us rational people.","retrieved_on":1473808873,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cva7b","parent_id":"t1_cv8yi","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jubjub123","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37049-e87d415b-9ff3-45d9-9aaa-eb48e509bb81-1566236772"}

Global warming is a global phenomenon, referring to a net increase in the average global temperature as more energy from the sun gets trapped in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nLocal climate changes will vary considerably - some areas may get warmer, others colder (Europe stands to get much colder, actually). Some may not change much at all. Looking at any one spot on the globe and noting that it's a lot warmer than normal does nothing to prove or disprove a global phenomenon. It's just one data point you'd have to consider among thousands of others.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vm6j","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809125,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ejp1082","id":"cvn93","parent_id":"t3_vm6j","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43527-cc2773fb-d446-4e83-8d8f-f60b4ead126d-1566236774"}

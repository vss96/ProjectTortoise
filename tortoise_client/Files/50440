If implemented correctly, it can not only serve the purpose of filtering out undesirable content but also suggest new types of stories (like the author's 3am Norwegian salmon bit). This not only exposes one to content he may not otherwise encounter, but also gives a user the opportunity to promote such an article for others to see. I'm surprised the author didn't mention reddit for this reason.","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13161-36b6f852-a435-4607-8cb0-def7ae487fde-1566236762"}

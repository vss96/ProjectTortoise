But adding new things to a programming language isn't always more, sometimes its even less. But there are things which really fit well into Java. Properties may fit, and if they use the proposed syntax both parties will be ok with it, even if no one will really cheer.\r\n\r\nQuery comprehension is a different and difficult topic. On one hand its better that simply using an O/R mapper but on the other can it create really slow applications if one does to many queries and the caching mechanisms fail. \r\n\r\nCreating the right implementation is not really simple. To do it good we need lots of compiler support doing static checks to predict access patterns and build clever caching from this. Doing it mainly in the libs (like LINQ) can backfire.\r\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167422842,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t1_cwdtj","edited":false,"id":"cwe1k","author_flair_text":null,"author":"kawa","retrieved_on":1473809633,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57366-a5375005-9a99-4abb-80df-1190e2a77fa5-1566236779"}

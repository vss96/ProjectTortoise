Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council (Tory-controlled) has now announced that, following a complaint by a Muslim employee, all work pictures and knick-knacks of novelty pigs and \"pig-related items\" will be banned. Among the verboten items is one employee's box of tissues, because it features a representation of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet. And, as we know, Muslims regard pigs as \"unclean\", even an anthropomorphised cartoon pig wearing a scarf and a bright, colourful singlet.\r\n\r\n**edit**: Looks like I'm being modded down for quoting an opinion piece from The Telegraph. Doesn't anyone else think that freedom of speech (in this case the right to have a picture of Piglet!) is more important than political correctness?","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ugjk","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808322,"distinguished":null,"author":"isalpha","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cugq9","edited":false,"id":"cugwb","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22908-777eabc7-fa06-4e59-96d5-d42beb067d70-1566236766"}

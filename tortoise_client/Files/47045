Product developers and manufacturers are often itching to give out freebies to tech influencers because it's smart marketing. Do you really think Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal goes to some secret underground Apple Store to buy his hot new iPod to review a month before it's even announced? Do you think hardware review sites sneak into processor fabs late at night to gain access to hardware samples that won't be on retail shelves for months? Do you really think they're sending all of that stuff back? Some are, some aren't, and to be honest, I have no idea if Mossberg keeps the top-secret stuff he's sent or not. For someone like Mossberg or someone like me, keeping the stuff isn't one-fifth as important as just having access to it in a timely fashion. That whole angle has been largely lost in this discussion, and it's a shame. \r\n\r\n","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167411928,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56981-480dcd49-b5a3-446e-8da7-e8868e0dc511-1566236779"}

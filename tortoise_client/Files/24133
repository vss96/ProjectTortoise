{"controversiality":0,"body":"I just told of one. The school my son attended -- although I do not know *For Certain* that they send students to a special school. They *Might* Warn, Suspend Expell. \r\n\r\nUsing special stories that make the tabloids like the pellet gun story doesn't serve anything in a conversation like this. It's not likely to happen very often.\r\n\r\nMy son was involved in a scuffle and got a warning. He (and the other kid) stayed out of trouble after that. Nobody that I heard of was warned, suspended or expelled without just cause -- and I was paying attention -- on the contrary, some acts of violence slipped through the cracks, that is, I didn't personally think they were strict enough.\r\n\r\nI hope I'm reading you wrong when I suspect you're one of the folks who find fault with ANY plan. Zero tolerance works. It's not perfect, but nothing is, last time I checked.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w17r","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167173083,"author":"DA5lD","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cw3ef","edited":false,"id":"cw3gn","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809432,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51843-89156b44-d029-4c85-8be4-f76076f24a49-1566236778"}

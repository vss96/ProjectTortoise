{"body":"I suppose econ classes made me slightly more fiscally conservative in some respects, but I'm still far left of center.  And actually, I've used some things I learned in econ classes to argue *against* some of the more extreme conservative views my father has.\r\n\r\n*Edit - I think both sides of the conventional American political spectrum are equally capable of failing to realize that their pet priorities have costs, and taking a \"by any means necessary\" attitude instead of examining the tradeoffs inherent in any policy choice.  Trying not to use that kind of faulty reasoning is one of the biggest effects learning some economics has had on me.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vcvm","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166563436,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rhebert","parent_id":"t3_vcvm","id":"cveu8","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808960,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39334-5eff39d3-bfaa-4048-9a6d-0d11bf97a98d-1566236773"}

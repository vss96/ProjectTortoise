IMO the biggest failing of the prison system has nothing to do with abuse from guards, its the misapplication of punishment.  Sure, violent offenders should be in prison but there's got to be something better figured out for non-violent drug and/or property (theft) crimes that presents with a better chance for the people to leave prison and not return to crime.  They've got to earn real money and learn a real skill.  It just seems that there's so much that needs to be changed in the prison system.  This video just seemed a pretext to fit the show title but didn't address the biggest problems.  Hell, in reality, I would be shocked if there were more that 2-3 less abusive prison systems in the world since prisoners in the US have fairly good abilities to raise lawsuits (and paying out money speaks very clearly to prison officials I'm guessing).\r\n\r\nAnyway, not bad, but really didn't seem an open minded attempt to pursue the roots of a problem IMO.

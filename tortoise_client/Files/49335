People like to rag on VB, but when pressed most people flat out refuse to answer. The ones that do either complain about stuff that was fixed eons ago or are debatable like case sensitivity. It is rare that I hear real complaints, which sucks because I want the language to grow.\r\n\r\nIf we are going to have a real discussion about langauge design, let us not start with blanket statments like language X is bad or language Y is good. Those should be the conclusions, not the assumptions.\r\n\r\nWhat I find especially aggravating is that VB takes a lot of flack from both sides.\r\n\r\nJava and C# developers don't like it because it supports late binding, you don't have to explicitly specify types, it has optional parameters, and can be changed at runtime with Edit and Continue.\r\n\r\nPython and Ruby developers don't like it because it statically bound, requires types, everything has to be declared in advance, and cannot be changed at runtime.\r\n\r\nLately you have the DSL supporters that want languages to look more like English. But in the mean time you have others complaining that VB is too verbose and English-like.\r\n\r\nSo which is it this time? Too static? Too dynamic? Too verbose? Not english enough?","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808671,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuzep","edited":false,"id":"cuzki","author":"grauenwolf","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31847-bebc706a-5a7a-4317-84ab-597a3137a30a-1566236770"}

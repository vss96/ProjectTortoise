Sure, if you had unlimited funds and lawyers at your beckoning, you might want to go after a single private citizen and spite them by bankrupting them/hassling them with court.  However, in reality, Wal-Mart doesn't give a damn about spiting you or anyone else; maybe an individual manager or employee does, but no company officer would ever approve such a waste of resources. \r\n\r\nFirst, they want to keep you as a customer, even if you're difficult--a lifetime of lost sales, even for a single individual is a significant amount of money.\r\n\r\nSecond, they don't want any type of bad press that could affect sales--they certainly would not risk this just to spite someone.\r\n\r\nThird, sure Wal-Mart could tie you up in court for countless hours, but those are hours that their attorney is billing them at $300/hr.  Do you really think they want to spend thousands of dollars to spite a customer into never shopping with them again? Think again. \r\n\r\nA manager might threaten you, but if your situation reaches the lawsuit level, you'll likely get a call from some corporate MBA voicing a pleasant apology and offering a gift certificate--this is far and away the best tack for a corporation like Wal-Mart to take, and they're smart enough to take it.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164940723,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"340-b9fe0286-b8a3-4d9b-99c1-29b2f961e757-1566236758"}

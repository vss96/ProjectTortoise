The question is why do we tolerate kleptocracies and governmental coercive redistribution that hurts the wealth creation process that empirically lifts people out of poverty?\r\n\r\nThe reason the bulk of the world's richest are that wealthy is they created that wealth. We need to restructure our society so that the **opportunity** to create wealth is open to all. Then we merely need to get government out of the way and lt the new wealth creation process happen.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to bemoan how some people are \"inexcusably\" rich, and to take away their wealth. The Soviets, and the Chinese, and the North Koreans, and the Cubans...tries this, and it failed miserably to raise the fortunes of those on the bottom. Hurting the rich doesn't help the poor. Much better to exploit the rich and persuade them to foolishly work at creating more wealth via employing, and enriching in the process, other people.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807824,"gilded":0,"id":"ctqba","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctq5c","author":"happyjuggler0","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9519-481f5716-bbea-435f-aefb-f964ca4493c0-1566236761"}

I work for a charity where I am responsible for fundraising my own budget and salary. About 70% of the fundraising goes to paying my salary, without which I could not do my job of training/equiping/supervising volunteers and running programs (and a little bit of fundraising which accounts for about 5% of my time at work). Of course, I also make no bones about it to my donours- they know that most of their money is going to paying my salary.","controversiality":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165688998,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18760-ed453b5b-8ba9-4ecd-a836-f224a30cc594-1566236764"}

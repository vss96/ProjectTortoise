I've been working on video games for the last 5 years or so. Mostly on the engine side of things: physics, graphics, compilers, networking, general infrastructure, you name it.\r\n\r\nI originally studied pure math in college for a few semesters before I decided to take temporary leave (which later became permanent) to work with [some cool guys](http://www.epicgames.com). But these days I'm living and working in Korea, still on games.\r\n\r\nMy day job is all C++ unfortunately. My favorite languages for hacking are probably Python, Scheme and Haskell. Lately I've been reading/writing a lot of Haskell code.","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4138-acd34b03-21a6-43d2-9731-822ed0c5e9bf-1566236759"}

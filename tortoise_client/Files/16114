This is a convention whereby any identifier between an END and its semicolon automatically signals the end of the procedure with that name, and of any enclosed program structure, even if it has no END of its own.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; At first sight this is a harmless notational convenience, which Peter Landin might call \"syntactic sugar\"; but in practice the consequences are disastrous.  If the programmer accidentally omits an END *anywhere* in his program, it will automatically and without warning be inserted just before the next following labelled END, which is very unlikely to be where it was wanted.  Landin's phrase for this would be \"syntactic rat poison\".","retrieved_on":1473809189,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvqke","parent_id":"t3_vn55","author_flair_text":null,"author":"pjdelport","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45242-a98ae145-813b-448d-9ec6-355e0eee2070-1566236774"}

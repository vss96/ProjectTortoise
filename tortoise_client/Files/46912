I didnt see anywhere in your article that said HDTV will kill internet video except where you said that HDTV will kill internet video.  IV to me isnt about watching movies online in some grainy flash frame, but about watching searchable, soundbytes or minute long news clips.  It is about filtering out a bunch of garbage advertising too.  And it is not just a playground for multibillion dollar media moguls but anybody with a video camera can post a video and compete on the same terms as anyone.\r\n\r\n\"Apple's ITV is promising and Microsoft (a client of my firm) is making the same push with Windows Vista. The TV is undergoing a renaissance but the sources of content will come at from all directions.\"\r\n\r\nThe killer would be to join internet video and regular video.  I would love to browse something like google-video on my regular tv and hopefully have a better quality picture.  You do that, and the whole concept of video and tv changes.\r\n\r\nAnd not to mention the HDTV expense, I think you are living in the clouds.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w0zi","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167120513,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50868-c533f1ef-6e00-443e-8147-5aecf5285b3e-1566236778"}

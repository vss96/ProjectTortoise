Teasing apart what's causing what is extremely difficult.  We are still sort of in the infancy of linking genes to function.  We have genomes for so many species, but we still don't know what genes are responsible for most of the things that make humans unique.  I do think that, now that there is so much data available, there will be a lot of progress in the area, but I do think there will be a limit to what we can figure out.","ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165881072,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cui44","parent_id":"t1_cui3n","author":"emc2rae","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808345,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23612-810ab317-9ea2-4e00-82d7-019b2cf5bf20-1566236766"}

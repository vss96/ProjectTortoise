That is really the only gun the officer needs to qualify for proficiency. If he can use a revolver, great, and more power to him, but there's no reason to disqualify a person from working in the law enforcement field if they can't master a bolt action .306 hunting rifle.\r\n\r\nSecond, as people have pointed out here, stick shifts are going the way of the African Elephant. Try buying an SUV with stickshift. Its even harder to find \"sport sedan\" stick shifts these days than you'd think. Even \"sports cars\" like the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Ford Mustang come in automatic models -- which, by the way, are faster in the quarter mile drag. \r\n\r\nSo again, I can see it being an OPTIONAL skill, but not a required one. Just like while maybe 1% of the population speaks pennslyvannia dutch or navaho, and I can imagine it being a useful skill in certain situations (CSI: Amish Homicide) but not a required skill to be considered proficient in law enforcement.","retrieved_on":1473809720,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cwio8","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwi8c","author_flair_text":null,"author":"redrobot5050","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59684-71cf1d7d-dd05-418d-ac93-2d3ad4da1b1f-1566236780"}

As for challenging politicians who support the war to volunteer their children, Michael Moore already tried this in his movie Fahrenheit 911 – and bush got re-elected anyway – thank you US public. I would recommend urging the Clinton kids to go and serve in iraq as well, since Hilary signed on to authorize bush’s war. Shame on all those fools. Their names should be engraved in stone in a monument that memorializes the people responsible for a war based on the lamest collection of excuses ever given (and a public ready and willing to believe their media whores). sad","retrieved_on":1473809454,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw4kc","parent_id":"t3_w3iu","author_flair_text":null,"author":"lenny247","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52511-09e8deff-1461-45b8-9470-12c5a179d82e-1566236778"}

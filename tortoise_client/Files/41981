And we're still talking about accelerating global warming with the release of carbon into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nDoes everyone understand how dependent we are on petroleum and natural gas? Modern agriculture is based entirely on these two fossil fuels. Without cheap hydrocarbon energy, food will be enormously expensive and less abundant. Americans will be forced to grow their own food locally. There won't be anymore 500 mile ceasar salads.\r\n\r\nAnd all that cheap plastic crap from China that Wal-Mart gets shipped across the ocean is made from petroleum.\r\n\r\nIf we are growing our own food then there won't be a whole lot of available land for corn production which is required to produce ethanol.\r\n\r\nThe hydrogen economy is a joke. It takes more energy (from fossil fuels!) to create a hydrogen fuel cell that you can actually get out of the fuel cell itself. It's an energy sink. A loser for sure.\r\n\r\nPublic transit and railroads are the future of transportation. Flying in planes will only be for the elite which means the death of the commercial airline industryas we currently know it.\r\n\r\nThe age of the American empire is coming to a close.

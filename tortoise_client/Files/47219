Often they are bought to control algae problems in marine reef aquariums.  However, as you say, they are prone to being sucked up into pumps, filters, etc.   One interesting feature of many of the crispatas is that they eat algae and then concentrate the chloroplasts from the algae into their topside folds where they can capture solar energy and create food for the crispata - in other words, they can become solar powered animals.\r\n\r\nReputable marine aquarium shops won't sell most Nudibranchs because they only tend to last for a few days or weeks at best in captivity.\r\n\r\nI've heard that people tend to have better luck with marine flatworms ( http://www.sergeyphoto.com/underwater/miscinverts.html#flatworms ) in captivity and they are also quite colorful.  \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uw25","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166219703,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31498-308a2bdc-d74e-4b8e-9b45-5dafa73769c6-1566236770"}

However, the carriers do insist on feature restrictions and locking the phone to them in return for subsidizing the phone price - if Apple's phone OS doesn't enable this, carriers may not be interested in offering it. HOWEVER.... carrier subsidized phones are not the only ones out there. \r\n\r\nIf this bothers anyone, buy an unlocked phone. And that's the rumor about Apple's phone - that it will be offered unlocked only. \r\n\r\nPeople complain about phones being locked and having dumb restrictions, but won't ante up for an unlocked phone since new unlocked phones with near-cutting edge features are several hundred dollars and most people simply wait until they get something for $100 or less.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_v3zj","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166381238,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34201-8ad64c9a-8803-4664-b430-9f3dfb9acc06-1566236771"}

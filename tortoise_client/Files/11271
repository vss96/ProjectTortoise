Trucking or flying refrigerated goods, which have a short shelf life, drives up the cost.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, things like grains and legumes can be stored dry with no refrigeration for comparatively long periods of time.  Your Taco Bell burrito is made from reconstituted beans; the tortilla is made from reconstituted dried and pulverized grains.  Oils can be kept in plastic bottles for months or years, and sugar doesn't \"go bad\".  That explains the junk foood and healthy food.\r\n\r\nAs for animal products, they are heavily subsidized.  You can buy meat for less than you can buy the corn that animal ate when it was alive.  Ditto for milk.\r\n\r\nIf the meat industry got the kind of government funds the organic veggies industry gets, burgers would cost thirty bucks.\r\n\r\nSo, remember, that 99 cent burger is the result of a kind of \"burger insurance\" paid for by your tax dollars. \r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807836,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctr16","parent_id":"t3_tol1","author":"lemmikins","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9947-64f4c0a2-e6a1-4379-9494-188f1b541bf5-1566236761"}

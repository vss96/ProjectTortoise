{"body":"that's ridiculous. The standard library *IS* part of the language. You can't have a conforming implementation of C++ on a given platform without the library. Approximately half the standard (if not more) is all about the standard library. Writing code in C++ and *NOT* using it is like cutting our your 2nd lung cause \"I only need one\".\r\n\r\nBoost is a great thing, too. Large sections of it are set to be part of the next standard (tentatively set for 2009, from what i hear). It's a solid set of libraries written and implemented by the best of the community (with a few WTF's thrown in, some insane god came up with boost.spirit for example).\r\n\r\n\r\n--vat","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vzw8","subreddit":"programming","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1167138615,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"MachinShin2006","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw1yt","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw0vl","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809404,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51060-4006a2d0-1667-4721-bb33-bcb1e2284f46-1566236778"}

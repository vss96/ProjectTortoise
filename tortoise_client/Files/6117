If you watch the currency markets when big news gets released you see the price move over an extended period - say several hours sometimes. Many times those statistics are being released by the government and there is no insider activity. Even if the government wanted to use the inside info, forex is too big to move. \r\n I think computer tagged news is a great idea. You could setup something that says \"Watch the wire for latest unemployment numbers, if they are worse than expected by more than 5-10% short that nations currency\". You can do that in real time but you have to sit in front of the pc at the moment the stat is released. \r\n All in all I think this will bring about more efficient markets, being able to back test news stories to see their relative impact on prices will be another advantage.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165866130,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cuh2g","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uf4k","author":"jstco","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808325,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23002-8ff4e8de-8a01-4300-a884-7ebff64397a4-1566236766"}

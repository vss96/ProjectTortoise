And I think this argumentative bullshit about Saddam's personal culpability vs. authoritative responsibility for thousands of deaths is irrelevant. I read of a Kurdish woman, after one of his attacks, gazing out from some railroad car window watching a dog eat the remains of her baby. So, after that, a hanging is the least he deserves. It has nothing to do with whether he is civilized or we are civilized or if mercy is civilized, or if murdering a murderer is murder or if he could be redeemed or if this is a deterrent message to others or not.

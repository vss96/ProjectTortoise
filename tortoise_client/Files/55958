{"body":"No matter how hard you try, you can't cut steel with a screwdriver, or put in screws with a bandsaw.  But (and you can even prove this mathematically) any programming language can do anything any other programming language can do.  So the language in which you have the most experience naturally seems the only one necessary -- learning a new language is a lot of work, and you wouldn't be able to do anything you couldn't do with the language you've already got.\r\n\r\nI don't buy this argument, however.  Learning a new language is actually pretty fun, and even if thing `a` is _possible_ in languages `x` and `y`, it could be very easy to do in `x`, while very hard to realize in `y`.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8gy","subreddit":"programming","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1167302049,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"panic","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw8kl","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w8gy","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809532,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54669-2425cdc6-4a7d-41dc-8dd7-b956301945f8-1566236779"}

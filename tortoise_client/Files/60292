We've even had a couple of occasions to meet each other, exchange ideas and set some rough plans for the future.  Here is my attempt at summing up 2006 in darcs-land, although I might not be the best person to ask.\r\n\r\nWe've had one new darcs release in the summer (1.0.8) and are working on getting a new one out the door.  We've got release candidates for the latest version, but are hesitating on including some more bugfixes and improvements.  To get an idea of the pace of change, we have had a total of 365 (heh) patches accepted into the unstable repository since 2006-01-01, pretty evenly spread out across the year.\r\n\r\nWhat's new?\r\n\r\n1. David Roundy and other developers are working on a better way of dealing with conflicts (which will hopefully resolve the infamous doppelganger patch problem).  It's a tricky problem, and we have a candidate solution, although there is some debate whether or not it is the right way to go about things.\r\n\r\n2. One of the major developments has been a wideish code refactor and new work on a \"hashed inventory\" feature.  This is useful in itself as an asset in consistency checking or security (think cryptographic signing of repositories), but it will also pave the way for other major improvements like lazy partial repositories and especially, the new approach to conflict-handling.\r\n\r\n3. Whilst David and friends are worrying about the core issues, we have been receiving a lot of outside contributions improving the day-to-day experience of darcs.  Out of 365 patches this past year, only 20% are from David himself, whereas the rest are from the community of users.\r\n\r\nWe have recently gone through a wide-ish code refactor, which will make it easier to do the important stuff (improved conflict handling).  The refactor is motivated by desired to implement a new \"hashed inventory\" feature (which will, in turn, pave the way for David's new conflict handling code)\r\n\r\nYou can read more in the latest\r\nHaskell Communities and Activities Report (http://haskell.org/communities/11-2006/html/report.html \r\n ; search for Roundy), on Tommy Pettersson's 2006-12-20 update on the upcoming 1.0.9 release, or by browsing the darcs-devel archives.  The archives contain meetup notes, if you want to get an idea what darcs folk are thinking about.","link_id":"t3_wg1p","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809718,"distinguished":null,"author":"EricKow","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwim8","parent_id":"t1_cwgmg","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59660-c82339a4-5327-491f-b0fb-5fad0c0e2544-1566236780"}

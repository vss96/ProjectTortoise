If some \"big idiot\" couldn't keep up with my insults in that situation then I'm sure that his next though would be \"well, maybe I could take him.\" If \"shit-talking\" is a means to an end, fighting, then I chose not to participate... not due to a deficiency in stones but because if I were to fight I'd probably just end up in jail and then have to deal with all of the BS that's associated with it.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809588,"gilded":0,"id":"cwbny","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwbma","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56199-389288c0-314d-4211-a548-5bc9ed3372f0-1566236779"}

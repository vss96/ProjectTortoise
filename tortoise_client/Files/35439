Best way to disarm and completely control your opponent without violence and without hurting him (although you can cause damage if it turns out to become a life or death thing).\r\n\r\nTry not to cause damage, hurt or even ridicule people, even if you win, many will be pissed off badly and you never know if that guy will come back once he's 15 and rape your little daughter just for revenge for the disgrace.\r\n\r\nAvoid fights and if there's really no way out try to come to and end of the fight that leaves room for reconciliation.

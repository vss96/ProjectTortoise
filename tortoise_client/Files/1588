{"controversiality":0,"body":"(from the article, just after the part richardkulisz quoted..)\r\n\r\n&gt; “Many of the women are there because they have married without their parents’ permission and a parent has filed a case. If they are not in jail, they will be killed by their tribes. These are girls of 14, 16, and they beg us, ‘Don’t let us out or we will be killed’. - Razia Aziz\r\n\r\n***If*** that is true, which I suspect it is, the new law may result in an increase in honor killings, at least in places like Peshawar.(maybe not true for more educated populations. )\r\n\r\nIf you look at the Indian part of Punjab and other north Indian states, which I believe, have a similar culture (although not the same religion) to a lot of Pakistan, even stricter laws to protect women's rights have not really changed a whole lot. (Female foetecide/infanticide, dowry and murders due to dowry, etc..)\r\n\r\nI can not comment more, as I don't know Pakistani culture (esp the rural life). But if the aim is to reduce rapes and  other atrocities against Pak women, a more thorough approach is needed, and a change in laws by the gov., *exclusively*, without necessary education of the masses and support from the local police, may be more harmful at least in the near future.\r\n\r\nYou know, the gov. can pass all sorts of laws. If the people and local police don't believe in it, and enforce it, those laws are meaningless..(remember prohibition in the US..?)\r\n\r\nI don't know Ms. Aziz's politics, but she does make one good point. I will like to hear what according to her, the gov. should do to protect women against atrocities. (Obviously continuing with the Hudood, indefinitely, is a very bad idea..)\r\n","link_id":"t3_tfgg","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165168904,"ups":4,"score":4,"author":"rocky_m","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctg3w","id":"ctgpk","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807644,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5169-8c0b1c4e-7d93-4ccc-9db8-5bd8c976ac46-1566236759"}

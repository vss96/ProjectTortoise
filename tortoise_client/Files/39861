They are the same kind of reasons that other researchers face, such as \"Why, Mr. Darwin, waste your time on those turtles in that little island?\", and \"Why, Mr. Fleming, that stupid fungus won't help anybody\", and the most important, \"Mr. Berners-Lee, people do not need a protocol to communicate: they have letters!\"\r\nThe moon is there is sufficient enough of an argument - that it might help to launch less expensive missions (since its escape velocity is less), that it might be helpful to microgravity manufacturing, that it might create a colonization post without natives to kill are all speculative answers. But it is there, and it is on our genes to go there, explore, know, try and try until we actually have that stupid base in the moon (Because it will be mostly under the surface).\r\nAnd also, because I would like to jump in 1/6 gee.","controversiality":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165951559,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"science","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25412-9443ab15-3617-46f5-ba0d-c15e916d9ab6-1566236767"}

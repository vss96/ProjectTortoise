Unfortunately, I don't have the option of switching from the \"pay taxes on everything\" to the \"pay for only what you use\" plan.  I would gladly give up almost all of the \"benefits\" I get from the government in exchange for the freedom to select only the useful things.  After all, if the government is really doing so much good, why do we have to be forced into paying for it, unlike when we go shopping at a grocery store?\r\n\r\nFor example, consider how disconnected public support of the war on terror is compared with the amount of money being spent on it.  Can you imagine how quickly the US would be out of Iraq if people weren't strong-armed into paying for it?\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the internet is advancing fantastically now, because anyone can start an ISP and make money off of it in myriad ways.  But what was it used for before commerce was allowed?  It was hindered because of AT&amp;T's government-granted monopoly on telephone lines.","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29662-249fccd6-a080-45b5-a3f4-4543cd13f08f-1566236769"}

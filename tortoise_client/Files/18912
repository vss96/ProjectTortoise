There might be some confusion between production and employment.   We have far fewer people in manufacturing than we did 20 years ago but our production capacity has been fairly stable.  Sure it hasn’t grown but we still produce an immense amount of stuff and only 9.2% of it is agricultural.  Most of our exports are capital goods (49.0%) which you don’t buy in a store so you don’t really see what American industry makes.  Capital goods are also going to be far more competitive as the dollar weakens.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164932372,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"55-b47ea54a-dbf2-410f-a88c-673a000ef286-1566236758"}

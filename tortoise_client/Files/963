Maybe a sophisticated, statically-typed and fast language (D? Ocaml? Haskell?) optimized for implementing interpreters aka domain specific languages is needed? Then the clever people could use this language to develop loads of (integrated!) DSLs for the programming drones.\r\n\r\nJava is getting more complicated and i think that is bad (for stupid programmers), but necessary (for some applications). We need simple, stupid DSLs for GUI, web apps, etc.\r\n\r\nLisp is very good to implement Lispy DSLs, but not good at hiding power and we need to hide it. Which other languages are good at things like reader macros?\r\n\r\nNote: By DSL i mean \"not Turing-complete\" like Makefiles, OCL or URL dispatcher. I [picked up this definition](http://stupidcoder.blogspot.com/2006/11/doubting-rails-dsls.html) some days ago and i like it.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6994-a4840f9c-c5ef-424a-9f59-07138aa2f17f-1566236760"}

Use about an ounce for flavour when you are making stir-fry.  Bones make good soup stock, and good for stew too (practically free in stores).  There's always vegetables that are going to go bad soon at the end of the day that they will sell off for cheap.  I'm talking major grocery stores.  Local grocers will almost give them away at the end of the day, since they will go bad anyways without refrigeration.  In Chinatown, they will sell bags of 12-20 apples, oranges, vegetables, for a dollar a bag.  Some are bruised and almost going bad, but if you refrigerate them promptly, can last a while longer.  Or you can blend them for juice.\r\n\r\nOnions and garlic are cheap.  You can buy a few bulbs to give more flavour to your food.  Spices are a bit more expensive, but will last you far longer than a month.\r\n\r\nYou do need oil and fat in your diet, or you will end up loading on carbs without feeling full.  Mom told me about living through a famine in 1959-60.  Just try to buy raw ingredients, don't shop at a large grocery chain, and try making larger portions of food that will last you several days.  My dad told me about neverending stew where you add a new ingredient every day to a large pot of stew (and more water) - the stew gets tastier every day as you reheat it and the flavours blend.","controversiality":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165043314,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2960-428e419f-d932-4414-a102-24d04092d401-1566236759"}

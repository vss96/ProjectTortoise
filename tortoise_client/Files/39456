Are you serriously suggesting less training and skill for police? Can you imagine a situation, probably common, where officers might be required know how to operate a vehicle manually considering the number of manuals on the road.  I don't know, maybe a situation say even at a DUI checkpoint.  Or simply just to move a car out of danger.  Aren't there a significant enough of arrests made from traffic stops that require this sort of thing be common knowledge for police officers?  It is sort of like this, even if an officer is trained to use and given a revolver, I sure hope that officer knows how an automatic pistol works or vice versa.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wgpl","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1167529275,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59445-04ff3157-5538-4f06-846f-ff5c5e3fdbb8-1566236780"}

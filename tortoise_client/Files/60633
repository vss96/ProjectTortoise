They're the ones that may counter press adultery charges, that hold the concept of a 'ruined woman' or otherwise treat a victim like a criminal.\r\n\r\nThe right to wear attention grabbing clothing is something women fought a long hard war of attrition for, and it's a use it or lose it freedom. That I may wear jeans took past generations of gutsy women the willingness to say @#$^ it, it's my body, my freedom and I'm not going to let fear of having some sort of theoretical purity destroyed stop me.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not what you wear, it’s how you stand out from the herd. If every girl is wearing typical teenage pop tart based attire except for one Pentecostal girl in Little House on the Prairie garb, guess who is most at risk for getting grabbed when she walks down the dark alley behind the high school? The same thing applies to male rapes. As a male you’re more likely to get attacked if you look vulnerable and different.\r\n\r\nAnd, what your genetics graced you with throw a wrench into the works anyway. If you’re gifted with a lot of junk in the trunk or a bust you can use as extra shelving space, these bits of you are gonna be impossible to conceal creep magnets. Ask any blessed young lady, and after she’s done slapping you she’ll agree with me.\r\n\r\nSo in theory, conforming would decrease my chance of violation. However in the long run if all girls conformed we’d do a disservice to those who can’t help looking different. A better defence is to make appearance so varied that everyone can do what they want because the range runs from bikini to chador and back again. :)","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w84v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57235-003acfd9-38e5-4575-9284-a60ea7b556c2-1566236779"}

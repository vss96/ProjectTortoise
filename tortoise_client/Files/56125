(Soft real-time is uninteresting to me in this app; it's mostly going to be network-bound anyhow, listening for responses.)\r\n\r\nThe string problem in Erlang seems nearly impossible to overcome without fundamental work on the language; you either store them as binary blobs at a high cost in manipulability, or you store them as a series of chars with bloats them beyond belief, and Unicode support in both cases is basically something you have to worry about. String processing in Erlang is actually worse than it is in C, IMHO. \r\n\r\nI've tapped into some of the libraries with the Erlang ports, but it sucks that I have to completely define a new protocol from scratch with every port. My attempts to wrap even trivial libraries into Erlang with the various helper libraries, and once a minimal library direct with just raw C, have all failed in a horrible mess of error messages that even after spending many hours with Erlang are still mostly incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nI like Erlang, I really do, I think that it's an extremely good candidate for where we're all going with concurrency, but right now too many things are just too fundamentally hard for me to be able to put my app in it. (Some of the fundamental hardness is stuff that can be fixed; some of it is zealously defended by the Erlang core so it probably won't go away, but if I even mention what I mean my experience on reddit suggests I'll get modded to oblivion.)","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u2ng","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16290-71adc81e-ad93-4e6a-b4d3-5f8459db598e-1566236763"}

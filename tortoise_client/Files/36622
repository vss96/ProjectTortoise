Well, as a member of the genetic research community, I can tell you that correlation is often the only place we can start.  You get a bunch of individuals (people, mice, plants, whatever) with a trait together, and you look for what parts of their genome they share.  Then you publish a paper saying you found the gene for whatever trait it was.  Actually figuring out how the gene causes the trait is a very different story.  Sometimes it's easy: this mutation knocks out that enzyme, causing some other thing to build up, resulting in a disease (e.g. phenylketonuria).  Other times we know the function of the gene in the cell, and we know what effect knocking it out will have on the phenotype, but we have no idea how the two are related (e.g. FOXP2 and language).  Other times, especially with more complex traits, we merely find a region of a chromosome that's associated with the trait, and we don't know what gene causes a disease, much less how (e.g. ~5 different chromosomes and autism).  However, that doesn't mean that it isn't worthwhile to publish.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166201193,"ups":3,"score":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30780-b4802e12-5d02-4561-bdbd-a6aada8fe23d-1566236769"}

There is a big problem for consumers who want to sue their health insurance companies. \r\n\r\nThere is a federal law, ERISA, that limits many consumers from suing their health insurance company for denial of benefits. Additionally, because of this law, consumers cannot pay their lawyer with a contingency fee. Thus, you must have many thousands of dollars and hire a lawyer on an hourly basis to fight such a lawsuit. \r\n\r\nAre there exceptions? Yes. Some. \r\n\r\nWhat should you do if you are personally caught up in this awful, terribly neglected, rotten area of the law? Act post-haste. Call lawyers in big cities who advertise that they work in insurance or ERISA law. Ask them about your case. If they can't help, ask for a referral to an ERISA lawyer. \r\n\r\nYou could ask your state insurance commissioner to look into your case. \r\n\r\nWe need to change this system because it's broken. People pay for health insurance, then get denied the benefits they are entitled to. \r\n\r\nI just came across Familes USA on the web. They are a group that says they fight for the interests of health insurance consumers. If we work together, we can fix the system.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.familiesusa.org/","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35329-8507ba6a-1bbc-4e71-bc8b-18e16f4e7efa-1566236771"}

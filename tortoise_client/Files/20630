But I can't think of a better way to illustrate the seriousness of fire safety.\r\n\r\nIn recent years there was commercial jet loaded with passengers that caught fire on the tarmac. It's case study in crowd successful management because the flight attendents understood how to get everyone out of the plane alive in less than 3 minutes. The key to their success was forcefully managing the traffic flow everywhere in aircraft especially near the exits. On the safety video they show us a kind flight attendent gently helping grandma onto the escape slide, but in a real emergency the well trained attendent knows that their job is to throw everyones ass out the door as hard and as fast as they can and repeat in rapid fire succession until the plane is empty. And that's just what they did: the burliest flight attendents manned the exits and grabbed anyone that came near the exit and threw them out.\r\n\r\nBy law, night clubs are now required to have at least one staffer trained in crowd management for every 250 patrons.\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807936,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctwcj","parent_id":"t3_ttys","author":"wearedevo","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12525-0f528419-a30d-4d66-acb1-a7ad7ed5b768-1566236762"}

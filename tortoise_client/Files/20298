The VHS-to-DVD upgrade offered a *very* big step up in terms of perceived picture quality, plus a grab bag of other goodies (cheap videos that don't wear out, random-access, special features, etc.) And yet DVD still didn't really take off until the players got awfully cheap.\r\n\r\nI was blown away by an HD demo -- a Space Shuttle take-off -- a few years ago at a high-end tv/stereo shop. But they had a colossal, unlimited-budget screen and sound system, expertly set up. I've seen football etc. via HD satellite in a friend's living room, and it's a much less compelling proposition. The HD picture is better, but is it kilodollars worth of better? Not to me.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w3m1","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":4,"score":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167242307,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53330-833e09ba-4a9d-4196-8f9e-419c146d3607-1566236778"}

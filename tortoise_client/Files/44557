Well, variable length is one of the reasons why condoms are sold rolled up. If a condom comes off, the problem isn't length (as the article seems to be stuck on), it's actually girth, which isn't mentioned anywhere! And if the problem is that the condom tears, that's because the condom is too small, not too big.","score":23,"ups":23,"created_utc":1165602566,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16581-b06eae0f-2f6e-4f5e-a844-a84c2029f090-1566236763"}

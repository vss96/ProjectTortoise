There is *NOTHING WRONG* with Christian summer camp, and the vile hatred which exists against Christians is *just plain wrong* and totally unwarranted. Instead of creating opinions for someone, instead of *assuming* someone was brainwashed, or had ideas PUSHED on them, why dont you go to the source? Most if not all of these kids I guarantee you are *already* church-going and Bible believing Christians, who are already very much against Abortion, etc. Just because a kid is against abortion does not mean they are brainwashed, and a hatred of those who believe ending *ANY* life is bad, is both unwarranted and uncalled for. It is unfair to judge someone by watching a third party documentary, and then to say \"Oh this is scary\" or \"Oh they are brainwashing these kids\" \r\n\r\n*edit note: This comment was written *before* I watched the whole of the \"Jesus Camp\" documentary.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165721985,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-21,"ups":-21,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19570-603f2a41-5f92-455e-a682-206fcfa2bf11-1566236764"}

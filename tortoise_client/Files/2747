Mormon scripture commands Joseph Smith to take \"hundreds\" of wives so he will be like the other great prophets and BE MORE LIKE GOD. God having a kingdom with many wives is fundamental Mormon scriptural and temple theology.\r\n\r\n2. The Book of Abraham says \"the GODS came down\" and created the earth. The great promise of the Mormon temple is that through the endowment you too can become a God. A plurality of Gods is fundamental Mormon doctrine.\r\n\r\n3. What ordained prophets and apostles teach from the pulpit  is inspired from God. These inspired teachings were published by the church and represent Mormon theology.\r\n\r\n4. Elohim coming to earth was part of the temple ceremony for decades. How could that have gotten in there if it was false doctrine?\r\n\r\n5. Many apostles and prophets, speaking as the Lord's anointed from the pulpit have taught that God did come down and impregnate Mary physically. \r\n\r\n6. The Mormon Church has also taught that Jesus has several wives. See:\r\nhttp://www.i4m.com/think/bible/mormon-jesus-married.htm\r\n\r\n7. The above page also cites church claims that Joseph Smith was a descendant of Jesus Christ, including current LDS scriptures in the Doctrine and Covenants.\r\n\r\n8. The church has taught many times that everyone born after Joseph Smith must have his permission to enter heaven. The church's priesthood manual says \"If we get our salvation, we shall have to pass by the Prophet Joseph Smith; if we enter our glory, it will be through the authority he has received. We cannot get around him.\" \r\n\r\nSee:\r\nhttp://www.i4m.com/think/history/mormon_christians.htm\r\n\r\nDo your homework.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165847196,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22287-763a0172-b56f-47de-b3cc-38fa65bb1fa3-1566236766"}

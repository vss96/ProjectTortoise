That is, make the client just a display platform with no processing ability.  \r\n\r\nI read that 75% of US internet connections are broadband based, if this figure is true then I think the market for feature rich GUI apps is there and we just need to make the killer app :-)\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that gaming, business and social apps are all working well so something new needs to tip the scales.\r\n\r\nApp hosting is one area that is ripe for explotation by a small lean company with focused staff.  The current offerings are expensive and in-flexable.\r\n\r\nSo what new apps could take advantage of this new/old paradigm?\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vc6c","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809052,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ajmoir","edited":false,"id":"cvjhk","parent_id":"t3_vc6c","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41714-cba70db6-36b7-4b59-b80b-ed538956dbed-1566236774"}

What is required is a simple (or apparently simple) interface to those features.  Apparently thats too deep a concept for this writer.\r\n\r\nOne ill-founded concept that I always hear from the anti-Apple folks is that OS X and Apple products in general are too simple.  They're obviously so much less _advanced_ than the alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe reality however is that the interface is deceptive.  They are as simple or advanced as you want them to be.  Thats exactly how it should be.\r\n\r\nHere's the truth:  People want an interface that is as smart as they are.  They don't want an interface thats smarter than them... and they don't want an interface thats too basic.  They want the interface to adapt to them.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u8mn","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19643-4e86a4fd-2dec-40e7-baa4-eafd27dd0b15-1566236764"}

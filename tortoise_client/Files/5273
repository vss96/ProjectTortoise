{"controversiality":1,"body":"kos discloses this stuff...it's not like he tries to hide the fact that he gets money from these folks. \r\n\r\nThe idea that DailyKOS is extremist liberal is just fiction. If you actually read the postings kos isn't more liberal than any mainstream democrat. He just actively works for his cause.  He supports moderate candidates, including some that are anti-choice or anti-gun control. If you read Crashing the Gate, he even speaks out against letting interest groups control the party. \r\n\r\nSome of the diarists and users may be extreme, but the organizer of the site certianly isn't. \r\n\r\nI find it interesting that this investigative report only included liberal sites.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tisk","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1165250463,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"ctkjn","parent_id":"t3_tisk","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807716,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6839-374f1b06-78cf-4992-8823-9a6520ffb661-1566236760"}

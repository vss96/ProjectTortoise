Upon age 18, they can invariably drive, vote, smoke, own and discharge firearms, perform citizen's arrests, fly airplanes, and die in wars, but they cannot drink alcohol.\r\n\r\nAs a teetotaller, that annoys me to no end. (Actually, the US laws don't annoy me that much, it's the similar laws here that do it). What signal does this send? That alcohol is the ultimate adult privilege. You actually have to be an Adult Plus to use it.\r\n\r\nI'm in favour of a line of 16 for every single right or privilege associated with adulthood. If you're old enough to have sex, you're old enough to marry. If you're old enough to land in jail or serve in the army, then you're old enough to vote. The reason being that these lines are arbitrary anyway, and it's hypocritical to pretend otherwise.","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1165496918,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13643-16f718b9-98e4-4280-90bf-7fff23ee0d04-1566236762"}

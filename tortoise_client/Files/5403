{"controversiality":0,"body":"Why is he comparing JSON to SOAP?  They're not even remotely the same domain.  JSON is an encoding format used by AJAX applications (although I suppose it should be AJAJ, since the X is for XML), SOAP is an encoding and transport format for RPC style requests between different domains.  Granted, you could use JSON and HTTP as a replacement for SOAP, and since most languages have libraries for it, it could be a desirable alternative (based on its simplicity).  However, that was not what it was designed for.\r\n\r\nHaving spent the last few months working on a large SOAP application, I can say with certainty that the people who designed SOAP were completely insane.  Simple it is not.  And don't even get me started on the mess that is WSDL.\r\n\r\nOh, and Javascript's abilities to parse XML are frustratingly limited.  I wrote a recursive function to parse XML into a javascript associative array so the data would be manageable, but it took way more time and code than just doing 'var stuff = eval(jsonString);'.","link_id":"t3_vm0n","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166733551,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jimbobhickville","parent_id":"t3_vm0n","edited":false,"id":"cvodl","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809148,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44153-628c9b69-86a7-4da1-b461-c82605708b8c-1566236774"}

This is something I do not advocate, however. It might be counter-intuitive, but trying to plop the problem into a cost/benefit equation dehumanizes us, and even the killer... the victim too, by extension.\r\n\r\nBut just because I don't go for the most \"efficient\" (imagine a german accent with that word, if you like) option, doesn't mean we should go with the worst. Which is to assume that this kid is in any way redeemable or salvageable. He isn't. A 1 out of 1000 or even 1 out of 100 rate of rehabilitation is simply not high enough to risk another person's life over. Perhaps sometime in the future when we are better able to identify those that can be, this will change, though even then I would worry. But for now, keep him locked up.\r\n\r\nAnyone that thinks it's a waste of money to put steel bars between yourself and murderers lives in la-la land.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_trhc","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165371555,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10497-6c906105-6a1b-44c4-b515-1005ec1c9215-1566236761"}

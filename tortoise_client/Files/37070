Even the Pascal's Wager argument is a little bit irrelevant, because if pain is just sensations in the brain (seemingly likely, given current neuroscience), and you don't have a functioning brain after death, it'll be pretty tough for God to give you a life of eternal torment without bringing you back to some semblance of life.  \r\n\r\nI care about rigorous standards of argumentation.  The fact that she asked a stupid question does not give him a right to give her a stupid answer.  If he can't answer the question (and it's really not a question that can be answered well), then *say so*.  Acknowledge that there's a possibility that he's wrong.  That's really one of the great strengths of science - acknowledging that a theory may be wrong is the first step to making it right.\r\n\r\nSomehow, I doubt that Dawkins response convinced anyone there.  That's fine for masturbatory atheists, but really, *what's the point*?  Why spend all that effort lecturing to people who won't believe a word you say anyway?","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166371189,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33929-333ec6c3-3f13-43c3-9259-081120794adc-1566236771"}

The last couple of paragraphs just killed the story for me. I mean, he had to HINT at the Wal-Mart people to make them realise it was his work? It doesn't work like that. The security cameras are there for a reason. I'm surprised he even carried it off as smoothly as he said he did. So the people he used to work with in Wal-Mart were on the holiday and not there when he set up the computers, but how does he explain how he still managed to pull off such an elaborate prank without being noticed. The biggest factor that blows this story apart - security cameras. I'm sure Wal-Mart wasn't too happy with someone displaying hardcore porn on their computer displays and upholding the fake price announced by the author at one of the busiest times of the year. Sorry, but it's not revenge if it never happened.","link_id":"t3_w94g","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56385-f574ce7e-e8f6-4992-8c27-4d4ad843d5d8-1566236779"}

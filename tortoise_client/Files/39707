PHP certainly isn't the most sophisticated language, but it's simple, extremely well documented, and very, very available\r\n\r\nIn fact, the lack of sophistication could be seen as an advantage; creating something functional with PHP doesn't require an understanding of funky sounding concepts like closures or continuations or S-Expressions or any of those other fancy-sounding terms the other languages are throwing around.\r\n\r\nI'm squarely in the Ruby and C camp, but I can certainly see the appeal of PHP.  Not everyone needs a rocket-powered sports car to go grocery shopping; sometimes the rusty minivan with a bad muffler and squeaky brakes does the job just as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think that at some point PHP use (in the traditional sense, anyway) will begin to wane as it is replaced by two sets of tools: MVC frameworks for programmers and web-developers (Struts, Rails, Django, CakePHP, etc), and template-driven page builders for end users (Yahoo Page Builder, Wordpress templates, etc).","controversiality":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165886915,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cuif7","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuhy0","author_flair_text":null,"author":"pabs","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808352,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23784-f7c350dc-85c3-4789-a702-e28764613c42-1566236767"}

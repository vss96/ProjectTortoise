And no one has, or needs, a definition of a pile of evil, which is exactly what you were demanding.\r\n\r\nSlippery slope is a fine argument to use to expose people who don't care about children being exploited, about slavery, about murder or about anything else. You think these people don't exist but they do. Hopper is an example of such a sick fuck who just *doesn't care* unless someone forces him to.\r\n\r\n&gt; could turn on its head and claim that any leveraging of advantage over a weaker party is wrong.\r\n\r\nDo you know why you didn't produce a slippery slope argument instead of this handwaving crap about how \"someone could\" make such an argument? Because you can't make one. Because human rights theory regulates moral claims and no argument you could make would or ever could stand up to it.","link_id":"t3_t66j","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807469,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"richardkulisz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct7g9","id":"ct7gg","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"881-d2caa997-daaf-40b0-b5d4-2bde941717bb-1566236758"}

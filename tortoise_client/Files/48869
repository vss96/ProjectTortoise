You barely even have to specify your types, as the compiler infers them.  It also has good unicode support.  I wager given a week you'd at least grow to appreciate it as a superior language (yet perhaps not yet practical for web purposes).  Then again, if you've been programming procedural for 34 years, that's a giant paradigm leap.  Would probably take a few months.\r\n\r\nSo, I suppose in that position PHP is a valid choice as favorite.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t3xg","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807469,"author":"mgsloan","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ct7g1","parent_id":"t1_ct6zn","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"872-20071100-1e59-4786-b69d-d4a96a55b8f0-1566236758"}

Zakāt (Arabic: زكاة‎) is the Islamic concept of [tithing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe) and [alms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alms).\r\n\r\n2. The payment of zakât is obligatory on all Muslims\r\n\r\n3. Zakāt – classical Arabic: زكوة; modern Arabic: زكاة; Turkish: Zekât; also transliterated zakaat or zakah; \"to grow\" (in goodness), \"increase,\" \"purifying,\" \"making pure\".\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n***In this case*** (Saudi money going to Iraqi Sunnis), it is, primarily, the clerics at Saudi mosques who are to blame and not (all) the people who give/pay Zaqat at those mosques. \r\n\r\nAlso, Sunnis are a minority (relatively) in Iraq and Shias (who are the majority) are apparently being funded by Iran, making this issue a little more complex.. US and the Iraqi government needs to talk to Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia and  use their help to get these communities to stop fighting and enter negotiations..\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nA similar situation was discovered a few years back when donations by American-Hindus to some Indian \"Aid\"/charity organizations were channeled to Hindu extremist groups in the Indian state of Gujarat [(during the Hindu-Muslim riots after  \"Godhra Incident\"/\"Gujarat Genocide\" of 2002) (link)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_violence)\r\n\r\n(references to US-Hindus (inadvertently ?) funding violence, more links to come )\r\n\r\n1.

Text markup, in general, is a balance between the conflicting forces of conciseness (Do-What-I-Mean), expressiveness (Do-What-I-Say), and, in the case of web-visible text, safety (ZOMG-[XSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xss)-OH-NOES).   \r\n\r\nAt one end of the spectrum is plain, don't-fuck-with-it, text.  Usenet and e-mail seem content with it, though html e-mail is ubiquitous nowadays.  Towards the other end is html and its family of markup languages.  More verbose, but you can express things with more precision and flexibility (as evidenced by the variety of browsers, big-and-small, text-or-graphic-or-screen-reader-based, etc.).  I'm quite sure there are even more expressive systems beyond that of which I'm not aware.\r\n\r\nI find the mostly-do-what-I-mean markups, like [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) or [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (which reddit uses), to be a good compromise.  Unfortunately, the matter of safety insists that one put further escaping measures around web-user-originated text, sometimes resulting in [undesirable interactions](http://features.reddit.com/goto?id=tizw).  The problem is non-trivial.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165224859,"score":9,"ups":9,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6259-653f2b08-c4aa-4ec3-b3d2-9b80f334a198-1566236760"}

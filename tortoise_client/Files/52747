Most Japanese people take KanKen when they are kids. It's a standardizzed test set up by one corporation to induce kids to go to juku and study more, and passing it has no real meaning other then to prove to your parents that you are learning something. It includes a lot of questions about stroke order, names of radicals, and stuff like that which you would never encounter in your daily life. In other words, you have to study specifically for the test in order to pass it. As such, asking adults to take it is kindof pointless as they've already had ten years to forget all the nitpicky details their juku teachers made them study when they were trying to get into high school.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809391,"gilded":0,"id":"cw19m","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vzzg","author_flair_text":null,"author":"donkeymon","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50751-5a6fd6f4-4d9f-4ff9-9257-bf2257959381-1566236778"}

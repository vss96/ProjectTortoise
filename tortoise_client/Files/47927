It was reported (in a small article deep in the paper) the next day without his name.\r\n\r\nIt was really a sad thing. He was a great person. I see there are people here \"agreeing with the suit.\" It is obviously very traumatic for people who witness this type of thing.\r\n\r\nHowever, suicide is often the case of a temporary insanity, sort of like a \"mental heartattack.\" If the person can get past it they can be healthy productive members of society. They are not necessarily deadbeats thoughtlessly trying to ruin your day.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't blame a kid who has seizures for ruining your kid's experience at the local pool, and you probably wouldn't rant at a man who had a heart attack and lost control of his bowels on the subway train you were on because it scared you and grossed you out. So please be cautious in throwing out anger at someone who is attempting suicide, it is overwhelmingly likely due to mental illness.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1959-342697a9-cd4e-4a66-9ab2-b99266c23dec-1566236758"}

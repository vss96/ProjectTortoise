Level n people were kind enough to say \"taste is subjective\" instead of saying \"grow better ears\".\r\n\r\nOf course, it was very easy for n-5 people to derail \"taste is subjective\" into, well, subjectivity.\r\n\r\nOne very nice definition of beauty: \"Beauty is truth reflected in the mirror of creation\" - interesting because it applies to both natural and artificial beauty.

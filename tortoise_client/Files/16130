Second, there is a medical benefit to circumcision. Third, procedures that are only unnecessary or unwanted can not be remotely considered unethical or criminal. Unless you think that cosmetic surgery is criminal. Personally, I'd like to see fewer boob jobs, but that's just me. As far as \"unwanted\" goes, it's not so much unwanted as un-asked for- you can conduct a poll though to find out how many circumcised adults feel violated, I'm guessing the number is small. Fourth, any lawyer or judge will tell you that while a baby is too young to make medical decisions for itself, the parent controls the decision making process, and any baby will tell you that... well, a baby's not telling you anything, because NO baby can consent to anything, so it's really a moot point. If I decide to circumcise your baby for you, then yes, you have an argument, but if your parents decide to circumcise you, it's completely within their rights, so you really don't have much to stand on as far as \"criminal\" goes. Personally, I don't know the religious history behind circumcision, but if Jews have been cutting off their foreskin for thousands of years, I'm really not going to try and stop them. Why would you want to? Are you really so upset about what other people are doing to their penises?","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166415836,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"science","id":"cv6aa","parent_id":"t1_cv4e9","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"carpeliam","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808798,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35115-2cc44993-be68-48c3-a43b-36df90f1ce8e-1566236771"}

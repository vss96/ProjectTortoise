I can quite easily believe that it's the \"culture surrounding the language\" that's \"not compatible with the outside world.\" The language itself doesn't appear to be particularly incompatible with the world the rest of live in at all.\r\n\r\nI said that it could be seen that way, not that it was necessarily true. It is an accepted factor of Lisp development that pretty much the entire system is mutable at runtime. Most languages do not do this. Maybe it is Lisp's culture that has this behavior, maybe that it is available in the language evokes this behavior in the culture. \r\n\r\nEither way, Lisp itself is different from most of the rest of the world in this respect, and that difference can create significant incompatibilities.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165432382,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12079-546b5367-58b2-4229-b5d9-15511809e3fc-1566236761"}

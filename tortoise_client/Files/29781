{"controversiality":0,"body":"Those first two things are offered by another Google service, [Google Pages](http://pages.google.com), which complements Gmail quite well. The third and fourth features, I'm supposing, are just too hard to scale to the number of users Gmail serves (imagine running custom-scripted sieves for 10 million messages per day (I can guarantee this statistic to be 88.5% made up)). The fifth *is implemented in Gmail*; it came along with the backwarding (as opposed to forwarding, oho) feature.\r\n\r\nThe sixth, I have no idea about. Firefox with Adblock Plus has left me unaware of the relative annoyance of web applications. I only found out Reddit has an ad to the right of the comments section yesterday.\r\n\r\nAs for tech support, you're probably right there. No Google CS worth their wage would be sitting at a helpdesk; you'd have to get an entirely different corporate atmosphere to encourage *that*.","link_id":"t3_uctp","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165817753,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"derefr","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuefn","parent_id":"t1_cue9m","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808275,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21676-656ff061-f6bc-4f0f-af7c-1cbf199f2894-1566236765"}

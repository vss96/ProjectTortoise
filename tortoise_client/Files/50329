If people are sending credit card numbers without ssl, then I dont think they need wifi to get that info.\r\n\r\nThere's a number of ways they could do this. SSL is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. A certificate warning will pop up, but people click 'OK' without reading those anyways.\r\n\r\nThey also could just set up a rouge access point with a wifi login screen that mimics whatever business they are at. Some of these places require you to enter your credit card number for internet access.\r\n\r\nedit: it appears both of these methods were already mentioned. sorry. :P","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807919,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctvhb","parent_id":"t1_ctuph","author":"elusive","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12097-a75654c9-8db7-4705-8f13-94811b38ad3f-1566236761"}

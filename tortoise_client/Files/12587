Showed up at a genius bar with no appointment, waited about an hour.  He confirmed that it wouldn't charge, tried a couple of the PROM resetting tricks, etc, and then decided to ship the laptop out for repairs.  I got it back 4 days later, good as new.  They even replaced the rubber feet that had fallen off of the bottom of the laptop.\r\n\r\nMy last encounter with Dell tech support was pretty awful. Brand new desktop was randomly resetting every 5 minutes or so. This was a couple of months after they started the India call centers, and the person I talked to knew nothing and apparently didn't know how to connect me to a supervisor or at least somebody who knew what they were doing.  This is a reasonably complex problem, but as far as Dell is concerned, there are only two ways it can go: either the customer's power is shitty, or the computer is bad in some way (in which way it is bad does not concern the customer).  It took 8 hours on the phone and a half-dozen callbacks for them to agree to ship a new computer out.  An awful experience, and I will never buy Dell again.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56903-d250cb36-6740-44d5-b5f1-3b8539735a5c-1566236779"}

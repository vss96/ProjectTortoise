File access and OS integration in particular are terrible -- a dozen similar names for the same functions across a dozen different implementations.\r\n\r\nThe Common Lisp standard as a whole needs to be modernized, cleaned up, and modularized.  It was originally cobbled together from the common bits of the leading commercial Lisps, and so has its idiosyncracies.  For instance, it includes several powerful math functions that in any other language would be within a library/module, but instead are functions built into the language.  A more modern library would make the language much more comfortable to use, IMO.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w4aj","subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1167286532,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54462-c447c67d-164d-4c5d-8d11-2dbac2ceb0df-1566236779"}

{"body":"Twilight Princes does feel like it uses wii controls as an afterthought however, that being said...\r\n\r\n\"Rayman\" uses the wii controller in great ways (I am very keen on the pig rescuing missions), \"Super Monkey Ball\" uses the tilt sensors of the wii remote with great success (I own the game and I can attest to it), \"Trauma Center\" uses the the pixel precision positioning with great accuracy and many people heap praise on the \"Excite Truck\" controls but I only heard it second hand so I can't vouch personally. The \"Super Swing Golf Pangya\" uses the wii remote to give the player semi-realistic golf swing. I rented it and it was quite fun and felt accurate (perhaps too accurate for me). Golf's not my thing so I didn't end up buying it but I if you're into golf simulations no other console can touch wii when it comes to golf sims and \"Super Swing\" is the living proof. Obviously there is also the \"Wii Sports\" package which shows off just the rudimentary applications of the wii controllers (mostly accelerometers).\r\n\r\nI bet we'll see a lot of interesting applications of the wii remote in the future. I hope to see a more accurate and tougher implementation of tennis, Tiger Woods golf, decent boxing sim (though I think it will be better with two wiimotes than with a nunchuck as the nunchuck has accelerometers only), a variety of FPS titles using the wiimote as  a gun, a flight sim that uses the wiimote as a yoke and hopefully a sword fighting game or a mini game done right (the current attempts have been lame but not because of the wiimote). We can safely say that developers are already starting to get comfortable with the features of the wiimote and it will only get better with time. Once game studios' developers start building nice high level libraries to handle the wii controllers I expect a lot of great stuff coming to the wii. These first titles are merely baby steps for them and their experience will grow with time.\r\n\r\nI think it is a great time to be a wii owner :-)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w37e","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":12,"ups":12,"created_utc":1167206719,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"grzelakc","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw4np","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw4kg","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809455,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52573-ecd16cb7-745c-47aa-ad20-cf2dc4c422b1-1566236778"}

Of course hardened armed robbers etc will still use them but the average petty criminal won't.  That's the British experience anyway.\r\n\r\n&gt; And finally, if you look at the crime statistics on the site you linked to, you will find that crime is way up overall in the UK in the years following the 1997 handgun ban -- almost double, in fact.\r\n\r\nYes I'm sure that's true but I don't think the two are related.  Britain also has an increasingly widespread drugs problem which brings with it greater use of firearms.  That ban only covered guns which were used in shooting clubs anyway, as far as I know.  Handguns have always been banned here but pre 1997 you could keep one at home if you were a signed up member of such a club.\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808215,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuakg","id":"cub9j","edited":false,"author":"muttleee","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19914-1fec2e1f-98d5-4fe0-8eff-0562a7cd1688-1566236764"}

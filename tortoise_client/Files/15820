I think a Chinese person could do it easily by buying only raw ingredients.  Shop Chinatown, bag of rice is $10 and would last a person more than 1 month.  Often a huge bag of vegetables is discounted to a dollar (5lb bag of string beans, near closing time).  Fish heads and bones for soup, pork bones (with some meat still hanging on), for protein.  You can easily make lots of \"chou\" (rice gruel) to fill you up, it's standard Chinese breakfast/lunch food.\r\n\r\nEthiopians and other mediterranian/arab peoples eat couscous with sauce/vegetable puree almost every day of the year.\r\n\r\nGreat experiment, and I'm sure you learned a lot, but many immigrant families live like this for years.  Part of the problem with hunger and reliance on food banks is lack of skill to make food.  My parents were poor immigrants 30 years ago, with neither time nor money, but they still raised a family on very little.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t9us","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165009743,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":45,"ups":45,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2214-66ae9ecf-d6f2-49c0-86d2-f87470884906-1566236758"}

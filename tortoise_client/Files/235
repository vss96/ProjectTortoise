They then gain money and power in the limited domain of their product/service category, and generally not much further. So - power is only gained by providing something useful to society, and once gained it it usually limited to the area of one's expertise.\r\n\r\nPower in a free market is also quickly lost with abuse or mistakes. New competitors spring up to take advantage of any mistakes, high prices, etc. Boycotts of companies can and do have huge effects on companies, so it is fairly easy for consumers to have an effect on companies through the free market, as well - far, far more (in my opinion) than our 'democracy' allows through voting.\r\n\r\nSo - again, I agree completely that in politics, power centers are very bad and should be avoided. I guess we disagree on the extent that free markets inherently discourage (long term) centers of power that can be destructive to society.\r\n\r\nEdit: added the last few paragraph for clarification.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808243,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cucnj","edited":false,"id":"cucry","author":"NoFixedAbode","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20698-971c058f-9a5b-4cf3-bb06-6dd9e770ea8e-1566236765"}

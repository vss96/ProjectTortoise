The carry-on x-ray units do NOT expose anything to more than 1 mR and this exposure will not damage film at all, nor cause any problem with any item going through the unit, including a baby. The check x-ray scanner can result in an exposure between 150 and 300 mR, depending on how the item is placed in the machine, angle, etc.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vhag","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809418,"distinguished":null,"author":"scientist","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw2pp","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvkjf","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51443-256c2d9a-378c-4f80-a41b-52fef3b2b20d-1566236778"}

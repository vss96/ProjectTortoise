Once enabled, this feature acts as virtual answering machine that holds your incoming calls. In other words, when you receive a call, by opening the flip you get an option to answer the call or delay it. The delay option automatically activates a women’s voice saying to the caller: Please hold, your call will be answered in a moment.","link_id":"t3_uj5x","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24166-bd9d9785-8890-4685-8438-ecff731c2060-1566236767"}

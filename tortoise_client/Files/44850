Sounds kind of like a very naive approach, if you ask me.\r\n\r\nIMHO, error handling cannot be included inside a project too early, and should be part of the design process (how will you provide feedback about errors? what levels of errors will you have? etc) ..\r\n\r\nWhen you implement a function, you typically know what might go wrong. If you don't handle any errors that can occur right then, chances are that you will forget about them later. Chances are just too likely that some errors will occur in the future.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1167585066,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"joel","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60309-89c5d96a-0e02-4495-a1c7-d4b374e232d7-1566236780"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"only tangentially related, i offer advice about options from a decade vet of another companY! in this space that went through a substantial bubble:\r\n\r\n- do not get obsessed with exercise-and-hold, its only smart when the stock is going up. otherwise it can turn into a tax nightmare that can bury you. i watched many people get gutted by this. and no, the irs has no mercy.\r\n\r\n- if the price seems amazing to you, sell. do not look a gift horse in the mouth and do not get hung up on the fact that next week you might have been able to get $10 a share. no one can pick the top.\r\n\r\n- set aside 50% proceeds for taxes and do not touch it or invest it in anything that can lose money. \r\n\r\n- do not tell anyone about your money if you can help it.\r\n\r\n- you have been given a one-time gift. do not confuse this with recurring regular income. i have watched many people get in over their heads, unable to stay afloat after the options have been cashed out.\r\n\r\n- as a follow up to the above, do not get too excited about buying that mansion. a $3 million house will cost you $30k a year in property taxes. this year thats funny money - in five years it might not be. do not bet on stock options paying the property tax every year! if you cannot pay the property taxes out of your regular after-tax income, you may be looking at too much house. \r\n\r\n- avoid high-priced investment advisors. \"private client services\" has got to be one of the biggest scams in the financial industry. tech kids love it because you get to have an older accountant in a suit grovel to you, or maybe a hot woman investment banker who will be playfully flirty with you. meanwhile they are charging you $1000 a month to give you the same performance you could get from SPY or DIA. the idea that \"private client\" services deliver higher returns is complete horseshit, but if you think $1000 a month is worth it to have a hot receptionist bring you coffee and pander to you while you are wearing your threadless t and new balance sneakers, rock on.\r\n\r\nall of this advice if basically what you would tell anyone who won the lottery, which you more or less have","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_unas","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166041764,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":13,"ups":13,"author":"skyskraper","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuoxk","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_unas","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808473,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26820-dd18fb69-7e52-4ca0-a858-53343eccb2c2-1566236768"}

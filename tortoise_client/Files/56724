I like this sort of conversation, because I can actually learn something from it.\r\n\r\n[This was what I meant](http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/7127/scr00438oj8.png), and [this is probably what you meant](http://img83.imageshack.us/img83/1446/scr00437iz5.png).\r\n\r\nNotice how I have my home folder in C:\\Users\\Alpha, and my Pictures folder in B:\\Pictures, which is actually on a network drive located on another machine. Windows has been natively supporting both features since 2000 (though the latter is only available with NTFS drives). Before that I had to make shortcuts, which, admitted, could be a nightmare for maintenance.\r\n\r\nI like many things in the LFS layout, such as how everything has been well-seperated consistently for decades, but that leads to another annoyance (at least to me) as well: why is it that they have to call user 'usr', and temp 'tmp', while 'home', 'root' and 'boot' can have their 4-letter luxery? While is it that most distros name stuff in users' home folder in properly Capitalized English, while almost everything else is in lowercase txtspk?? And why is there a folder called etc? Is that where you stuff 'everything else' in? And you call that hierachy!? (Yeah I know /etc is for config files, but why wasn't it named so?) Had these things been changed, older applications would break as well!\r\n\r\nWindows is unarguably inferior when it comes to system backups, but many of your concerns are outdated. User data is now technically seperated from system data (as it has been for over 6 years), but there are a lot of legacy applications out there whose programmer would not bother to follow convention (remember that Windows has a much wider developer base, and thus of lower quality on the average as well). Registry is one hell of a nightmare, and Microsoft realizes its mistake, but breaking 70% of existing software when releasing a new version of an OS is simply not acceptable.\r\n\r\nI tried to state Windows' FS layout in one sentence because I only wanted to show how predictable it is. That in no way implies it cannot achieve anything. Many things is simply a matter of taste as well: capitalization, use of spaces, seperated temp folder for each user, etc. If there's any inconsistency in your filesystem, it's most likely the software vendors you need to blame.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"812-801d3f77-b323-465c-b6cd-03ffef6ac53c-1566236758"}

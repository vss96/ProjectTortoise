I've taken a semester of college-level calculus, hold an internship with the local ACLU, and will present an (I think...) entirely new operating system feature next week.  I'm taking chemistry and physics at community college Spring semester.\r\n\r\nHowever, I lack knowledge of The Classics because I read more novels and modern writing than Old Human-Condition Stuff.  I've only done a few biology labs because most labs in textbooks and online require a real laboratory, and often materials prepared for the student by their school (ie: bacterial cultures), to perform.  And those chemistry and physics courses?  High-school level, because college Chemistry apparently requires high-school and the calculus-based physics class was all filled up.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'd say homeschoolers (and especially self-directed ones like unschoolers) tend to have very uneven educations.  We'll excell at some things and be merely average or even below average at others.\r\n\r\nI sent off my applications to three pretty good colleges yesterday (others go out after winter vacation), but I don't know what will happen.  You can never really know when you're a homeschooler.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809489,"gilded":0,"id":"cw6c6","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w4pi","author":"EliGottlieb","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53467-c936b1fa-917b-4ac0-a0ee-e99f4289ff3f-1566236778"}

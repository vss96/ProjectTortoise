To the rest of us deafness is an easily defined physical handicap and the reason the deaf community does not consider it to be a handicap is that this particular item defines their community.\r\n\r\nIf you want to consider the interesting consequences (which I can assure you will soon be played out in a court somewhere in this country) then ask yourself what will happen when the price and risks associated with the surgery drop and the deaf parents of a deaf newborn opt not to consider the surgery *because they want the child to be a part of their \"culture\"*.  Will the courts step in and declare a medical guardian for the child to determine if the surgery should be performed?  (The research noted in the article shows that the greatest benefit is to those who receive the implant by the time they are 1 year old, so there is a timeliness component to such a case that would make appointing such a medical guardian justifiable according to current practice.)","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2477-df17076b-b265-4eff-9817-68fb1fa3e103-1566236758"}

{"body":"That is simply not true.\r\n\r\nAnd just to be sure, its  burn to CD and rip. There is no subsequent \"record the ripped songs\" step. The \"songs will play very slow\" comment is puzzling indeed. I would love to hear the theory behind that...\r\n\r\nThere is no loss going to the CD if you choose AIFF. The AIFF CD will be exactly what would be presented  to the DAC (digital to analog converter) before being sent the amplifier/speaker/headphones/what-have-you.\r\n\r\nRipping that CD to MP3 would incure some degradation that some people can hear, but most would not. Rip it with a lossless encoder and you haven't lost anything from the original download.\r\n\r\nEither way, the quality is still far above what most people find acceptable and listen to every day.  There is no static or percieved distortion. Audio purists know the jargon (I don't) and might describe a \"loss of transparency\" or \"a confused sound stage\".","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_ujny","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165971876,"score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rkm000","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cum8l","id":"cun8b","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808440,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26084-74828861-bfc9-48c3-b216-2a118bc29d91-1566236767"}

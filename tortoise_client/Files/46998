But there's a big, practical difference between what some leader said and what's \"official.\"  If it isn't in the Bible, Book of Mormon, D&amp;C or Pearl of Great Price or the General Handbook of Instructions, then it isn't \"official.\"\r\n\r\nConsequently Mormon theology is very slippery.  It evolves.  And according to its own beliefs, it should.  It's a \"living\" religion with real-time revelation so doctrine can change.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165812683,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21550-de9e990c-d8ae-4135-9d5e-3e299b23d9d2-1566236765"}

That's about like saying that you know what it's like to be a world champion boxer because you've played Mike Tyson's Punch-Out.  I guess maybe you think you're a pretty good shot with a rifle based on having played Counterstrike, too.\r\n\r\nI can tell you from experience that there's a distinct difference even between having paintballs flying over your head and Counterstrike, and also between having paintballs flying over your head and having bullets flying over your head.  The difference between Counterstrike and live fire is probably something like the difference between stubbing your toe and having your leg sawed off without anesthetic.\r\n\r\n(edit: Have you ever even touched a real gun?)\r\n\r\n&gt; Brilliant observation, Retard-O 9000.\r\n\r\nOh, dear, I'm afraid you've trumped my arguments with that unassailable logic.  Go back to playing Counterstrike.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32958-b33ad9e4-8c0f-4851-a430-74b062de0dfe-1566236770"}

It's a blessing, because all the poor (metaphorically, of course - the bastards are making too much money for the description to be valid) C++ programmers can get work done a bit easier than they could before with a language that's still fairly familiar.\r\n\r\nIt's a curse because there are a lot of non-C++ programmers who could rattle off the names of a half-dozen languages that suck even less than Java. The widespread success of Java makes us cranky, and we bitch about it every chance we get.\r\n\r\nStill, I happen to think the JVM is very nifty, and I've been quite pleased with all the languages created or ported in the last few years to run on the JVM.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vh74","subreddit":"programming","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1166642400,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41512-657f53b0-9166-4296-9433-e9e5e8403ece-1566236773"}

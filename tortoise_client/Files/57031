{"body":"That's what is wrong with bodies like Amnesty. They victimize everything and with that move lose even the battles that have some merit and might have been won. The moment they become something that has some power they begin to overuse it. They turn into collective of zombies that emote a 'better mother earth'. That's why I can never sign anything involved with Greenpeace, Amnesty,... you name it. They just make me feel ill and disgusted by their hypocrisy.","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_v7fq","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166505546,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvbcv","parent_id":"t3_v7fq","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808894,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37613-f66f17d2-e605-4d95-9af1-1c9fa24bfdd2-1566236772"}

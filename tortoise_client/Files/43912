The flip side of \"would you shoot a man in order to steal his property?\" is \"would you shoot a man in order to enforce what you claim as your property?\" How did a libertarian's property come to exist? Did they make consensual agreements with everyone in the world to recognize their claims to ownership, or did they acquiesce to a history of deals with someone who, down the line, said- this is mine, and I'll kill anyone who tries to take it from me?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that libertarians aren't interested so much in a world free from coercion, which would perhaps require a substantial collective effort towards the common good, so much as a psychological basis for embracing their resort to force with as little troubled conscience as they can manage.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u9xr","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808198,"author":"guidoreichstadter","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuacx","parent_id":"t3_u9xr","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19429-0541582c-95ed-4ab9-bcb4-025b2ef663c3-1566236764"}

You can find examples of this played out not only in the food markets, but in communication, automotive, housing, and medical fields.\r\n\r\nLarge companies find it easier and cheaper to get laws passed that hinder smaller companies instead of innovating or lowering prices. The fact that we allow our government to   pass laws preventing free trade makes these kind of business tactics inevitable. You can point your finger at these big companies for doing this, but it is government that makes it an attractive and profitable business strategy.\r\n\r\nSo when you're reading this, keep in mind that this is not a single isolated case in the dairy industry but an inevitable, common, and insanely expensive and damaging result of government regulation of the free market.","link_id":"t3_ubuw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808235,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoFixedAbode","edited":false,"id":"cucc4","parent_id":"t3_ubuw","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20430-37f0344e-1f55-4514-9781-22da3caa8a92-1566236765"}

That's the only reason this article's reached the front page :)\r\n\r\nAs  for what derefr said further up about deleting emails...there are some I would prefer to have, which people specifically sent me, then there are form emails generated by various things, web purchases, forum registration and such, then there's spam. Some gets through the filters on Gmail, at least for me. Not much, but some. I don't want that shit. I don't open it, I don't read it, and I don't want it.\r\n\r\nYeah, in a perfect world, I suppose, it would be ideal to record *every* action for personal reference, and as long as we can do that for email, why not? But I don't even want a situation to arise where I'm expected to have spam emails or any other email I don't want, still recorded and archived, somewhere.\r\n\r\nI shouldn't have any responsibility to keep any emails that have nothing to do with me, so I jettison whatever I can.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uctp","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808293,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"malapropist","parent_id":"t1_cueez","id":"cufem","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22162-eb788d32-0247-42bf-9a71-14b28a925d62-1566236766"}

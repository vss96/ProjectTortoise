{"body":"I agree with your first two statements.  No American should be allowed to be a mercenary.\r\n\r\nBut I disagree with our final statement. American solidiers (overseas) *are* mercenaries. This is because they are no longer fighting for our \"country\" as oft supposed.  If this were actually **true**, then no, they would not be mercenaries.\r\n\r\nAmerican soldiers that are in **America** and stay in America are probably not mercenaries.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason the United States is the largest arms exporter in the world. You can't have a gigantic military deployed in 140+ countries unless you create an enemy to justify it.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vg01","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166631415,"author":"lifeofliberty","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvi3l","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvgpt","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809024,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41018-d3aa0de1-dd2d-4a2a-b90f-423df4227159-1566236773"}

I don't think that it had much to do with the technical merits of the systems.\r\n\r\nThe only real technical advantage the Playstation offered was the storage space of a CD-ROM vs a cartridge. The Nintendo 64 was built for 3D games - Mario, Zelda, Goldeneye, Starfox. The Playstation was only a 32 bit system and could never have matched the kind of graphics in the aforementioned games, but the massive size of the CD did allow for games like Final Fantasy VII and Resident Evil (which made heavy use of bitmaps) that would have been impossible on the N64.\r\n\r\nIn any case, all that is just quibbling, the main point being that hardware has little to do with winning the console wars.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vtff","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167016605,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":3,"score":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49341-1b8b2f72-7425-406f-aa30-99176101d51c-1566236777"}

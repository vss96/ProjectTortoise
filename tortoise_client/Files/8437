I've seen numerous cases where inserting a printf() changes the timing of the program such that the bug disappears. \r\n\r\nSecond, only _most_ debuggers suck. There's at least one that I've used that doesn't. The MULTI debugger from Green Hills Software is a commercial C/C++ debugger that completely changed my mind about the usefulness of debuggers. I find that I am at least 50% (maybe 100%) more productive using it than I am with any other debugging environment. \r\n\r\nDebuggers aren't simply useful for finding bugs, I also use them for developing the code itself. After I write some code, I step through it a few times in the debugger to double check my understanding of it. I can find problems quickly this way. \r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: I work for Green Hills Software as an field/development engineer. However, I do feel strongly that not all debuggers are worthless, and that at least the one I use daily (MULTI) is indespenseable.","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167242115,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t1_cw5co","edited":false,"id":"cw62k","author":"nickburlett","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809483,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53320-11f885f4-be1d-427b-85f4-9099be5a029a-1566236778"}

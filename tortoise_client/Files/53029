The book was so dry and difficult to read that the class ended up nominating and adopting a new text to use in its stead.  That's the only time, in my educational experience, where the class hated a book so much that they replaced it, regardless of the instructor's objections.\r\n\r\nThe other one I've read is Code Complete.  I bought it about a month ago, having heard everyone sing its praises.  However, I'm having trouble figuring out what audience it was supposedly written for.  I guess ignorant project managers who don't know their own ass from an if-else statement?  Maybe I'm the only one that thinks that people who manage software development project should have at least an intermediate understanding of programming.  And some of the advice, particularly the \"Defensive Programming\" section seems flat-out damaging.  I don't know- I'm sure that this book would be of some help to *somebody* out there, but I think most of this stuff would become obvious after a couple months of real programming experience (and subsequently be turned into habit faster than if one simply read it).","score":16,"ups":16,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164996444,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1677-62431d93-677f-4582-8aa9-45ce68eb91a3-1566236758"}

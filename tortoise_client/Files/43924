Thought Dawkins was on the spiel about \"no exceptions\". \r\n\r\n&gt; The World Trade Center bombings were not motivated by a twisted sort of religious belief ?\r\n\r\nOr perhaps because of US intervention in the middle east.\r\n\r\n&gt; The Sunni-Shia conflict in the middle-east is not a religious one ?\r\n\r\nYes, it has nothing to do with secular politics, and which families/ethnicities will be in control now that Saddam is gone.\r\n\r\n&gt; he Kashmir issue in India is not religion based ? \r\n\r\nLast I heard it wasn't about territory at all! Kashmir is the holiest site in all of Islam and Hinduism, and they both want it! Err.. wait.\r\n\r\n&gt; The butchering of thousands during India/Pakistan partition was not a Hindu-Muslim conflict ?\r\n\r\nAgain, nothing to do with secular politics and your run-of-the-mill ethnic cleansing.\r\n\r\n&gt; The Crusades were not based on Christian-Muslim hatred ?\r\n\r\nOr based on Vatican warmongering.\r\n\r\n&gt; And jews have been persecuted for millenia simply because they are jews.\r\n\r\nAnd never because they were among the wealthier, tending to be bankers and whatnot.\r\n\r\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167013111,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49293-50de28c7-d2aa-4bf9-b660-875bc1bcf478-1566236777"}

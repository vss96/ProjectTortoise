Phones which enable you to \"dial\" from another device (like a laptop) can be used as bugs.  BlueJackers can (from a decent distance) exploit design flaws in bluetooth phones, and have them \"dial\" any number they wish.  This can effectively be used as a \"bug\" since the person won't know their phone has made a call from their pocket (unless they check their dialed numbers).\r\n\r\n* Both cell phone and bluetooth headsets are unencrypted, and with only a few tools anyone can listen to anyone else's conversation.\r\n\r\n* There are services (in the UK at least) which allow anybody to [track](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/4747142.stm) anybody else's phone.  Many use insecure confirmation techniques, so all you would need to do is have access to the person's phone to respond \"ok\" via SMS, and then delete those txt messages from their phone.  Then you can track their phone online.\r\n\r\n* If you do have access to someone's phone (which I suspect in this case), you can bug the cell phone in which case it doesn't matter if the phone is on or off.  Some bugs can even use the battery on the phone.  You can prepare a phone ahead of time, and just swap out the user's SIM card and case if you like.\r\n\r\nI'm highly suspicious of the claim that the FBI can monitor anyone's cell phone when turned off.  Most likely, they swapped the phone or bugged it, or the phone wasn't really off in the first place.  I am a bit wary of the FBI tapping attorney's cell phones in general, though.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11314-d757dfb7-500d-4cc0-b3a2-82c73aacc6cb-1566236761"}

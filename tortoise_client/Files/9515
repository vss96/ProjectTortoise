It's 5:30 on a Friday now, though, so I might as well avoid work a bit more.\r\n\r\nI'm a professional programmer, 2 years out of college, working for a financial software startup.  My day job is almost all Java, with some small Python scripts for day-to-day tasks.  I've also had a long string of internships, mostly working with Java but also some Perl, C++, VB, and PHP work.  I also had a stint as lead programmer at [a nonprofit website](http://www.fictionalley.org/), all in PHP, and have done a few other PHP projects.\r\n\r\nMy hobby programming is almost all Haskell now, though a lot involves small language implementations with some code written in themselves.  I went through a Common Lisp phase back in college, but eventually decided it was something I didn't want to use on a day-to-day basis.  Still [enjoy Scheme](http://halogen.note.amherst.edu/~jdtang/scheme_in_48/tutorial/overview.html), though.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165013305,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2345-a256a0b0-8991-4f6c-819c-36902c081a3d-1566236758"}

It's a waste of time. I know that could introduce typos, but I tell you I get more done without this. I do good debugging and catch stuff on my own without having my IDE catch this.\r\n\r\nSure, throwing all the functions into the global namespace -- yeah, that sucks a lot. But that's what we've got until the community can convert it. I wish they would phase in namespaces in PHP6 and then phase out the old global namespace (as far as functions go) by around PHP8, or provide an INI option to turn it off right away.\r\n\r\nHaving to use -&gt; when a perfectly good \".\" will do, yeah, that sucks too. Using \".\" as a concatenator could still work because a future PHP could require \"&lt;space&gt;.&lt;space&gt;\" for it to be considered a concatenator. (Perhaps I can figure out a way to hook the PHP dev environment compiler with my own C code to do this? Of course, then my open source projects would then have to get bundled with this forked PHP environment then. Might only be a good solution for an office environment.)\r\n\r\nLack of Unicode support -- I expect that to get fixed soon. Right now I have to hook it with functions that switch data to HTML entities, convert the international characters to English characters, and then convert it back. That's a bit of a speed hit and I use it only where necessary. Some purists would rather store the data in Unicode format, but most of my stuff doesn't need international support. I just want to block the app from crashing or returning a funky search result because it stored stuff with international characters.\r\n\r\nFunction parameter order all screwed up -- yeah, I hope that gets fixed when PHP acquires a namespace. With so much talk about PHP and namespaces, I anticipate, and hope very much, that it adds it in and migrates all the functions in the current global namespace to it.\r\n\r\nBut other than that, there's not much else I would think it needs.\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164950985,"score":-7,"ups":-7,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"633-7bc8b338-f540-49ea-bb3a-d94fc172d9ab-1566236758"}

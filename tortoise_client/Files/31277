All I have to add is that the spiral of mediocrity is now complete, and next December no one will care who wins Person of the Year.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nTime's Person of the Year has taken the easy way out for over a decade, and his spiraled into mediocrity and irrelevance. The choice of Giuliani over Bin Laden in 2001, pointed out by this article, was simply the most glaring of a number of bogus calls. Take a look at the recent winners:\r\n\r\n1996: David Ho (b. 1952)\r\n\r\n1997: Andy Grove (b. 1936)\r\n\r\n1998: Bill Clinton (b. 1946) (2nd time) and Kenneth Starr (b. 1946)\r\n\r\n1999: Jeffrey P. Bezos (b. 1964)\r\n\r\n2000: George W. Bush (b. 1946)\r\n\r\n2001: Rudolph Giuliani (b. 1944)\r\n\r\n2002: The Whistleblowers: Cynthia Cooper of Worldcom (b. 963), Sherron Watkins of Enron (b. 1959), and Coleen Rowley of the FBI (b. 1954)\r\n\r\n2003: The American Soldier (2nd time)\r\n\r\n2004: George W. Bush (b. 1946) (2nd time)\r\n\r\n2005: The Good Samaritans: Bono (b. 1960), Bill Gates (b. 955), and Melinda Gates (b. 1964)\r\n\r\nI follow the news closely, and I don't recognize several of those names. Now compare with the following list:\r\n\r\n1937: Chiang Kai-Shek (1887–1975) and Soong May-ling (1898–2003) (first couple chosen)\r\n\r\n1938: Adolf Hitler (1889–1945)\r\n\r\n1939: Joseph Stalin (1879–1953)\r\n\r\n1940: Winston Churchill (1874–1965)\r\n\r\n1941: Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945) (3rd time) 1942: Joseph Stalin (1879–1953) (2nd time)\r\n\r\n1943: George Marshall (1880–1959)\r\n\r\n1944: Dwight Eisenhower (1890–1969)\r\n\r\n1945: Harry Truman (1884–1972)\r\n\r\n1946: James F. Byrnes (1879–1972)\r\n\r\n1947: George Marshall (1880–1959) (2nd time)\r\n\r\n1948: Harry Truman (1884–1972) (2nd time)\r\n\r\n1949: Winston Churchill (1874–1965) (2nd time) (\"Man of the Half-Century\")\r\n\r\nI'd expect that every person on that list is a household name with the possible exception of Byrnes. How many Americans can tell you who David Ho or Jeff Bezos is? Andy Grove? Watkins? Cooper? Rowley? (A better choice than them in 2002 would have been Kenneth Lay of Enron, of course). By avoiding controversy, Time has rendered its selection meaningless. If you look through the rest of the list, you'll see my argument confirmed. The earlier People of the Year are already more recognizable than the most recent ones - in 20 years, no one will have heard of any of these folks.\r\n\r\nI don't think Time will choose Stewart &amp; Colbert, simply because they've become so good at making the wrong choice.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33702-7e64fc3e-d96f-4657-8812-409830840408-1566236771"}

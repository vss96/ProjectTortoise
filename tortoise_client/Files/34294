But it's a long stretch to go from that to saying, point blank, that taste isn't subjective, full stop.  There are many possible criteria for judging art, and this essay describes one (subjective) idea for how it ought to be done.\r\n\r\nOne thing the essay ignores is, broadly speaking, the politics of art works.  Which is to say, some of the \"error\" in judging art comes from how we react to the political, symbolic, or narrative aspects of it.  But that isn't necessarily a bias we want to throw out; it might intentionally be at the center of one's well-developed artistic taste.  The question is not only, \"does the art succeed in reaching its audience in the intended way?\", but also \"is that a good thing?\"  From that perspective, the \"tricks\" an artist uses might be seen as positives in some cases.\r\n\r\nSo I can still look at a piece of pop culture junk and judge it bad art, because I don't think \"get as many people as possible to buy it\" as the sole purpose of a work of art is good.  Likewise, some of my favorite art is not in my view great because it's the most well-executed, technically advanced, and (in a gut reaction sense) aesthetically powerful.  It's great because (while being well-executed and fairly powerful visually) it has an intellectual component that I admire that brings it together.  Which is another way of saying that context is important; while it may be a \"bias\", it isn't necessarily an \"error\".","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ufsk","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23155-392d8b04-7cee-499f-839d-f21ce02e4d63-1566236766"}

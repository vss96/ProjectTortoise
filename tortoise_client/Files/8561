But, at the risk of sounding like a pointy-haired boss, beautiful isn't always practical.  I don't particularly like the fact that I need to buy a commercial implementation to get any work done either.\r\n\r\n&gt;Because you don't like to be told what your syntax has to be.\r\n\r\nTrue, Lisp syntax is very minimal, and I love the parenthesis (really), but it's not enough to convince me to master a language.\r\n\r\n&gt;Because it's fun.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it's one of the most fun, but there are a lot of fun languages I am already comfortable with, like Python, Ruby, OCaml, and Prolog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\n&gt;Seriously though, it is somewhat like asking, \"Why pizza?\". \r\n\r\nThis is just the kind of reply I was looking for.  If Lisp advocates simply stated \"Lisp is a good language with a lot of neat features, you should try it out sometime\", I wouldn't have posted this thread.  But instead, they, (especially Paul Graham) insist on calling it \"the most powerful programming language\", and everyone who doesn't like Lisp \"just doesn't get it\".  Big claims require big evidence.\r\n\r\nI probably will write something larger in Lisp to get a better feel for it.

I am coming at this from the 'There is not a Santa\" viewpoint.\r\n\r\nFirst, let the kid take the lead; mainly answer questions, and keep the answer short and to the point. Little kids don't want a 3 hour exegesis on the meaning of myth and modern society. \"Is Santa real?\" is most likely followed by a completely unrelated topic.\r\n\r\nTry to fold into the discussion the idea of \"different homes/different rules.\" This one I use a lot with my 7 yr old, as we walk up to the door of our neighbor's house. At that exact moment, he asks about Santa. I point out that I don't go for the Santa story, but maybe Anna and Sara do. I suggest not to make it an issue with them, as no one likes to have a surprise spoiled. He got it.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I don't go for the whole Santa idea is I like Christmas gifts to be a time to help my children learn about the love and selflessness of presents. I want them to know that presents have come from distance grandparents that couldn't be there. I want to help them select the gifts they will give to family and friends.\r\n\r\nOh, and we don't lie in our house. Can not teach them that by lying.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809210,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvrr4","parent_id":"t1_cvrdz","author":"tpodr","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45870-b18dc1f4-ab02-4760-b328-97f6d5716b9e-1566236775"}

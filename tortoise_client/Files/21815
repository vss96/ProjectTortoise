{"controversiality":0,"body":"You're right, I'm not in need- I make enough to live on because people are generous to me and to my charity. If they weren't, I would be in need. And if I was in need I wouldn't be doing my job anymore- I don't have any desire to be rich, but I'm not going to let my wife (who is a student) go homeless either.\r\n\r\nI still think that staff people are necessary. How many charities do you know that are run just by volunteers? Not many, at least not many that have more than 10 volunteers. If you've volunteered before and you think about it, you'd probably agree. Surely you are not saying that 90% of charities are corrupt.\r\n\r\nI put in 30 hours a week because I get paid for twenty- if I didn't get paid for 20 hours, I'd only be able to put in ten. Most volunteers are the same- they can't afford to put in more than 10+/week. The reality of any organisation is that you need a few people who give large chunks of time every week, which usually can't be done by volunteers. Think of your job- could it be split up and done by five different people and still work? And even if a staff person's job could be done completely by volunteers, good luck finding them- not all of our volunteers have the necessary training/experiance, and very very few of them would be willing to volunteer to do training and administrative work- they want to work directly with the people we are helping, which is where they should be.\r\n\r\nI generally do believe that I do a lot more good by being on staff than I would by just volunteering. For many charities, money is easy to come by. If I put in a little more effort, I know I could fundraise way more than I do. However, volunteers are very hard to come by. Most people are generous with their cash but not with their time. And most people just don't have time to give more than a few hours per week to volunteer. If my job could be done by volunteers I'd be all for it- I could easily find work elsewhere. But that just isn't a reality.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u89o","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165695853,"author":"aardvarkious","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu9i3","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu9ga","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808183,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18952-e1c492ac-ad12-4fdb-babe-be0271a66433-1566236764"}

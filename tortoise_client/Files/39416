Actually... Can't work.\r\n\r\nFundamental problem with coaches or rather buses. It's the same problem than trains have, and it's a problem which means that the bus or train can never ever replace the car. They're both **group** transport technologies. That means...\r\n\r\n* They **must** run to a schedule.\r\n* They **must** run to a fixed route.\r\n* They **must** stop at all or most stations to let people on and off.\r\n* They **must** be large heavy vehicles. With all their implications.\r\n\r\nThe result is that you have either, a very slow, inefficient system with vehicles running regularly stopping at lots of stations, or a fast, efficient system which denies access to most of the population because of relatively few stops and a irregular schedule.\r\n\r\nIt's a fundamental problem of all transport systems which try to move groups of people rather than individuals. If you improve accessibility you kill the efficiency of the system, stop/start driving, lots of empty vehicles etc. The optimum group transport system is an inter-city system, from A-&gt;B with no stops in between. The optimum intra city transport system is Personal Rapid Transit, moving individuals rather than groups.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9175-5adff392-9d91-465b-abb0-aa89eae92b5c-1566236761"}

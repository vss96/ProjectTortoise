Not a big deal yet, eh? However, Spider had broken copyright law by including parts of the BSD Unix TCP/IP stack, as well as the copyright notice for BSD Unix, inside their source code. Spider called it their own but failed to provide any documentation acknowledging borrowed code from BSD Unix as part of the BSD license. But if you were to take the original copy of Windows NT 3.1, and crack it open with a binary editor, you would see the BSD Unix copyright notice right in there -- the morons didn't even bother to remove that! So, with Spider breaking the law, and Microsoft purchasing the company, Microsoft absorbed this crime themselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough this article has been removed from the Internet, one person once posted this binary source so that you could actually see the bytes yourself where the BSD copyright was not even removed from NT 3.1's TCP/IP stack.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft even knew this themselves and with NT 3.5 they revised the stack with a clean room clone. Why would they even bother if they had not known they had broken the law? Sure, there could be other reasons such as optimization, a better rewrite, etc., but I think the improperly licensed code discovery was a big one.\r\n\r\nSo when Microsoft wants to go finger-pointing against Linux intellectual property, they should go no further than pointing at themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd if you really want to get angry at Microsoft tonight, look at the [latest PR statement here](http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/76270/index.html) from Waggener Edstrom, Microsoft's hired PR firm. If that doesn't make things clear as mud, I don't know what would. But if you want a clear translation, [look here](http://lxer.com/module/forums/t/24238/).\r\n","score":-2,"ups":-2,"created_utc":1166501350,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37507-b6536983-e3b8-4a4c-b320-3bd46ae22f33-1566236772"}

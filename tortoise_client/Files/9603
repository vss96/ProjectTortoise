It was not my intent to place you on the defensive. However, I must tell you that if what you wrote accurately reflects the sort of person you are, then you have a bit of a problem. \r\n\r\n*Even then, I would end up in physical altercations as I would routinely act in a hero capacity, racing up to jocks and pummeling them to the ground with a few select sweep kicks and punches to the groin when they would dare mock or physically assault some of my less-skilled brethren.*\r\n\r\nI do not believe that physical assault with unarmed combat techniques is a reasonable response to mockery. (And I do have some idea of what you're talking about doing; I'm a first *dan* in the shoto-kan style of karate.)\r\n\r\nBut what I found especially troubling was \r\n\r\n*And you don't EVEN want to have me overhear you emotionaly abusing your woman; i've sucker punched bosses before.*\r\n\r\nFirst of all, appointing yourself the arbiter of justice and imposing your views with physical violence is a bit far out, don't you think? Sort of like invading a nation, tearing up their infrastructure, and killing their population because we don't like their form of government?\r\n\r\nNot to mention that without a complete knowledge of the history of the situation, you don't know who is \"emotional abusing\" who. \r\n\r\nIn principle, I agree that people who physically abuse others need to be stopped, and if you have to hurt them to do it, hurt away. I've kicked a little ass myself, in my time. \r\n\r\nBut can you see how the tenor of your comments makes you appear to be someone who goes around looking for situations where you have an excuse to apply such a solution? And if you were that type of peron, how would you be different than those you are responding to?\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w4pi","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60835-43dea0ea-8d61-45ec-b2a2-7fa99f20c208-1566236780"}

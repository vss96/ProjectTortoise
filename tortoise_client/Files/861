The novel structure modeled in TFA could only come into being under quite extradinary circumstances (-9F + 40K atmospheres) and there's nothing to suggest it has an effect similar to Vonnegut's fictional Ice9.\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_up9f","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808498,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dbenhur","parent_id":"t1_cupeb","id":"cuq9r","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27456-acdba268-77f9-4066-995c-ce74d81fb48e-1566236768"}

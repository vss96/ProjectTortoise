{"controversiality":1,"body":"What crime? :P How can you even call it a crime? What is truth? What is crime? What is beauty? What is taste? Everything's subjective, everything's relative right?\r\n\r\nWe need something to take as truth. The truth (sorry) of the matter is that things like Gravity are demonstrated over and over. Why should God and other beliefs be treated any differently? If it/he/she/whatever-the-fuck-it-is killed a few animals in a controlled experiment, I'd be the first to ask the God or Gods how it or they want me to live.\r\n\r\nHow do we know the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy don't exist? What about Zeus? What about the Flying Spaghetti Monster? What about the killer rabbit from the Monty Python's The Holy Grail? What about the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot, aliens, the Abominable Snowman? If you're going to believe in Big Brother in the Heavens, then it's only logical to believe in all the others. They all have the same chances of existence, which means an *infinite* amount of beings can exist and you'd have to believe in all of them.\r\n\r\nNow which religion is going to get you into heaven? What if the religion doesn't exist yet? You're screwed then huh?","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v6h2","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166456525,"author":"OMouse","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cv80n","parent_id":"t1_cv7va","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808831,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"35921-7ee3622d-90c6-4c53-a772-214b5bea86e6-1566236772"}

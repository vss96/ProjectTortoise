And then, Biden uses South Carolina’s pro-slavery past as a “humorous” talking point, to pander to Republicans who think viewing South Carolina’s Articles of Secession is the ideal way to celebrate a white Christmas.\r\n\r\n    Biden was on a roll.\r\n\r\n    Delaware, he noted, was a “slave state that fought beside the North. That’s only because we couldn’t figure out how to get to the South. There were a couple of states in the way.”\r\n\r\n    The crowd loved it. \r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_thab","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165181137,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5395-a274f520-6981-495a-8411-f69f2d2b0db6-1566236759"}

Christianity and Islam are structured differently and in Islam, there is no central seat of religious authority, like the Vatican (yes, that means technically Muallah's should be out of a job, but thats another debate altogether).\r\n\r\nSecondly, it would be simplistic to assume that these laws are Pro- or Anti- Rape. Rape is a crime under the old and the new laws. The new laws would make it easier to prosecute rape and would do away with some of the arcane \"Shariah\" requirements needed to prove rape. While that is a change that is long overdue and welcome, let us not totally demonize those who speak out against the law.\r\n\r\nLastly, the policy changes you speak of are made to accommodate the MMA, which is sadly a requirement to getting the law passed. It should be noted that the MMA was never a political heavyweight until after the Afghan and Iraq war. The Musharraf govt. belives that in its current form the bill will not be passed and will not bring any change at all. Right or wrong, it is hence hoping to gradually change things and that requires diplomacy. It politics, stop trying to make everything reflect on culture.\r\n\r\nPeace.","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5542-ec6d526b-a399-455b-bd76-becfed1250c2-1566236759"}

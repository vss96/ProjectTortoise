Or maybe some fellow redditor will do it ;)\r\n\r\nI worked with Interbase \"back in the day\" a lot and while it was not slow, it was just fair. Some queries were puzzling in performance but ok. When I moved to Firebird I was _shocked_ how fast it was compared to that (even adjusting for hardware progress) - it was at least on par with MySQL for \"simple\" things and of course much more capable.

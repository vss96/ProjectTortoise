I haven't read or heard of his thoughts on buddhism (although I did see the Penn &amp; Teller episode where they sniped at the Dalai Lama... the pricks); is that religion inherently evil as well?

Dawkins' vitriol is completely unnecessary and in poor taste. \r\n\r\nWith elections hinging on a razor's edge, let me be the first to thank Dawkins for alienating and offending simple people of simple faiths and driving them to vote for the warmongers.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0sy","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809397,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"TheNoxx","id":"cw1jk","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w0sy","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50892-6b818252-2810-4f6d-b4bf-c02583eab662-1566236778"}

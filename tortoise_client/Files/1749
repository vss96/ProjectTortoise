Seems to be an odd mixture of HTML and XHTML.  The doctype is HTML, and it uses no-closing-tag `&lt;p&gt;` elements (legal HTML, illegal XHTML), but uses `&lt;element /&gt;` for empty elements (illegal HTML, legal XHTML).  Also, the use of `&amp;nbsp;` for indentation is a bit bizarre.  The use of the `&lt;b&gt;` tag, though legal in the `Transitional` doctype, is frowned-upon.\r\n\r\nThe validator seems confused by the `xmlns` attribute on the `&lt;html&gt;` tag, and seems to skip the opening `&lt;head&gt;` tag, failing the remainder of the document.  [If XHTML validation is forced](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ftwb.ath.cx%2F%7Etwb%2Fcanon%2Fsicp%2Fbook-Z-H-04.html&amp;charset=%28detect+automatically%29&amp;doctype=XHTML+1.0+Transitional), it again trips up on the non-closed `&lt;p&gt;`'s.\r\n\r\nIf by \"clean\" you mean \"pleasant to look at\", however, I agree that it is reasonably so.  Though it's not a particularly *difficult* thing to achieve in uncomplicated HTML documents (read: non-commercial, no sidebars, no fancy layout, what-HTML-was-originally-designed-for-type-documents).  The copyright violation mentioned by rahul is also probably not the best thing in world.\r\n\r\n(Edit: Oh, and a note to the reddit devs: if code is between `` `backquotes` ``, left-angle-brackets are already escaped by Markdown, so they don't need to be escaped again.)","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tih1","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807687,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nmessenger","edited":false,"id":"ctiyr","parent_id":"t3_tih1","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6176-50c0764c-ec70-4a6d-8364-34810d44d2ee-1566236760"}

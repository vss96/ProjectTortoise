I remember the person leaving because his colleague got blown up in the Israeli-Palestine conflict.   But when did it become a requirement that to work for PHP you must support Israeli military tactics?\r\n\r\n&gt; I hope a lot more people quit after this.\r\n\r\nThat's a god-awful stupid reason to quit using a tool.\r\n\r\nAll products have bugs, and all products have security holes.  In fact, Esser believes that his new role will help make PHP more secure.  So, assuming he has good intentions and isn't doing this as some kind of hissy-fit ego-boost, there is now -more- of a reason to use PHP.\r\n\r\n&gt; SECURITY THROUGH OBSCURITY ..

This is supposed to return a list from which the first elements satisfying p are dropped, paired with the original list. Here is the code:\r\n\r\n    dropWhile' p = fold f v\r\n      where\r\n        f x (ys, xs) = (if p x then ys else x : xs, x : xs)\r\n        v            = ([], [])\r\n\r\nNow I don't get how this can even type, as the if expression returns either a list or a pair of lists. Also, I don't get how the list pair is making any difference. In a strict language there is no way to implement dropWhile with a fold(r), because the evaluation order is wrong, from the inside out. foldl would do the trick pretty well though. Thus there must be something related to lazy evaluation here (even if Mr. Hutton doesn't appear to be concerned about strict vs. lazy), but I can't see how it works or why it should work only on the paired list result case and not also on the single list result case.","retrieved_on":1473807462,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_t5vi","id":"ct71d","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"660-6c118857-60d9-4334-b40c-50bd0cdbdbce-1566236758"}

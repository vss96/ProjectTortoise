{"controversiality":0,"body":"Actually the comment is frequently made that something is inherently wrong with human beings because we continuously obsess over news items that are bizarre/grotesque or which reveal the darker side of us, while seemingly ignoring items that highlight our more admirable and lighter attributes. Put simply we focus much more on \"bad news\" than \"good news\". \r\n\r\nBut there seems to me to be a much simpler explanation. \"Bad news\" will very frequently make us think \"something should be done/I should do something about this\" where as \"good news\" rarely does.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we have evolved to focus on \"bad\" things because they imply a potential danger to ourselves or our loved ones and therefore generally require some kind of (frequently urgent) action to be taken. \"Good\" occurrences usually mean we don't need to do anything out of the ordinary - just relax, things are going well.\r\n\r\nImagine what would happen if we worked the other way - ignoring or denying the bad news while obsessing or hyping up the good news. Oh wait! Don't need to imagine it. Iraq is a testament to doing just that.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_toga","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165323915,"author":"llmikeb","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_toga","edited":false,"id":"ctopo","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807794,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8786-f92933b2-54ea-44d2-8311-3e3336c0048a-1566236760"}

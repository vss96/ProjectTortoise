For a person with a typical hearing range of 20kHz, 44.1kHz means that the max frequency is at ~22kHz or so.\r\n\r\nHowever, any high frequency component that may exist above the 22kHz mark will be folded back into the spectrum. Sampling at a higher frequency cancels some of that \"noise\". I'm not sure what the author means by affecting the lower frequencies, but this aliasing effect occurs mainly at the tail end of the spectrum.","created_utc":1166543788,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vb19","id":"cvd7w","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"cal_01","retrieved_on":1473808930,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38455-ed505bb9-25cc-4393-94f7-5a6267480635-1566236773"}

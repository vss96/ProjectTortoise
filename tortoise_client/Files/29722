I support an architecture firm that has one still-fairly-necessary product that requires a dongle.  It's a hold out from their older system that we've been upgrading away from, but we haven't yet found a reasonable replacement that provides 100% of the functionality.\r\n\r\nI wrote a pretty blunt memo to the company that said that the dongle (and its associated issues) was an important consideration in our move **away** from their products.  2 weeks later we got a huge folder of brochures for their latest stuff.  No mention of the dongle.  I called their support line and checked on their user forums. Sure enough, it's still part of the deal, they just stopped *telling* people about it upfront.\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tz2u","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808029,"author":"toastspork","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu0jr","id":"cu1d0","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14621-00b23962-e7f6-4d61-8f49-f2bd3077a88b-1566236762"}

Note that I edited my last post over the course of 10 minutes, to provide examples and explain further.\r\n\r\nI happened to be sitting at the computer.  I also noticed that \"can certainly have owners\" was probably something of a cognitive typo and decided to read it as \"can certainly have money\".  You did introduce a couple of wholly new (for your post) concepts that weren't already there, however, and I tend to think such things are inappropriate to an edit after public posting.  They might have done better in a separate post.\r\n\r\n&gt; Only if you assume special belief systems which have principles which support property.\r\n\r\nEven if you don't, you should still be able to recognize that property is an extension of principles -- even if they're principles you discard as invalid.  If you're not a Marxist or nonaggression principle libertarian, that doesn't mean you can't look at the idea of proprietary rights and recognize it as an extension of principles central to both Marxist collectivism and nonaggression principle libertarianism.  It follows logically from principles.  You can't change that by disbelieving those principles.  You can only say that, valid though it might be, it's untrue.\r\n\r\nAt least, that's all you can say with any hope of accuracy.\r\n\r\n&gt; right-wing libertarian, which you mention\r\n\r\nWhile there certainly are \"right-wing libertarians\", I did not in any way, sense, or form mention right-wing libertarianism.  Nonaggression principle libertarians and self-ownership libertarians are not right-wing libertarians.  I think you may be confused about what constitutes \"right-wing\" and what constitutes \"libertarianism\".\r\n\r\n&gt; I don't consider someone's ownership of a natural resource (like a region's water supply) to be particularly \"natural.\"\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean that proprietary rights are not, as a concept, an extension of principles.  It just means that you disagree with the formulation of those principles, or that you reject the derivation of proprietary rights on some other grounds unrelated to where they arise.\r\n\r\n&gt; The free rider problem predicts that public goods are underproduced.\r\n\r\nThus, the requirement that for there to be a \"free rider\" problem there must be a finite resource.\r\n\r\n&gt; Many people who'd love to write Free Software games (to train, say, firemen through simulations) can't find the funding, due to the costs of developing modern games.\r\n\r\n1. Your crappy business model is not my problem.\r\n2. Some people make great money writing open source software.\r\n3. You seem to be unaware of some great open source games that use 3D rendering engines and real-time action.  Yes, they're few and far between, but they do exist.  The problem isn't funding, it's anticompetitive strategies from large, established competitors.\r\n\r\n&gt; You're unaware that a classic solution is federal subsidy\r\n\r\nNo, I'm not unaware.  I just reject it as a \"solution\" because it introduces at least as many problems as it purports to solve.\r\n\r\n(edit: typo fix)","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ug5r","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165949898,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25341-bea1667a-2fe9-4d3f-9313-dbc0d389a7a7-1566236767"}

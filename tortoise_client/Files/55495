Becuase yahoo instant messenger, mail, toolbars, etc all pwn your computer if you try and install any of them. That suite of programs is borderline spyware. After it pwns all your webbrowsers to redirect to yahoo theres no wonder your uncited, unreferenced numbers are better. Say it now, QUANTITY DOESNT EQUAL QUALITY. What about cool web search? I bet they have a few billion pageviews a month.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, I have seen users fireup IE and get the default msnbc/yahoo sites, but then actually type google the url in and go there to do searching. **Most people cannot change their default home page** .

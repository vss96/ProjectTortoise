{"body":"Has there been a case where a student received damages because a public school teacher has either compelled speech (flag salute or mandatory prayer) or preached in class? I don't think so. At most they'd look for an injunction against this particular teacher preaching to future classes. Violate injunction --&gt; go to jail for contempt or get fined. Why do people think the kid's looking for money? Personally I think the teacher went WAY over the line even if you don't adhere to a \"wall of separation\" view of the First Amendment. Children in public school are a captive audience.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v6h2","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"created_utc":1166454956,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cv7w8","parent_id":"t1_cv7no","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808828,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35866-2f402143-0aa4-4350-be4c-a2b25f25f7b1-1566236771"}

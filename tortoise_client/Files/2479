Seriously?\r\n\r\nBelieve me, we've all noticed it. Just as pop music has verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus-chorus, classical music has a variety of formal structures (binary form, sonata form, etc). The difference is that in much pop music, \"verse\" means 4 chords over and over, \"chorus\" means (if you're lucky) a different set of 4 chords over and over, to the point where it sounds like a third-rate Vivaldi (and Vivaldi is already third-rate IMHO.)\r\n\r\n&gt;And chords are not just chords in modern music. Add an amp, and you get almost limitless amounts of variations, starting with overtones.\r\n\r\nAmps simply make music louder, so I'll assume that you also meant distortion and whatnot. Unfortunately, distortion has the exact *opposite* effect -- chords are much *less* than chords. With the distortion cranked high enough, anything more sophisticated than a power chord sounds too muddy to be useful. So a lot of bands limit themselves to playing a repeated pattern of power chords, as I have already ranted about.\r\n\r\n95% of the time, Distortion/fx simply give you a different sound, so a more appropriate analogy is adding one more instrument to your orchestra. It certainly doesn't turn boring music into \"almost limitless amounts of variations\".\r\n\r\nFYI, this is from who listens to lots of rock music. There's a lot of cool stuff out there, but it floats in a sea of uninteresting crud.\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807845,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctqyl","edited":false,"id":"ctrh9","author":"arthurdenture","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10148-3c2ac4c2-a20e-4254-a62a-7a772b7ad584-1566236761"}

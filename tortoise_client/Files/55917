Similarly, speakers need to be matched with an appropriate amplifier. Low-impedance speakers, particularly if they look very reactive or capacitive, need an amplifier that won't balk at delivering current into such a load.\r\n\r\nBut in the end, you need to listen to them with music you like, ideally using your own equipment and in your own home.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wiqk","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60068-6534e7ed-4cc6-4a24-bb2f-d878b7ad952b-1566236780"}

The wireless is a cool feature IF it did something worthwhile like auto-update my podcasts.\r\n\r\nI think the reason it doesn't appear to have much mass-market appeal is that when placed next to an iPod or another music player, it looks like a thick brick.\r\n\r\nThe Zune reminds me a lot of X-Box 1.  It's technilogically superior to the Playstation 2, but it looked like a thick ugly box.  Microsoft needs to (and no doubt will) come out with a Zune that is more like the X-Box 360.  It needs a sleek look, and it needs to have the cool ideas from the first generation fully realized in a way that the other products can't compete with.  Maybe they need a Zune Live that the players can connect to via WiFi to access cool content or to brag about how much music you listen to.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_we0w","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167494697,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58727-06b9315d-fe55-4e01-8562-7f2280d5ec9c-1566236780"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"I knew somebody who was actually a prodigy.  He claimed to have an IQ of 180, and I believed him.  He went to a small, no-name state school because that's what was available in his area.  A kid that age isn't ready to move into a dorm, and if the family doesn't happen to live in Boston or another city with a good school, the kid goes to the school nearby.\r\n\r\nHe ended up dropping out of college and working at blue collar jobs.  The last time I heard about him, he was living with his mother and hadn't worked for a year or so.\r\n\r\nBut I don't believe the kid in this article is a prodigy either.  He'll probably rebel against his controlling dad when he's a little older.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uhfb","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":5,"score":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165936829,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lysine23","id":"cuksg","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cui8y","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808396,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24869-2b59a901-97e1-41fa-9b2e-669e9c942994-1566236767"}

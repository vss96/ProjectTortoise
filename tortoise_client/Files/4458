This is... disturbing. This guy wrote my life's story ! (sadly, it's a publically available essay, so I can't really ask for royalties. *sigh*)\r\n\r\nWhen I got to university, I really hit a wall. A tall, self-made wall. I went on through my B.Sc. with a mixture of pride and ego (\"I'm so much better than anyone here, and this assignment's way too easy\") and of pessimism and self-pity (\"Oh shit, I won't be able to do that.\"), all at the same time.\r\n\r\nSo basically, language-wise, I'd pick up one at random, study it for a while, get a feel for it, write a few trivial programs in it, start something bigger... and drop it so I could study a new one. This happened with Lisp, incidentally. I fell in love with the language, but more in a theoritical, \"Shit this is so cool\" way.\r\n\r\nSo here I am, possibly a BMM like the author describes, with a CS bachelor's degree in my pockets who's never written anything past 2-3000 LOC, nothing non-trivial. I seriously wonder how I'll do at the job I recently got which begins in early january.\r\n\r\nSorry for this blog-like post, but I guess I needed to get that out of my system.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809070,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvkfj","parent_id":"t1_cvk3b","author":"SolarBear","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42198-e325c958-550e-4938-858c-bcfc4d147bc9-1566236774"}

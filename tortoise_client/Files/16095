{"body":"He is also passionate about the environment, but not in a stupid, hippy kind of way.  He encourages people to reach their potential and develop profitable, science-based ways of improving our usage of the Earth.\r\n\r\nHe came and talked at my school once, and the auditorium was so packed we had to use the Gargoyle as an overflow room.  I watched from there as he said, \"But it's not all bad news.  Have you seen these things?  They're called batteries.  Whichever one of you figures out a way to get rid of these is gonna be RICH!\"  He was talking about ways to reduce the harm and pollution of disposable battery use, then he went on to talk about some of the new fuel cell powered laptops that people are researching.\r\n\r\nAll in all he struck me as a guy who is passionate about science, but more than that, passionate for truth-seeking.  I love that in a man.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vqnl","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":0,"score":0,"created_utc":1166849725,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvr7t","edited":false,"id":"cvtgu","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809244,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46837-7da097f8-0da7-462c-bc39-fd3287b47817-1566236775"}

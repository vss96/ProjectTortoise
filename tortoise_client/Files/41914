I think to really evaluate the above stats you'd have to look at where the accidents occurred. I bet the euro ones were on the highway where the speed limits are much higher (i don't necessarily agree with that either). Point being, i think the US does MUCH more driving on local roads, ie, bikes and cars mixed together. \r\nDon't be fooled into thinking we have great safety regulations. 2 facts related the popularity of SUV's 1) the NTSHA doens't currently test cars for side impact from an SUV. so if you get t-boned in your honda civic by a yukon, NOBODY knows what's going to happen, but you can certainly guess...feel safe now? 2) jersey barriers which keep oncoming cars for jumping into your lane were designed for cars. I think many states are working to install taller ones, but that takes years. read \"High and Mighty\" by the NYTimes auto editor about SUVs (these facts and more).

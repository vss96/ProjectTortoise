{"body":"No, it often does make sense for college students.  If you're getting in-state instead of out-of-state tuition, you're saving on the order of $15k/year.  Your monthly mortgage payments plus any depreciation in the house's value (unlikely) have to be $1250 more than monthly rent in that location for you to come out ahead without the house.  I don't know many real estate markets in the U.S. where monthly rental prices are $1250 less than a mortgage on the same property.\r\n\r\nCollege financial aid does very weird things to traditional finance notions.  For example, it was *cheaper* for me to go to an expensive private college than to the state school down the street, because the private college covered 2/3 of my tuition in outright grants.  Moreover, it made sense for us to take out a home equity loan (something I'd normally stay the fuck away from), because home equity loans reduce your assets by their full amount in the financial aid calculations, which meant that we got something like $10k/year more in grants than we otherwise would've.  I suppose they would've been low-interest student loans anyways, but my parents refinanced the home equity loan into a fixed-rate mortgage right when interest rates were at their lowest, and so its interest rate is actually lower than my student loans.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v88c","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166505308,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvbce","parent_id":"t1_cva0w","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808894,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37606-08dc2e08-c42b-43e1-8a8a-93e589ba3b7f-1566236772"}

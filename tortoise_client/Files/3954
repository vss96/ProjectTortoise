Some travelers (probably the vast majority being people who frequently travel in their work) are willing to pay for a quick, efficient checkpoint security scan of their body and carry-on items. As a traveler, that's fine with me as long as that scan serves it purpose and is not a slack, perfuctory \"buy-through.\"\r\n\r\nWhat annoys the hell out of me is standing in line behind people wagging loads of carry-on. I wish there was a free, security fast-lane for people who have NO carry-on of any sort.\r\n\r\n Hmm? OK, compromise: How about men putting the stuff they normally carry in their pockets and women carry in their purses, such as ID, cash, coins, credit cards, keys, being put into one of those SMALL, clear, plastic bags? And a magazine or book. But NO electronics or luggage slowing down the free express lane.","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9954-94273ba0-643d-4d0f-905c-37747f760673-1566236761"}

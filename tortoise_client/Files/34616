As a result the thought of theft never enters my mind as I am not treated like a thief.\r\n\r\nSo if a bouncer checks your ID at a bar, does he think you're not who you say you are? If your teacher checks your homework, does that mean they think you did it wrong, or not at all? And are you paranoid about them as well? \r\n\r\nSounds like you could use that reading comprehension class yourself. Though I gather, if you're paranoid about anyone who disagrees with you, I'm guessing comprehension is not something you're altogether interested in.\r\n\r\n&gt;By the way, which corporate entity do you work for?\r\n\r\nFunny, someone ranting about being accused of \"stealing\" for having their receipt checked, would then accuse someone of \"working for a corporate entity\" and \"being paranoid of them\" for simply asking why they think that way. But hey, foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds like mine.\r\n\r\noh, and it's spelled \"receipt\".","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807523,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctab1","parent_id":"t1_ct5b4","author":"rafuzo2","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2265-98e5985c-765c-4f14-86dd-6215e15e982f-1566236758"}

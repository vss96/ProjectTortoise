Otherwise, we're debating under the assumption that I told the truth. \r\n\r\nSecond: what I'm saying isn't far-fetched, so it's really just a nasty defensive move to question my statements. If I said I was homeschooled on the moon, you could call me a liar. If I said I was the son of a celebrity, you could say you doubt it. \"I was homeschooled and it didn't go well, and I ended up doing something else\" is only slightly more far-fetched than \"I crossed the street today\".\r\n\r\nThird: One and a half years of homeschooling is plenty enough to see what it's like. Also, you've got to realize I knew and still know those other people who were homeschooled. \r\n\r\nFourth: We can argue about whether most homeschooling works or most doesn't, and with plenty of evidence. It's stupid to say the statement \"generally it doesn't\" is made up BS. It's an opinion I formed based on first hand experience and some amount of evidence. Let's argue about those things instead of calling conflicting opinions invalid.\r\n\r\nFifth: You know hundreds of people with home educations, \"with most approaching exceptional\"? No, you don't. You're saying most of this group of hundreds of homeschoolers are way, way above average (exceptional) compared to the government educated kids. You can make a case that homeschooling is better, but I don't think *anyone* is going to buy the idea that almost all homeschoolers end up better than almost all public schoolers.\r\n\r\nSixth: I got lucky insofar as my parents did two things: first, they left me alone to read whatever I wanted, and I was smart enough to read the right things (and give them to my brother to read). Second, they quickly realized that homeschooling was headed towards failure and forced me kicking and screaming into early college. I'm lucky compared to other homeschoolers, because most of their parents had a weak understanding of one or two (or three or four) important subjects, and supplemented their weaknesses with drills from mediocre books, or else by ignoring the subjects entirely. I'm lucky because I went to a good university, whereas most of my homeschooling peers didn't.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ut1n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166745939,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44586-8316a9ed-6ccb-4088-9344-4148ab8bbf13-1566236774"}

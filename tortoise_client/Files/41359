It's like near impossible without using the extreme hard work (and several lines of Javascript or whatever), to make it all happen in CSS, DHTML, and Javascript. By SVG becoming a standard supported by IE, and being consistent with how Firefox supports it -- that would make a world of difference here.\r\n\r\nAdobe -- I wish someone would flip on their \"cool mode\" switch. They have so much potential to not become another Microsoft and to join the GNU / FLOSS community.

The iPod has revolutionized how people listen to music.  It may not have all the functionality you might want, but that does not mean that it sux. \r\n\r\nMost consumers could care less weather or not the database is proprietary.  Thay just want something simple that works and looks cool.\r\n\r\niTunes is super easy to use and you can just drag and drop song files into iTunes pretty easily.\r\n\r\nBy the time the battery dies in most products people are alreadry ready for a new model anyway.\r\n\r\nIf the iPod interface in frustrating, then how do you manage to tie your shoes in the morning?  I guess you are a loafer kinda guy.  I can't see how it could be any more simple to use.\r\n\r\nGot any proof that iTunes reports people's activities?\r\n\r\nDuh, every single product on the market that has any well know brand attached to it has some cost incurred from that brand.  That is why companies advertise. If iPods are so damn expensive and frustrating, then it makes you wonder how they outsell the competition by a mile.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wi17","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809735,"distinguished":null,"author":"BLACKINFIDEL","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwjhk","parent_id":"t1_cwit6","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60100-8ac8528c-fb24-4764-aecb-767fe15f11e3-1566236780"}

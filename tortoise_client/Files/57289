I think you'd enjoy it.\r\n\r\nI'm paying for plenty of stupid mistakes.  I am missing part of a tooth that I knocked out in my childhood.  I have a permanently compromised immune system due to losing my spleen because of trauma.  I can't grow hair in a small patch on the left side of my head because I ran into a wall when I was 3.\r\n\r\nThe idea isn't punishment.  The idea is keeping the general populace safe from reckless drivers.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166229199,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuz59","id":"cuzd5","author_flair_text":null,"author":"recursive","retrieved_on":1473808668,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31764-9a9c131c-f343-4076-9d24-e7d65a912e71-1566236770"}

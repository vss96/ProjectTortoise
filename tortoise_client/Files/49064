Japanese price for the Wii appears to be 25,000 yen (can't confirm it went on sale at that price, only that Nintendo said it would launch for under 25,000) yen. Now, let's convert that to UK pounds. Exchange rate is 0.004381 (from Yahoo! Finance) making it £109.536900.\r\n\r\nCall it £110. Now, I have no idea if that includes tax, so lets stick 17.5% (UK sales tax) on it, and we get £129.25.\r\n\r\nDo you know how much the Wii actual sells for the in the UK? £180. Almost a 40% price increase because I live in the UK! And if that wasn't enough, the video cable supplied with the Wii is composite, which, frankly, who is going to use? So not only am I paying for a useless cable, I then have to pay another £25 for a decent cable (either component or RGB SCART).\r\n\r\nSo, yes, I'd like a little more value for money here. As it stands, I'm holding off until the price drops.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4807-550603d5-706c-4476-90df-725065d25e51-1566236759"}

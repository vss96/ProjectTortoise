It's just a little black, on the outside, in just one corner.\r\n\r\nThen the article, the description seems really wrong.  It is described as if something inside the machine exploded and combusted (soot?).  But, where would all that power come from?  An ethernet or USB cable (what else would go between the modem and the computer?) would melt long before the computer would do that.\r\n\r\nIt seems a lot more like the TV cable got wired incorrectly, and the modem, directly connected to it, exploded, sending it's black soot out, onto the things nearby, including one corner of the computer.","retrieved_on":1473808888,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvb25","parent_id":"t3_v45e","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"arantius","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37469-4548196b-9abf-4fc4-aad3-fbe57c29b069-1566236772"}

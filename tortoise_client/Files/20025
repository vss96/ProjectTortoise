I took plenty of German in high school.\r\n\r\nWhen I started to study Japanese in collage, I was amazed by the difficulty of kanji.\r\n\r\nThe grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary were all easy. I knew enough words in the three languages mentioned above to have a meaningful mnemonic for almost every work.\r\n\r\nI would say I could memorize 40 vocab words for each Kanji I learned.\r\n\r\nThat is a low-ball.\r\n\r\nGiven the flexibility and completeness of hiragana and katakana, I see no reason to continue teaching Kanji.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809411,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vzzg","id":"cw2c3","author":"IKbot","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51256-b9aedf83-6eec-4e02-9da8-ee41afaea30e-1566236778"}

{"controversiality":1,"body":"Complete bullshit. The reason women are not getting hired is very few of them are taking the time to be properly trained. Most CS courses have very few women and EE courses have even less.\r\n\r\nLikewise, how often do you hear about women writing their own operating systems or programming languages just for fun?\r\n\r\nIf a women wants to get into IT and cannot because of her gender, then we have a problem. But so long as the few women who do want to can have a career, who cares about the rest who do not.\r\n\r\nAs for the number of women in high ranking positions, well duh! If only 1 in 20 developers is a woman, then of course there are going to be fewer in the high ranking positions. In fact it should be a lot less than 1 in 20 because women, unlike men, have to give up their career for a time being if they want children. It is unfortunate, but those are the rules of child brith.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_urzo","subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166119246,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"grauenwolf","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_urzo","id":"cusfl","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808537,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28380-f43392f6-d03e-4c91-9799-76503bc28640-1566236768"}

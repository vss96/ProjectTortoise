I suggest to the author (or rather, to you since the author isn't likely to read this) that you look at Christian practices over the last 200 years in various parts of Africa and the South Pacific.  You will find a similar 'replacement' of pagan worship sites by Christian churches.\r\n\r\nThis practice is so common, especially on the part of the Catholic church, that there is a church in Guatemala where the people worship 'Saint Judas'; Judas was the Christian figure closest to their pagan god. (This info is as of 1980, perhaps the Church has cracked down on this.  But I doubt they would change 300 years of practice.)\r\n\r\nIf you look at history, the Islamic world has sometimes been very tolerant of conquered peoples' religion.  The Christian conquerors have been much more eager to change their subjects' religion.  \r\n\r\nSo, the author's assertions do not match the facts.

{"body":"I see reddit really *isn't* the bastion of thought some people here come to it for. The majority of the posts here are simply of people of a closed-minded disposition and I say congratulations, you think religion is a fraud but you're acting exactly like your closed-minded counterparts *in* religions. Can't beat them, join them, right?\r\n\r\nReincarnation has no connection to religion, despite what some people on here seem to think. It is born of a philosophical disposition and actually has more of a backing in science and there is yet to be anything to disprove it, and to those comparing it to religion this would be the place where atheism loses to it.\r\n\r\nI also find it comforting that the Dalai Lama actively solicits scientific testing of meditation and anything else that scientists can test. Despite sceptics saying meditation is nothing but deep breathing, there's a vast amount of information stating meditation really does have an effect on the body and mind.\r\n\r\nKnowledge speaks, but wisdom listens. So actually listen, some people here seem to have criticised it before even opening it.","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_vo8v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166759778,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","id":"cvpqk","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vo8v","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809172,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44887-441303c3-cba4-48d6-850c-e89b6b19926b-1566236774"}

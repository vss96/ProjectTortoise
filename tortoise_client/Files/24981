I had just taken a couple of days without caffeine, and went to bed before midnight -- early for me.\r\n\r\nI was lying in bed, meditating, trying to be conscious of falling asleep (after Feynman). I started with deep breathing, then slowed my breathing -- basically trying to breathe only through my nose, as slowly as possible. After a few false starts, where I'd be like \"Wow! I'm about to fall asleep\", causing me to wake up, I think I fell asleep. The weird thing is that I was really, really warm, while still being conscious. I eventually had to stop, and then try to sleep normally, as I got too hot, and had to remove the cover.\r\n\r\nThe visual sensation was one of deeper darkness, with some aurora-like retina stimulation -- no awareness of the light seeping through my curtains, and presumably eyelids, though. I also realized later that I wasn't noticing any house or yard noises, even though these were apparent once I awoke.\r\n\r\nThe warm drifting feeling seems to be accentuated by being very conscious of not moving. Kind of a warm paralysis. It's a bit unsettling at first, but then very comfortable.\r\n\r\nI'd like to investigate this more quantitatively. If what I experienced is the same as what's described in the article, then no religious basis is necessary.","created_utc":1166585004,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vd9p","edited":false,"id":"cvg5c","author_flair_text":null,"author":"HiggsBoson","retrieved_on":1473808986,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40102-ee1a13cc-c579-4315-a5fb-b4b66448bb6f-1566236773"}

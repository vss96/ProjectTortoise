Why not give the type variables some meaningful names and factor out some of the intermediate types?\r\n\r\nI'm sure you'd develop an intuition for this kind of thing if you wrote enough Haskell, but it still seems too clever by half.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uqo3","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","ups":4,"score":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166113545,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"twoodfin","id":"cus1w","parent_id":"t1_curbw","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808530,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28191-f0f93e32-7ab6-40c1-831e-f60fc708927b-1566236768"}

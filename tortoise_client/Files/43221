For example, if I maliciously break my neighbor's window by throwing a rock through it, I will likely be found guilty of a crime and sentenced to pay fines or serve community service or both. That sentence will be worth far more than the cost of the broken window. Why? To deter me and everyone else in the community from doing such a thing. Also, I did more than just break a window; I broke the social contract and bothered my neighbor.\r\n\r\nAlthough corporations are also legal persons, for some reason we don't try to deter them as we do other persons when they commit crimes. The result is that corporations commit crimes all the time, pay a few million dollars penalty, and then go on to commit crimes again. I think we need to do something different if we want different results, and I think levying appropriate penalties against corporations would be a good start.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vfw5","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166720612,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":0,"score":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43532-9037238a-9860-4ffd-b9d5-e6654db86a67-1566236774"}

For someone like me, it is an incrediably clumsy way to perform Stream operations.\r\n\r\nStreams are probably one of the most elegant and stable concepts found in OO programming. The underlying store can be raw memory, files, network sockets, or even a BLOB field in a database. And independent of that, you can wrap them with ANSI or unicode encoders, encryption, compression, filters, or just about anything else you can imagine. \r\n\r\nSo to tell someone like me that I cannot use streams because \"state is evil\" and it will \"make me impure\" is downright ludicrous.\r\n\r\nYou might as well try to tell me that I cannot alter the phone number property on a customer object. Oh wait, you are.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17413-5ffbd066-a705-4424-9fd4-030eec9d8a0f-1566236763"}

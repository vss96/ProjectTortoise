Consider a similar art form to painting in music. Let's look at popular music. From the billboard 200 singles this week:\r\n1. Beyonce: Irreplaceable\r\n2. Fergie: Fergalicious\r\n3. Akon Featuring Eminem: Smack That \r\n\r\nBy most contemporary definitions, these works are by definition art. They are currently the most popular new music, and are emblematic to what people like.\r\n\r\nNow, I venture to guess that most Redditers would not consider this *good* art. Our tastes are different. Is it merely what we are familiar with? Is it that we have better taste? Wait, that's moving into the subjective mighty quickly here!\r\n\r\nNow, Paul does say: \"There are two main kinds of error that get in the way of seeing a work of art: biases you bring from your own circumstances, and tricks played by the artist.\"\r\n\r\nOne might make an argument that these are popular based on tricks. Just like airbrushing, tricks based on music are similarly possible. Yet, what is a \"trick\" to one is an integral part of technique to other. (To the original analogy - is a reference to a deity a \"trick?\" Is it a trick for Michaelangelo that shapes our frame of reference? Is it a trick for Thomas Kinkade? How about Pointilism and Monet?)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure. However, I do know that there are quite a few musicians that I like that aren't universally popular. However, they're enjoyed by people with similar tastes as I have - artists such as Wilco, for example. These are precisely successful because they tap into cultural influences with which I identify.\r\n\r\n\"Oops, I Did It Again,\" for all its technical competence, does not identify with me. I cannot appreciate it precisely because of the cultural barriers. I don't truly appreciate most West African art, either, though I know many people who do. It very well may be good art, but it doesn't resonate with me.\r\n\r\nAnd as such, cultural and sub-cultural references will always be a key component with art. One can separate the technical excellence, which can be judged by an expert, but it is a culture that resonates with a piece of art as much as an individual. (This explains why many abstract art pieces resonate with the cultural elite - the shared cultural framework has decided that these are culturally relevant, while most of us have not.) \r\n___\r\n\r\nAs a culture, we are interested with other questions than accurate paintings because they are solved problems. Not only do photographs do a much better job of an accurate portrayal than a portrait artist, but all of those pieces of the human that Leonardo and Michaelangelo discovered (along with Donatello and Raphael... sorry) were novel. Michaelangelo was slicing up humans to see how they worked and that close proximity made his art more realistic than others around him. (fact check - I think it was Michaelangelo who was buying cadavers against the Church's taste!) Now, you can take a course on how to do portraits, and you have thousands of examples and experts on which to draw. The masters were precisely masters because they discovered how to do it. They blazed the trail.\r\n\r\nI can find you a thousand artists with more technical skill than Leonardo. I can show you people who could repaint _The_Last_Supper_ and do it better. However, it was the greatness of Leonardo that allowed him to do it first.\r\n___\r\n\r\nAs such, what will move an individual is truly subjective - even those with taste are influenced by cultural variables. While technical competence is significant, it is the cultural indicators with which one attaches. That is not to say that a blank canvas is equal or greater than the Mona Lisa, but rather that art has three components - the technical, the cultural relevance, and the innovation, and is best judged on these merits. The idea of beauty as inherent just doesn't hold.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23947-0a94a0da-042e-4b15-84f3-11d6bb34c57b-1566236767"}

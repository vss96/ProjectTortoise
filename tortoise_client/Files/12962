Is it that  858+ redditors are largely new users since this was last posted, is it that the article was voted down by group voting and buried from the general populace before they had a chance to see it, is it that large parts of the community has changed their perspective on this since it was originally posted, is it that this sub-discussion and other comments on the thread are interesting enough to boost its score extra high?

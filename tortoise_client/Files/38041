You seem to be thinking this is about identifying a computer (it's not).\r\n\r\nThe linked paper shows that you can detect the system load of a system, by it's clock skew.\r\n\r\nIt is then pointed out that if you know there is a hidden service run on one of a set of systems, then you can identify which one by spiking the load on the hidden service, and examining the clock skew.\r\n\r\nYou seem to be confusing the place where clock skew is measured - it's nothing to do with Tor, but is in a seperate system.\r\n\r\nIn order to be practical, this would have to be combined with some other technique that gives a set of possible hosts (even a simple mapping of the Tor network, if possible, would probably be suficent).  Nothing in the report suggests oterhwise.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809639,"gilded":0,"id":"cweee","parent_id":"t1_cwbem","edited":false,"author":"syntax","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57584-402844ce-d6e8-46df-bcd4-7b3b72fe7f56-1566236779"}

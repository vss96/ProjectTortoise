Point of view doesn't mean \"opinion\" here. It means [{x|x âˆˆ first, second, third} person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_%28literature%29). It is confusing to change between these. e.g. I wouldn't say \"Fnord123 is trying to explain this stuff to you. I hope you understood\". That's poor. I should stick with the third person (Fnord123) or first person (I).\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vqj5","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166809290,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":13,"ups":13,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45755-53e05c5c-479f-4387-a27d-e7597e0db67a-1566236775"}

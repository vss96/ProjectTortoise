If you still want to call that chords from the same piece of music, you're allowed that opinion, but I disagree.\r\n\r\nPlus, if you're willing to reduce chords that much to say they're the same, then there are actually very few possible chord progressions in the western tonal system.  If you're reducing chords that much and calling them the same then, barring any unusual dissonant chords, you can only say there are about 3 possible chords that music can use, major, minor, and (EDIT: dominant 7th).  Now if I'm doing my math correctly, that means you're saying that for all songs with 4 chords in them, there are only 4^3, or 64 different songs that could possibly be written.  \r\n\r\nConsidering that there are probably at least 1,000 songs that get some amount of popularity every year, and that this person is selecting songs over the span of a couple of decades, if you're willing to call such disparate sounding chords as the same reduced chord then it shouldn't be the least bit surprising that there are 13 songs from the past 20 years that you could consider being part of the same highly reduced generic structure.\r\n\r\nBut in my opinion he's calling lots of things a duck that actually look like a cow or barks like a dog.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Clarified a couple of points that some people were misinterpreting.  And to clarify one more thing, the whole point of my comment is to point out how the way that this guy is reducing chords and calling them the same is NOT a fair analysis.  That's why I showed that the way that he's doing things only allows for 64 possible chord progressions, when obviously in reality there are many more, and thus disproving the validity of his false chord matching through over reduction.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tn3v","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1165313879,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8640-9eb97139-3c7d-4d1d-888b-fd020ce9ece8-1566236760"}

Certainly, you can make the argument that competence in several martial arts provides fewer gaps in your skill set. As someone who observes several, but trains in only one martial art, I'm troubled by students that take a cafeteria approach. They never get truly good at any single art and seem prone to make crucial errors as they try to mix skills from different sets. I like to believe that most martial arts, taken to a high-enough skill level tend to reveal the same truths about human interaction in conflict. Isn't it equally possible that expertise in one martial art can serve you well so long as your aware of your arts strengths and weaknesses?","retrieved_on":1473809225,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvsiz","parent_id":"t1_cvpla","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ewokjedi","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46309-982a1031-7ea8-47fd-b75a-59038cc6a9e6-1566236775"}

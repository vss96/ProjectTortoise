The couple we invited (husband and wife) after spending hundreds of dollars for visa application and waiting in line (in embassy) for the whole day they were turned away with no explanation or advice how they could visit USA. \r\n\r\nThey probably could be classified as middle class in US, have good jobs, not interested in staying in US.  As far as I know their experience is typical --- for Russian to get non-immigrant (tourist) visa to U.S. is extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nCan I call this country my new home if I can not invite my friends over?\r\n","retrieved_on":1473807492,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ct8mq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t7nt","author_flair_text":null,"author":"agoldin","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1363-e5c7a1b3-0742-45bd-900b-b4f617d59c51-1566236758"}

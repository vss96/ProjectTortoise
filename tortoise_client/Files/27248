When you are able to bring together hundreds of millions of dollars of investment money to build a city from scratch you can build it however you want to.  I'm sure you have put as much thought into it as they have collectively.  Do you think that this was built by a bunch of rich-kid sheik brats rather than pragmatic businessmen?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I love the design.  They had a unique opportunity to build a city from nothing but sand using all the latest technologies, and there is no where else like it in the world.  It's foolish to think it will die in 40 years.  In fact, most of it's revenue is from tourism and non-oil businesses so they have a pretty good idea of what kind of money the city will generate, and hence how long it will last.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wcfe","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1167422755,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57363-97b6ac2f-03a5-48a0-becd-4623a869b0cb-1566236779"}

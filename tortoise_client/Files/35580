{"body":"Python sucks less (tm) than many other languages but it has two major problems, both related to performance:\r\n\r\n1. It's sloooow\r\n2. Even worse, the GIL is per process!\r\n\r\nThe GIL as it stands is a major mistake in the era of multicore processors.  It doesn't matter if you use multiple interpreters, not only because most of the C-GIL-interface doesn't expect it, but because there are global variables used by Python (and some libs).\r\n\r\nIf you spawn new threads, even in C, they all still share the same GIL.  So, for the moment, forget thread threads -- if you want two processes to be able to operate on the same object at the same time, you have to serialize it and de-serialize it every time a different process wants it!  Yeah, that's super fast.\r\n\r\nLisp compiles to roughly half C speed.  Which implementation supports threading?  I mean really supports, not \"experimental\" buggy crashy stuff.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t1qf","subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1164949702,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lemmikins","parent_id":"t1_ct1qo","edited":false,"id":"ct6xo","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807461,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"596-38db5396-1a8d-44bb-945d-666102aa0d22-1566236758"}

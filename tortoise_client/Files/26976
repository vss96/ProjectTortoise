The idea is that you want close locations to have similar postal codes. Problem is, these codes are sequential and one-dimensional (why? never could figure that out), but geography has a distinct two-dimenional twang to it. So how do you marry the two? Fractals.

However, I doubt US ZIP codes knowingly used fractals.","created_utc":1165363619,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctrnm","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tptt","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Megasphaera","retrieved_on":1473807849,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10250-eac2e3dd-7539-4229-ae14-d498efd2b185-1566236761"}

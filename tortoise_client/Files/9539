You can't innovate if you don't have experience with manufacturing\r\n\r\n2. We're outsourcing most of our manufacturing to other countries\r\n\r\n3. Therefore, we'll soon stop being innovative\r\n\r\nI think this conflates two definitions of manufacturing: for (1), any kind will do -- including some guy tinkering in his garage. For (2), we're talking about mass production.\r\n\r\nThink about clothing -- it's mostly made in China or some third-world country these days, at least the stuff most people buy. But the fashion designers have their stuff made with much more expensive first-world labor. It means that they can't compete on price, but they're the ones innovating. As long as they're making stuff -- even if it's too expensive to sell well -- they have something to draw their inspiration from.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166936891,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48190-033c0b62-5d71-4c3a-a010-35797b72be54-1566236777"}

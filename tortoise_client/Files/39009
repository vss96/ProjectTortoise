A virtual gamma ray created by the Casimir effect, if it has sufficient energy, can turn into a virtual electron and positron pair that will annihilate and emit a virtual gamma ray that goes back into the void.\r\n\r\nHowever that's irrelevant to what he said, and the science in his comment is comlpetely and totally flawed. In fact, the complete opposite would be closer to reality. The exchange of particles was just a way of explaining it, and it couldn't be thurther from the truth.\r\n\r\nIf two pieces of metal are placed next to each other there is an unequal balance of pressure on them. In the vacuum you have masses of low energy virtual photons in the radio, microwave, light, etc. range that if you place the conductor plates together a few nanometres apart then they'll stop them being able to form. It's like getting a 1m wide block and trying to put it in a hole 1cm wide.\r\n\r\nThis means you have a net positive pressure on the outside, causing the two objects to attract to each other. Before anyone comes claiming zero-point energy, it takes the exact same amount of energy (if not more) to seperate the two pieces as it takes to get them together. It's just like gravity or magnetism, you get just as much energy going in as you do coming out.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vb4k","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38090-137f736a-5d55-4ffa-b630-e56792419692-1566236772"}

{"body":"100 Airbus A-380s painted psychedelically with your name all over.  \r\n\r\nOne one hand, he's accelerating the value of his company and his self worth.  I remember back in the summer he turned down $750 million stating that he felt Facebook.com was worth $1.5 billion.  Now he's been offered that and I suppose he doesn't have anything holding him back from asking for more.  I suppose there is a first for everything on the internet and the first being performed here is the creation of a spoiled brat worth multiple billions of dollars in valuation.\r\n\r\nI think Zuckerberg is doing the right thing, however.  I know that the creators of Hotmail sold out for a mere $400 million in the late nineties only to learn later that MS was willing to pay as much as $1 billion for the fledgeling business.  While this does not necessarily justify Zuckerberg's choice, it is quite a compelling argument to keep on asking, \"how much further can I push it?\"\r\n\r\nAs Facebook gathers more upward momentum (especially from news releases such as this), it will gain more valuation.  Afterall, if I were still in college, you can bet Yahoo!'s dollars that I'd sign up if I weren't already a member just to see what the (self-generated) hype is all about.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vw3y","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":13,"ups":13,"created_utc":1166936608,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"kloidster","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvw9u","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvw98","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809297,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48184-f9b83711-b393-4fa4-a3ef-54ac78bef4ca-1566236777"}

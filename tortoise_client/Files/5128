You simply have it classify a story as generally good or generally bad for a stock, and you can do this automatically, train the classifier for each stock and do it based on the direction the stock goes in a day, week, month or year. The classifier will eventually learn what makes a story generally good or generally bad for a stock.\r\n\r\nYou then supply the resulting Bayesian classifications along with the standard stock statistics to a set of genetic algorithms, give them a historical 2D array of numbers to feed on for each stock.\r\n\r\nIt's a lot of data and a lot of processing but it can pretty much be automated.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165876269,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuh4f","id":"cuhso","author_flair_text":null,"author":"css1971","retrieved_on":1473808338,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23400-8647da62-fe18-4e36-b947-424416f4218f-1566236766"}

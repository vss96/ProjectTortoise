{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t4dt","controversiality":0,"body":"Many economists will tell you that the dollar has long been overvalued.  The result of this is too many imports and too few exports:  our ever-decried trade imbalance.\r\n\r\nAn expensive dollar is great for tourists and importers but bad for American companies trying to sell their goods overseas.  If you're one of those types that gets all hot and bothered about outsourcing or the loss of American manufacturing, a weaker dollar is the cure for your woes.  I think talking about a \"weak\" dollar confuses people into thinking it's necessarily bad for Americans, but it isn't.\r\n\r\nEurope is getting royally screwed by this, though.  The dollar should also be sinking against Asian currencies, but isn't.  Asian countries like exporting to the US so much that their governments go to great lengths to keep the dollar expensive relative to their currencies, to make it easy for Americans to buy Asian goods.  So basically the people getting hurt most by the weaker dollar are Europeans.  Their exports to America are hurt and they don't get the advantage of cheaper consumer goods from Asia.  They get cheaper imports from America, but most basic manufactures don't come from here anymore.  It's like the big structure of the world economy is based around Asia and the US with Europe as an afterthought.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's way oversimplified of course.  But I've seen a lot of talk in the blogs about how a weaker dollar is somehow a symptom of a bad American economy.  It actually could be the sign of an economy on the mend, undergoing a needed correction.  By itself, it doesn't really signify one way or the other.  (And I'm not sure if the artificial currency conditions relative to Asia are good or bad for America or Asia.  And I have no idea how it plays out with American companies that have stuff manufactured in Asia, like Apple.)\r\n","score":9,"ups":9,"created_utc":1164945044,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ct6q2","parent_id":"t3_t4dt","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807456,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"482-67029388-47e7-486c-abdf-e1fb86d9c76c-1566236758"}

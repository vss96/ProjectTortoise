We have only managed to stay on the basic peak oil projected curve *because* of technologoy increases.  Without that, we would have peaked quite a while before Hubbert predicted.\r\n\r\n&gt;All we need is to build the FACTORIES, which is a big initial cost, but then the cost of oil from coal (which we have RIDICULOUS amounts of)\r\n\r\nIf you want to talk about over-simplification, look no further.  You ignore energy in-energy out efficiency considerations, and even if we have \"ridiculous\" amounts of coal, it is unlikely to be enough to offset the loss of oil, which we can retrieve at a nearly 1:40 ratio (ie, 1 unit of energy invested yields 40 as output).  Converting coal to oil ranges up to 1:5.  Which roughly means your rate of production of coal will have to be 8 times as great as your rate of production of oil.  I don't think that plan will work out as wonderfully as you seem to think.\r\n\r\nEDIT: correction, you don't need 8x as much coal to equal the oil, but rather 25% more, tx to cameldrv for pointing that out.","link_id":"t3_tyxw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14244-e55abfa7-ea9a-4d41-8bd5-11c2468b8c63-1566236762"}

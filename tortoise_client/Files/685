The United States is widely regarded as an arrogant source of instability, blamed for many global woesâ€”from greenhouse gases to Islamic militancy to unpopular globalization. No one can know what will replace Pax Americana, but with time, the people who now celebrate its decline may conclude that its failures were mainly those of good intentions and that its successes were unwisely taken for granted.    \r\n\r\nThe 'Why's' are mostly obvious. I find the question whether the decline is a *good* thing far more interesting.

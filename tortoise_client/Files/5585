{"body":"There is this thing called an 'alter call'. You see it at events where Christian speakers (such as Billy Graham and others) speak to a huge crowd of people, -- and then you see *TENS OF THOUSANDS* come forward to accept Christ as savior. These people become Christians at this event, and were NOT Christians before. The majority of these people also happen to be adults.\r\n\r\nNow, how did the early church start? Because the parents taught their kids, who taught their kids, etc? No! The early church started when Paul went to the Greeks CONVERTING people of PAGAN beliefs -- who were RAISED in those beliefs as kids. Your idea that someone is only a Christian because they are raised Christian is simply invalid. Christianity exists 2,000 years later *BECAUSE* of the tens of thousands of new converts *EVERY SINGLE MONTH*.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ua04","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":0,"score":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165789396,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"CarlH","id":"cud4x","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cucz6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808251,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20908-48101311-63a4-4c4c-b275-f278184b4a8d-1566236765"}

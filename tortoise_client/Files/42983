I'm trying not to give the knee jerk reaction that comes with having your Religion made a mockery of, so bear with me. I don't think that it should matter what religion someone belongs to. Mormons have good values, and try to live to high standards. That should mean something, if at the very least dedication. If I choose to believe in Joseph Smith, then thats my right. Because Mitt Romney has the same belief, does that automatically make you want to vote against him?\r\n\r\nI can understand the objection to a Mormon president, but criticizing us and basically saying we fell for a conman? I think thats taking it a little to far.\r\n\r\nOh, another disclaimer: I don't bash other religious people for there beliefs. I don't bash Atheists or Pastafarians either.","controversiality":0,"score":13,"ups":13,"created_utc":1166734286,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvofk","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vnhg","author":"HeliumHigh","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809148,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44191-44b5efdf-11c8-4e5d-a408-9a5c5d109ce4-1566236774"}

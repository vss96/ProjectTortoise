Let's say 100,000 bushels. The government takes 40,000 of those bushels, in the form of taxes. It then gives the corn away -- 5000 bushels to Social Security, 4500 bushels to war, etc.\r\n\r\nFarmer Sue figures out a clever new way to grow corn, and she spends more time working in the fields. As a result, she harvests 1,000,000 bushels of corn.\r\n\r\nPeople start complaining about the \"corn gap\" -- why should Sue have so much more corn than Bob? And what if Bob works as hard as he can, but he's just not as good a farmer as Sue? Despite all his efforts, he only harvests 150,000 bushels the next year -- while Sue gets a whopping 1,500,000, because her land happens to be especially fertile that year. But poor Bob worked just as hard and got less -- he's just not as good at generating corn.\r\n\r\nIs that a problem? Should Sue give some of her corn to Bob? If not, why is it different when we replace farmers with cubicle workers and corn with dollars?\r\n\r\nNow, if corn wasn't grown, but instead the Magical Corn Fairy came down from the mountain and conjured up a pile of corn in the town square each year, *then* it would make sense to talk about a fair way of distributing that corn.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27500-11dab295-b0a2-49d9-a15a-e03c115d1e52-1566236768"}

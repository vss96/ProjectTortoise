Oh wait, we are talking about a 10 point scale here, yes?\r\n\r\nAnd your little equation is crap. There's two kinds of humour. Put-down humour and absurdism. This comic is supposed to be absurd. But why is it supposed to be absurd? Because of the underlying assumption that human beings or the world we inhabit, is organized along rational lines.\r\n\r\nThis might be a common assumption among Americans who are mostly insane bible-humpers. It is of course a rediculous assumption for sane people who must recognize the reality that neither human thought nor the human body, let alone reality, are organized along rational lines.\r\n\r\nThere is another alternative. It is possible that the comic is funny because it is put-down humour against all human beings. The only problem with it is that the processes of concise interpretation and trying to strengthen weak connections by flushing the neural network with random signals, are nothing to laugh about. The first is inherent in any thinking machine, the second is inherent in any creative effort. You're laughing at intelligence and creativity. And that's not funny, it's vaguely offensive.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wbt3","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":-3,"score":-3,"created_utc":1167448324,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58061-b0f0b268-8e5b-40ad-b981-ceb15ffcb238-1566236780"}

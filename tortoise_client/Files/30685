Chile had an absurdly unequal distribution of wealth and property in the years before Allende.  Land-owning farmers and ranchers such as your uncles, like other moneyed aristocrats all over the world, were happy to rule quite brutally, maintaining an awful status quo.  Most of the big industries (such as copper mines, etc.) in Chile were owned by big foreign companies with the cooperation of the local elite, and their profits went to American corporations.\r\n\r\n2.  Chile's economic failures during Allende's presidency were exacerbated by the actions of the United States, who cut off aid, and then dumped copper onto the market, dropping the price of Chile's chief export by more than 25%.  Washington wanted Allende out, and did everything possible to make Chile fail while he was in office.  Admittedly, Allende's monetary policy wasn't the smartest, and ended up leading to rampant inflation, but rather than helping out, the US was happy happy happy at this development.\r\n\r\n    Also worth noting is that the US dumped tons of aid back into Chile as soon as Pinochet came to power.  The short-term economic success after Pinochet's return to power can be attributed to, among other factors, this aid from Washington, and also to the money injected in the economy from selling off all of the nation's assets (selling back the copper industry, the banks and hospitals,  the national pension system, etc.).  These policies successfully reigned in inflation, but at the same time had some nasty long-term side effects that particularly Chile's elderly are still suffering from today.\r\n\r\n3. Pinochet was a terrible, brutal fascist.  He crushed opposition, \"disappearing\" and torturing dissidents, shutting down independent voices, etc. etc.\r\n\r\n4. The claim that US anti-Allende influence was matched by pro-Allende Cuban influence is absurd.  Sure, Cuba was happy to see the success of socialism in Latin America, but it's silly to suggest that the Cubans had as much power as the Americans.  That the US backs fascist dictators with money and legitimacy all over the world is bad enough.  That we Americans actively worked to destroy a functioning democracy because we were afraid it would make agrarian reform and redistributionist policy look good, instead preferring a murdering fascist scumbag, is shameful.\r\n\r\nI wish that America wasn't still supporting terrible and tyranical crooks like Pinochet all over the world (people like Musharraf, the Saudis, etc. etc.).  When it comes to Latin America, it seems that pushback against terrible US economic advice (of the 80s and 90s) has brought leaders like Brazil's Lula to power.  Hopefully this round of populist leaders with socialist leanings won't step on Washington's toes so much, and may have a chance to survive and help their people, rather than being crushed by military coups.","link_id":"t3_uc9i","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165905733,"score":4,"ups":4,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24258-d3c3201d-2fc4-4a64-9ea3-01b5be6fc42b-1566236767"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"The MBTI is meant to be a reflection of your inner or \"true\" self. Take the test from the viewpoint of your job or your role as a student and you'll probably receive a different result than if you think about the questions in ways that only pertain to your innate way of relating to the world. The American school system and the corporate world both value the ESTJ and ISTJ types -- rational/logical thinkers who are punctual and follow set rules (on average, that is).  I'm an INFP, but if I take the MBTI test from the viewpoint of my job (web designer), my results start skewing to the INTJ type. \r\n\r\nBut beyond all that... I thought that this test was supposed to relate the results in some way to computer programmers?","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ue7v","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165854461,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"box543","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cug72","parent_id":"t3_ue7v","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808308,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22512-01c40d2a-6ba5-4cc0-bce9-d910e969dc0b-1566236766"}

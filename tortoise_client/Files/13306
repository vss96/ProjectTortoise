So when the new version of Foobar comes out anyone interested finds out about it. Any changes to interfaces are particularly carefully controlled, so I can easily tell if the Foobar people have done anything to break my application. If they have I can carry on depending on the previous version until I can resolve the problem. Then before my application finds its way into, say, Fedora, it has to be integrated into an explicit dependency graph and checked for conflicts with anything else.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if anyone thinks the same way, but isn't that kind of rose-colored? Ideally, we'd all check in and make sure our programs don't break when a new version of -blah- comes out, but that never quite happens in the real world, right?","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_txsw","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808017,"author":"cal_01","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_txsw","id":"cu0mz","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14351-0b56853e-8e92-4022-a5d8-ec2a50287e40-1566236762"}

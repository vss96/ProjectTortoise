That could have been $210 million in profits. Paying them that amount won't retain them, these bums flit around changing jobs more often than some emo college kid. And if anyone was willing to do the experiment and we could arrange some type of controls, we'd discover that whether or not you hired the hotshot CEO, your company would do just as well.\r\n\r\nThat is, when the CEO isn't boosting profits by selling it out in the long run.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167233143,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cw5j3","parent_id":"t3_w5g4","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809471,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53000-5dd66f1e-bc87-4dd4-be1f-9f0810c06589-1566236778"}

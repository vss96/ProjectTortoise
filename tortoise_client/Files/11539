Denturist are dealing with the same thing across the U.S., as if the dentist don't have enough work doing preventive, restorative, and cosmetic dentistry. In most cases it take a month or two for an appointment to see a good dentist. We denturist know it's a turf issue and the few dentist willing to make trouble with the denturist is usually of the less ethically inclined.\r\nI was shut down by the Wyoming dental board in October 2006 and I've practiced here since 1992. I'm also a graduate of George Brown's IDEC program. Excellent program and my hats off to Mr. Mike Vakalis and associates. Lets organize through IFD, International Federation of Denturist, www.international-denturist.org  Thank you for your consideration. Gary W.

{"body":"&gt;It seems that your tipically American obsession with character development\r\n\r\nLOL\r\n\r\n&gt;You don't seem to read much genre literature in school, and in general action, sci-fi and fantasy are derided in mainstream, middle-class LitCrit circles.\r\n\r\nAmazing, it's like you don't even know what I've read, what I've been taught, what I like, or even where I'm from! Oh wait, you don't.\r\n\r\n&gt;Turgidity is a proper attribute of style, not of plot\r\n\r\nYeah, as if plot has never had a style associated with it. Wait, don't answer that. I like literature but not enough to really get into a discussion over what constitutes 'style', especially in reference to a Cory Doctorow novel.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tnlk","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165557404,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rafuzo2","id":"cu2wa","parent_id":"t1_ctrzn","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808057,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15460-92ef4e91-ae59-4d90-800b-30c60c36d21d-1566236762"}

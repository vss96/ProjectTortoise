Bush is a horrible leader: he loves \"yes-men\", who say what he wants to hear, when he wants to hear it.\r\n\r\nThere are amazing men in this world, who are genuine, competent, and moral. They're usually ignored and considered \"difficult\" and not \"team players\", by the morons that frequently end up in power.\r\n\r\nWe just need a leader who can utilize the resources we have in an effective un-biased way.

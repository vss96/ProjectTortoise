I am currently using Eclipse as my IDE with the Visual Editor(VE) plugin to do GUI layouts and if I open up a source code file in the VE I get (for some absurd reason) two JVMs per file.  Once I've opened two or three of these files, my Powerbook becomes so bogged down that to make even a simple change is a full lesson in anger management--I believe the other patrons at Starbucks are beginning to believe that I have turrets or something.

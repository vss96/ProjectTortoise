I am a life member of the NRA as is my father, and I have yet to receive one or even hear about it from them.  I will be on the lookout for one and if I do receive one, then I will confirm it - maybe with another post here on reddit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomehow, though, I don't think I will.  Having known the organization for so long thru my father and now being a member myself, I can state with great confidence that this is FAR from what the NRA is really about.  Therefore, I'm betting this thing is a hoax.","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167353859,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_w7hi","id":"cwb6c","edited":false,"author":"wk2x","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809579,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55959-73a4c4e4-0fd0-4353-b866-81ccbe136549-1566236779"}

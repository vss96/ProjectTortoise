{"controversiality":0,"body":"Because it is a beautiful concept, and you have faith that the implementations do or will live up to it.\r\n\r\nBecause you don't like to be told what your syntax has to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause it's fun.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nSeriously though, it is somewhat like asking, \"Why pizza?\".    \r\nThere are features of the thing, then there are how much those features matter to you. The first is easy to find online (check out \"Practical Common Lisp\" or \"On Lisp\" or one of the billion newsgroup/reddit posts). The second can only come with experience and is a subjective matter. For that, one reasonably sized program will teach you more than a hundred 'Ask Reddit's.\r\n\r\nAdvocates talk up Lisp like it is the best thing ever. It's not. It's a programming language. It is better than some languages at many things, but many languages are better than it at things. No big deal, that's the nature of programming languages. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, I similar to \"Why (Emacs|Vim|Linux|Jesus)?\": it stirs up a fairly stale pot, and not much good is likely to result. However, many find this kind of discussion interesting because they haven't seen it a few hundred times yet. If that be the case, I recommend most everything on http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?CategoryLisp. comp.lang.lisp is also a source for this kind of debate and Lambda The Ultimate addresses typing issues pretty comprehensively. \r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w6m0","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1167251298,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":3,"score":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"doubtingthomas","edited":false,"id":"cw6mi","parent_id":"t3_w6m0","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809494,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53644-f139b351-509e-4db6-867a-1b7ae50e4dcd-1566236778"}

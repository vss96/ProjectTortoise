This is a very different case from USA, which is a country of immigrants. Estonia is clearly a nation-state where people define their identity through nationality (Japan would be a similar example); USA and e.g. France are countries where saying \"I'm American\" or \"I'm French\" mostly refers to citizenship.\r\n\r\nAmerican culture is one defined and crafted through immigrants and this merger, amalgamation of many different cultural origins. In Estonia, culture and language are probably more seen as precious heritage which a small amount of people have managed to preserve and cherish through centuries and millennia.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, language and culture are very much personal matters which I don't think should even be seen as social institutions. Everyone is free to speak whichever language they wish and practice their own culture. But I do believe that 5000 years of heritage is something Estonians are justified to be conservative about. Now we have the huge privilege of our own sovreign, independent country; a privilege that very many nationalities in this world do not have.\r\n\r\nYou must understand that there is a fundamental difference between nation states and non-nation states when discussing these issues, keep that in mind when judging my opinions.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v7fq","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":13,"ups":13,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166499510,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37459-69950676-145f-4bf2-96eb-89378dd32335-1566236772"}

{"link_id":"t3_twhc","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"I'm not in favour of cruel forms of punishment, but I do think that we are increasingly scared of disciplining our kids, starting when they are toddlers. Perhaps we need to be tougher. Certainly children need rights, and the rights we give them are screwed up, but that doesn't mean we also need to give children the right to run their own lives. That's what parents were invented for.\r\n\r\nHis mom was worried about her kid's future - nothing but a cold sharp shock was going to deter him from his downward spiral and she got zero help in the US. I doubt any help he would have recieved would have worked anyway. \r\n\r\nHer method is perhaps slightly cruel and definitely unusual and perhaps she had blown her chances earlier in his life. Leaving him behind is shocking, but come on, the kid needed something drastic. How else would you suggest she deal with his behaviour? Clearly he was incapable of making the right decisions and she was forced to make this one for him. It's a parent's job to make the decisions for their kids that kids do not have the sense or experience to make themselves. She at least had the sense and the decency not to send him to be turned into a religious robot at an off-shore bootcamp.\r\n\r\nAnd imagining a role reversal, well, my parents did things to me that seemed cruel to my overblown teenage sense of drama, but which were intended to keep me out of trouble. I'm glad they did them because a 40 year old parent has more sense than a 16 or even 20 year old kid. Shacking up with a convicted bank robber seemed perfectly reasonable to me at 20, and only threat of being cut off from my family forever made me see sense. \r\n\r\nThis story probably comes over entirely differently to people who have kids. If you see your kid doing something dangerous, you'll do anything you can to stop him. What most parents want for their kids is that they turn into happy, well-adjusted (grandchild producing) adults; they'll sometimes go to great lenghts to ensure this outcome. This mom is amazingly brave and her son, rather than feeling deprived, will be grateful his whole life that she sent him away.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165487434,"score":12,"ups":12,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctymj","parent_id":"t1_cty01","author":"pootler","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473807978,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13511-da6f35ce-0f42-4ad1-b7f2-497f59390cb8-1566236762"}

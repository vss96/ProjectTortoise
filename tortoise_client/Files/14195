The first person to realise that light enters the eye, rather than leaving it, was the 10th-century Muslim mathematician, astronomer and physicist Ibn al-Haitham. He invented the first pin-hole camera after noticing the way light came through a hole in window shutters. The smaller the hole, the better the picture, he worked out, and set up the first Camera Obscura (from the Arab word qamara for a dark or private room). He is also credited with being the first man to shift physics from a philosophical activity to an experimental one.\r\n\r\nFirst, 'camera' is a Latin word, apparently derived from the Greek 'kamara'.\r\n\r\nNext (despite the wikipedia article!), the camera obscura was mentioned by Aristotle, a millenium before the Arab dude, and Euclid assumes it's existence in describing how light travels in straight lines.","ups":4,"score":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166448201,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35677-ec043d1e-eb12-4905-8b07-3a42ff28daa7-1566236771"}

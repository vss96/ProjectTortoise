Despicable. Particularly when the suspect didn't actually fire at a real deer. Poaching is illegal for a reason -- it causes damage to the environment, depleting the deer population. Firing at a robotic deer doesn't do this. It demonstrates that the perpetrator *intended* to poach, sure, but arresting them for that is bordering on punishing them for thoughtcrime.\r\n\r\nFrom the article:\r\n\r\nConvicted poachers have complained that using the decoys constitutes entrapment. But David Youngquist, of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, says it's all about safe, ethical hunting. \"How a hunter can be proud of a deer shot from the road in the day or at night is beyond me,\" he admits. \"But some people will do anything to get a big buck and to get a trophy.\"\r\n\r\nSo... he responds to a valid allegation by... completely changing the freaking subject? Or maybe it's the reporter's fault. The article completely fawns over the technique everywhere else.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52100-c840cccb-b3a0-4612-be78-a03c2dece1f3-1566236778"}

She did not mark essays on whether they agreed with her, but on how effectively they argued their thesis.\r\n\r\nI guess that's the difference between having an opinion and recognizing that it's an opinion, and having an opinion and unthinkingly believing it's God's Unvarnished Truth.\r\n\r\n*edited for spelling*","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v6h2","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36504-89ff569f-29cf-45f8-85e5-0e7c477379ec-1566236772"}

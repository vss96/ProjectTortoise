Yes, that means that his sentence would only be seven and a half years for murder. But think about how much you changed between the ages of 15 and 23 - can you really say that there's no chance he might?\r\n\r\nYes, I can. There is no chance worth taking. Is this the same as impossible? Hell no. Think of it this way. 1 out of 100... no, that's too unfair. 1 out of 20 kids like him can change in that amount of time. That means that for ever kid who made a mistake whose life we save by not having him live with hardened criminals for 25 years, we let 19 killers go free. 19 who will not change. And since one killer can easily have more than one victim, we have to have significantly more than 1 out of every 2 be redeemable.\r\n\r\nThis is common sense... I don't have a PhD in logic or a brain the size of a compact car. You too, can figure these things out, if you just type less and think more.\r\n\r\nAs for it being strawman... maybe so. Touche. Still. Tell us just what you do think befits it, other than a 7 year sentence. That's it? We lock people away for longer for less. I just don't see this helping... 7 years is easily long enough for a green sociopath to become seasoned. We're not saving him from the prison system unless we do away with it completely. Many men end up more dangerous after 7 years than they were before.\r\n\r\nAnd while I hate to use this argument because rightwing nuts use it far in excess of what it can justify, there is some truth to it that society's attitude towards punishment can affect whether crime is committed at all. Sweden used to be easy on kids who committed crimes, figuring that most teenagers were being mischievious and playing pranks than doing any real harm. For awhile that was true, even... at certain thresholds this response might be appropriate and keep things from escalating.\r\n\r\nBut, cultures change. A growing immigrant population (note: this isn't anti-immigrant, *any* change in culture, such as those occurring today among our youth, could easily thwart the strategy of leniency) took this to be a license to commit ever more notorious crimes.\r\n\r\n&gt;What matters is not ensuring things are as bad for him as possible, what matters is ensuring that things are as good for society as possible. Locking him up for the majority of his life not only costs the taxpayer money, but it prevents him from making a positive contribution to society.\r\n\r\nHis contribution to society? He's gonna cure cancer? Take a vow of poverty and teach people peace and love to try to atone? Even come up with a decent standup routine that'll make some yokels laugh for 20 minutes on cable TV? Give me a fucking break already. Even now, he has little concept of just what went wrong. The worst thing about it for him is that he's in prison. And it may make me a small man to take any kind of joy in it, but goddammit I do. If it's that tough for him, well I have this big fat smile on my face right now. It feels good.\r\n\r\n&gt;So why be so obnoxious?\r\n\r\nGood question. I choose not to be open about it, feel free to guess though.\r\n\r\nTo a smaller degree, I was pissed that someone would mod you down. That should only be used to get rid of the ijits not contributing to discussion.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_trhc","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807859,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cts6c","parent_id":"t1_cts13","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10533-29a13a84-f61b-4151-8bff-4c2a26cd4ced-1566236761"}

China may be growing faster, and we would expect it to.  I in no way think this is a bad thing.\r\n\r\nThink: we have already roughly saturated ourselves with technology, so we only get productivity gains when new technologies become available.  China has not saturated its production technology yet.  Hence, it should be able to grow much faster as technologies we had ten, thirty, or fifty years ago become widespread.\r\n\r\nIn any case, why is it a problem if China rises?  Once again, people are buying into the fallacy that if the other guy gains, you lose.  Whoever is writing these articles has an interesting motivation: stir up xenophobia and a sense of entitlement.  I'm tempted to ask if articles like these come more often from conservatives or liberals, but I realize it doesn't matter.  If they come seventy percent of the time from one camp and thirty from the other, we can still assure ourselves that the authors are 100% fool.  And that is the classification you need to be making.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vct7","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808939,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vct7","id":"cvdpk","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38736-b66c1130-6a08-4605-89ee-9461dd0dca5f-1566236773"}

At the invitation of the family, they ride out to funerals that Phelps has targeted and escort the families to the cemetery with as little harassment as possible. They also rev their engines to drown out the protester's yells and songs.\r\n\r\nA list of upcoming funerals that need escorts is on their web site.\r\n\r\nThey are not all veterans, they are not all pro-war, they are not really united by anything except the urge to do something about the Westboro Baptist Church's protests. They want to make it right. I like that.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wd7t","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58809-b8b8341d-a46c-4b39-bd62-4fd375581933-1566236780"}

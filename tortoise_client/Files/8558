{"body":"Besides the Saturnalia which was tied to the Winter Solstice the 25th of December was the official celebration of the birth of Mithras - a pagan god whose life story has elements very similar to the story of Jesus. Mithras was born on December 25th of a virgin, he was born in a cave, died for the sins of the world and was resurrected three days later to offer humanity salvation. He was called \"The Light of the World\", \"The Good Shepperd\", \"The Sacrificial Lamb\", \"The Lion\" etc. The tradition of the 25th of December is almost certainly carried over from Mithraism.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vybr","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167027664,"score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"grzelakc","edited":false,"id":"cvytz","parent_id":"t3_vybr","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809345,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49500-081f8f1a-b11e-431f-bb5a-75e2b796e3c1-1566236777"}

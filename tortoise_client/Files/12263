The code was housed on the Mac, but it never was demonstrated as running on the Mac that I recall.

Somehow it was much quicker to transmit it to the old space craft (older tech had more bandwidth? ;-). Heck, wouldn't these advanced aliens have some way to transmit code that would send a tiny virus in the blink of an eye?","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13234-9a43fa74-c861-4541-bc86-8f5ae7ad4617-1566236762"}

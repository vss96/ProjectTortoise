Actually, for particular domains, they are. Perhaps just like functional languages. I don't think the amount of 'inherent complexity' is that high in a 1000 line program.\r\n\r\nMore to the point, if they never actually ran the programs, well, I can write one-liner in *assembly* that will 'solve' the problem. Now there's silver bullet: No requirement that the program actually work!","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_twtt","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13520-5346d2ae-8556-40db-b2e5-c1f3e2b2d122-1566236762"}

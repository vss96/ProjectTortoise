This is frustrating for those who don't use a modified client and are competing for position with those who do.\r\n\r\nA successful wide-open MMORPG, with the heavily scriptable clients that would inevitably result, might make for a favorable evolution of the form. If all your repetitive, mindless game dynamics can be scripted around, maybe you'll come up with better game dynamics - or maybe the scripting itself will become a key part of gameplay, which would sure as shit be more interesting than hacking yet another monster to death.\r\n\r\nAs I type this, my girlfriend's kid brother has been sitting a few feet away playing WoW for hours. I look over his shoulder every once in a while, and sometimes I think gosh, that's pretty cool: Here's this huge, detailed world, beautifully rendered, and full of all these cool-looking entities. At the moment he's running up a path on some snow covered hill towards a burning fortress while some sort of bat-winged monstrosity rains fire down on his party. This is kind of neat, right? Except every time I start thinking along these lines, I notice what the gameplay actually consists of: Go kill something by clicking on it a lot, take its stuff. Lather, rinse, repeat.","link_id":"t3_v0jw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808745,"distinguished":null,"author":"brennen","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cv347","edited":false,"id":"cv3f4","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33611-2425a11e-8f68-429b-b7ae-6d5a1da47292-1566236771"}

Reddit's userbase has exploded since then -- only a fraction of us were even around back then. Judging by the fact that the new post got more than twice the votes the original did, a lot of people were glad i posted it.\r\n\r\nFor example, you had a good time participating in a thread on [this post](http://reddit.com/info/w23i/comments) .. i had to delete and resubmit that submission about nine times before it survived the larval stage. The first 8 times, it got 0 votes. The last time, it managed to make it off the \"New\" queue and went all the way to #2 or #3 with 172 votes. \r\n\r\nThat's what it takes to post something on Reddit these days.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167230905,"ups":10,"score":10,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cw5dc","edited":false,"id":"cw5e5","author_flair_text":null,"author":"raldi","retrieved_on":1473809468,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52929-f82f869f-1163-4f48-b125-cdd387771743-1566236778"}

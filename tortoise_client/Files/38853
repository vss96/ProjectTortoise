We don't want any heap-allocation going on unless the `new` keyword is used.\"  Similar issue with autoboxing - practicing programmers felt it would be too inefficient and nixed the idea.  And operator overloading - many practicing programmers *still* nix the idea, but for certain domains - scientific or financial computing, for instance - it's a huge hassle to not have it.

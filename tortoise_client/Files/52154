Bonus points for world problems pre-american revolution, and super-double bonus points for problems pre-1492.\r\n\r\n*Edit*: added it as a reddit submission:\r\n\r\nhttp://reddit.com/info/w3jo/comments","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51879-076afaf8-28c6-4a5f-92ea-acb02db593d6-1566236778"}

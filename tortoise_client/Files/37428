{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; Do you wish to have your viewpoints lumped together with those of every non-Christian?\r\n\r\nAs long as they are saying things I agree with, yes. Otherwise I will either have to speak out or live with what they are saying and that will probably depend on exactly what they are saying.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Are you responsible for speaking out loudly anytime anyone from a group you could be reasonably \r\n&gt; associated with does or says something stupid? \r\n\r\nResponsible no. But if I stay silent I risk that the stupid comment will reflect on me as a member of that group and what it stands for. \r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; With the amount of idiocy rampant in the world, that's a pretty high calling.\r\n\r\nAgreed. Lets take turns pointing out the stupid comments and even the load. After a while we won’t have to say “no the moon isn’t made of cheese” or “the earth isn’t 10,000 years old”. Eventually these ideas will become accepted by the vast majority of people as they understand and accept the evidence behind them. There are still people who claim the world is flat and I’d hazard to guess that they are regarded as misguided by the general public. We don’t need to correct their comments all the time but we also don’t knowingly let them teach science classes either. \r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Aren't you responding to a Christian who JUST DID speak out against the idiocy of someone who calls himself Christian? So you're kind of preaching to the choir in this case.\r\n\r\nPossibly but I suggest that a Christian who wants to speak out about this issue might want to do it on the front lines. For example, this [discussion](http://forums.kearnyontheweb.com/index.php?s=f6396ca9e9f2f0292172c3d2b23b5fe6&amp;showtopic=2955) was started by Matthew LaClair’s father Paul where he attempts to answer questions about this issue. There are many comments from Christian’s condemning Matthew’s actions. There are relatively few (but the numbers are increasing) comments from Christian’s saying they support Matthew and Paul.\r\n\r\nI remember watching a documentary a while back about moderate Muslim’s in America and the post 9/11 atmosphere. Their standard refrain was that they didn’t support the fundamentalist Muslim’s and were tired everyone assumed they thought the same. Yet they didn’t really speak out against *their* vocal minority. Similar problem, different religion.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v6h2","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166501290,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"author":"bluffy","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvb53","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cva8s","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808890,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37506-bb9647cf-7e0e-488d-bcb8-6b425995890e-1566236772"}

{"body":"you can't misunderestimate the hatred many Japanese feel for the Chinese and the Koreans, their closest neighbors.  Now look at the gradual weakening of the Japanese economy and the strengthening of the Chinese and South Korean economies, and look at the growing threat of North Korea, and you have the perfect recipie for a new nationalism.  I was in Japan last month and saw for the first time the WWII flag of Japan (like the normal flag but with red stripes coming from all sides of the red disc in the center) for sale openly in a gift shop in Kyoto.  I bought one for my nephew who collects flags and already has the Japanese flag.  Times are changing in Japan, they are very good at forgetting about WWII, and textbooks gloss over things like the Nanking Massacre.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wda1","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1167431678,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"weegee","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_wda1","id":"cwekf","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809643,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57690-786ff30d-3e3f-4872-af58-a3075758a101-1566236780"}

I'm doing the same thing for my web startup that I hope to launch in 2007. I've been working 4 years, nights and weekends, building an app in PHP4. I built it in PHP4 so that I could release it, get the widest audience to comment on it, and then move on to a PHP5 version that will be even better.\r\n\r\nI like to stick with a language that is most familiar to me. I got used to Java and C#, so PHP was similar in some ways to that for me, but easier and just fast enough. Also, the user base was large, the docs were more clear, and the libraries were rich. I also liked running my code instantly without worrying about compilation.\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167195465,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52337-d572631e-0c63-44af-8a84-23a1a1213b46-1566236778"}

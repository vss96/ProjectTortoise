Builders only construct more when they can sell the finished product for more than a used home will sell.\r\n\r\nPrefabs are *not* a good option, imo anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is a way to construct a quality home in just a matter of days.  But there's just so much involved in building a home and every step requires a contractor.  On top of that, each step has to be verified and ok'd by a government agent.  When it comes to actually hooking up to utilities, it's even worse.\r\n\r\nSomeday, maybe (probably never), I can imagine hiring a company to come to my empty home site, and pour a new house for me per design, including all plumbing, electrical, and wiring, as well as hooking up to the local utilities assuming the utilities are prepared.\r\n\r\nWell, actually I'd like to see not needing any local utilities except maybe water.  Home fusion system for power/heating, and some form of secure wireless for communications.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809512,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w4vh","id":"cw7ke","author":"nosoupforyou","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54171-914dcb8b-b1d4-40d4-b251-d28ca758e922-1566236779"}

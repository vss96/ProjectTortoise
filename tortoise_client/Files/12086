I was astonished at how fast the sliver wire disappeared. So yes, this \"never run dry\" pen will get worn down to a nub pretty quick.\r\n\r\nAlso silverpoint/metalpoint is very sensitive to the paper surface, most paper will not accept a mark, it needs to be fairly abrasive surface to get the metal particles off the point. Clay-coated photocopier paper is about the best surface (and in fact, they demo the metalpoint writing on copier paper).\r\n\r\nBut the worst part of metalpoint is that the drawing or writing is extremely faint, and it takes years for the metal particles to oxidize and tarnish so that the marks become dark. I have some 30 year old silverpoint drawings that are just now starting to become dark enough to see more than faint indentations in the paper.","controversiality":0,"score":28,"ups":28,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167522567,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59280-4b804161-406c-480a-9593-b40850550b38-1566236780"}

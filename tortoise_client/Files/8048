Oh, hold on, I see I worded it awfully.\r\n\r\nWhat I was trying to get across was that I was **not** trying to claim that NASA are a bunch of big old racists.  I'm positive they try to select the very best astronauts they can find.\r\n\r\nBut I think that it's not irresponsible to look at the mix of races in a prestigious, hard-to-enter group such as those with the opportunity and responsibility of carrying out space missions, as somehow informing us *something* (albeit anecdotally) about the extent to which racial integration carries throughout society as a whole.\r\n\r\nI'll say it again - when my kids blast off for the colony on Europa I damn well hope the race of their compatriots is irrelevant.  I'm afraid people haven't come quite far enough yet for us to consider race a non-issue; hence some vigilance is necessary.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808574,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cuuek","parent_id":"t1_cut0c","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29431-f518d471-dcaa-43a4-bcdd-cc3576dd396d-1566236769"}

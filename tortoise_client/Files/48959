The LSP doesn't give the dishes a second thought--they are after all no longer there; there is literally nothing there to think about. If the HSP starts nagging, the LSP thinks, \"Why are they making such a big deal? The place is clean.\"\r\n\r\nI had a LSP roommate once who used to leave all sorts of crap lying about that I used to pick up and put away or throw out (in the case of garbage). I couldn't help it. The desire not to live in squalor overpowered my reluctance to being a \"magical cleaning fairy\".\r\n\r\nAfter some time, after getting sick of doing that, I tried a social engineering experiment: instead of putting his stuff away, I transfered it into a special \"crap box\". I did that quietly, without making a big deal about it. I think that was important. If I had made a big deal, the situation might have become adversarial, and the experiment might not have worked.\r\n\r\nThe box quickly filled up, and it became obvious to the LSP himself that he really was a complete slob. It became visible to him. He did get much better after that.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vwe3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48613-cd2140c2-78bc-4ea4-9722-fce23be4cf1b-1566236777"}

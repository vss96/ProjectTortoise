Really?  Meh.  What a waste of tax dollars to draft this law and then prosecute it.  I mean these kids could be in the same classes in high school and it is a crime to have sexual contact?  \r\n\r\nStupid is the only word that comes to mind.  I don't see how such a statute could possibly benefit ANYONE in our society.  Legislatures need to cease trying to make laws to control intimate areas of people's lives and focus on REAL crime.\r\n\r\nAnd the jury here is responsible.  It is our civic duty to look out for one another in a civilized manner regardless of what the law is.  The law is not definite or correct or necessarily just and the jurors in this case should have easily been able to realize that this is one of those cases.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vcwe","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":25,"ups":25,"created_utc":1166546932,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38585-dbb290d2-dfb5-4b2c-94a7-6ff178a99b9c-1566236773"}

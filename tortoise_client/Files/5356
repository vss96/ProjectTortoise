At some point, the amount you are losing from having to do extra trades is swamped by the amount you are losing due to holding that money in the low-interest money market.

Presumably the interbank rates are 7 significant figures or more, leaving a bid/offer spread of less than 1:10^6.  For comparison, this is significantly less than daily interest rates of around 1:10^4.\r\n\r\nI suppose someone has gone to the trouble of analyzing accurately how many dollars actually are tied up in oil trading.

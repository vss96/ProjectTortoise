Among animal populations, generations of inbreeding frequently lead to the development of coadapted gene complexes, suites of genetic traits that tend to be inherited together. These traits may confer special adaptations to a local environment, like resistance to disease.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;   The evidence for such benefits in humans is slim, perhaps in part because any genetic advantages conferred by inbreeding may be too small or too gradual to detect. \r\n\r\nSo unless the species needs to adapt to extreme new circumstances, whether in nature or due to domestication of animals for specific extreme traits, risks far outweigh benefits. Makes sense.\r\n\r\nAfter reading that article, it's clear that it was titled so as to grab attention. In the end it made no real supporting argument.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tl3j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807758,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"ctmsd","parent_id":"t1_ctmq0","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7940-cc4e592e-97fc-4aea-b3a3-7ac6e1e2bbfd-1566236760"}

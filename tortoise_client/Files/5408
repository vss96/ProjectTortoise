So no, I don't live in a warm temperate climate.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't consider where I live to be \"natural\".  For most of human history, latitudes like my home were sparsely populated, precisely because winter is harsh when you've only got the clothes you can hunt or weave yourself.  \r\n\r\nAgain, I think that analyzing this in terms of \"naturalness\" is silly.  There's a reason that humans evolve - what's \"natural\" isn't necessarily what's good, and since intelligence and cultural evolution itself naturally, you could argue that it's all \"natural\".","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59449-66df1fb7-3278-4c01-b01a-e252318ade4b-1566236780"}

And it’s a cramped vision of girlhood that enshrines sexual allure as the best or only form of power and esteem. It’s as if there were now Three Ages of Woman: first Mary-Kate, then Britney, then Courtney. Boys don’t seem to have such constricted horizons. They wouldn’t stand for it — much less waggle their butts and roll around for applause on the floor of a school auditorium.\r\n\r\nYet at the same time, we have concerns about boys like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10965522/site/newsweek/\r\n\r\nBoys falling behind academically, socially, etc.  Could young girls' newly bold sexual expression be instead a symptom of their new social freedom?  Across the board it seems women are doing well these days, and it's only a matter of time b/f women CEOs and politicans are at least numerous as men.  Maybe this increased sexual expressiveness is simply part and parcel of changing social roles for women in general?  I mean, news flash, most women like sex, and like to be sexy, only now they can finally admit and do something about it.  Perhaps they're overdoing it a bit, though.\r\n\r\nIf anything, this story indicates that the real problem is that young girls have unimaginative role models cough*britney*cough*paris*cough who reinforce a one-dimensional concept of sexiness.  Sexy is not just showing off your bod and acting loose, it also has strong psychological, emotional (and even intellectual for those so inclined) aspects.  Girls who don't understand that are short-changing themselves.\r\n\r\nOn another note, schools should be teaching enduring knowledge, not pop culture anyway.  One more reason to homeschool - rear children who are informed, independent, critical thinkers instead of wanna-be entourage groupies.\r\n\r\nAnd btw, who's Courtney?","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809645,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cwenx","parent_id":"t3_wdrb","author":"fbg111","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57744-d75070d0-4510-446d-b128-6917a0b64e3d-1566236780"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"That's exactly my point.  Current leaders trump old ones.  If current leaders repudiate older doctrine (which they have) or simply reject it by ignoring it (by not including it in lesson manuals, for example) then it's not the doctrine of the LDS church.  So to answer, \"what do Mormons believe\" you have the take the current snapshot of beliefs.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to defend Mormon beliefs.  I'm trying to clarify what they actually are today.  And by the way, no one said Mormonism (or any religion for that matter) is 100% consistent.  It isn't.  Deal with it.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ud3o","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165850733,"author":"farra","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cufwv","parent_id":"t1_cufm8","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808302,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22389-48a4b2cb-ba7c-4d4c-82e5-9b2c352bbe06-1566236766"}

Click on the \"Certification\" link on the left, then pick the one you like.  You mentioned welder, so let's look at a welding engineer.  WHAT?? You mean I have to have a BS just to take the certification test????  Hmmm, maybe I should just be an inspector.  I can apply after only a few years of work experience and a couple thousand bucks in fees.  I love to look at others' welds.  And that will boost my median wages up to $14.72 an hour, which if I get paid 40 hr weeks 50 weeks a year, is almost as much as that median college grad made his first year.\r\n\r\nNow I'm not arguing that there aren't fantastic welders (the guy who did my welding last year was worth his weight in gold) but they don't represent the average.  On a side note, he makes twice as much selling artwork (no certification required) as he does working for my lab.","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165606871,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16802-d19bb1a8-01bb-4896-bb9d-4676a8579ed4-1566236763"}

There are many religious people around the world who draw their morals and values from their faith. All these people aren't generally immoral or 'bad' are they? Then, if it isn't religion making a person bad on its own, what is?\r\n\r\nThese laws do not exist in Muslim countries like Turkey and Malaysia. Why?, because their society has evolved beyond them. Similarly, even more oppressive laws exist in many middle eastern countries. Yet these countries are all pre-dominantly Muslim. Hence, religion and traditions are independent. The interpretation of religion is based on existing traditions of the area and this is what leads to \"immoral\" or \"bad\" values.\r\n\r\nPakistan's effort at changing these laws is hence, evolution. And every change meets opposition.\r\n\r\nAlso, I agree that while religion (and tribal traditions) allow 'stupid' things to happen sometimes, no real religion encourages 'immoral' things per se. Its our interpretations that vary.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165332722,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_ctp43","edited":false,"id":"ctpbm","author":"alizaki","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807805,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9045-71479ba8-1fbe-4da7-8e59-7c1591adeeaf-1566236760"}

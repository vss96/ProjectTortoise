{"controversiality":0,"body":"I find this complicit response comes from a few things (please note I do not personally believe the government had a role in 9/11):\r\n\r\n1. Time. Middle class families that need both parents working long hours and finding time to take care of their kids don't have the time to spend on an uprising. \r\n\r\n2. Ignorance. Most people who believe the government had a role in 9/11 don't know what to do about it.\r\n\r\n3. Impossibility. Revolution in America is no longer possible; technology has seen to that, like that of http://www.metalstorm.com or of that new crowd control device. A firefight is one thing; a firefight where one can make the other feel like he's on fire while pumping hundreds of thousands of bullets at him per second is another. Now that we've lost the right of habeus corpus... well, american revolution is a thing of the past.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uhc0","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":15,"ups":15,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165903532,"author":"TheNoxx","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_uhc0","edited":false,"id":"cuj8l","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808366,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24204-6d4f5f4b-bcf6-4fc3-a3c5-7471f756afed-1566236767"}

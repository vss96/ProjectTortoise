I've experienced that people who don't try to 'really grasp it' are less good in mathematics than people who simply 'follow the rules' and apply the definitions, theorems etc instead of thinking about them.\r\n\r\nIn physics, the use of mathematics is a tool, not a means to understand the reality. Mathematics gives lots of possible realities but we are living in only one. So mathematics are only useful if you always ask yourself how something relates to reality. But this a totally opposite to the mathematical successful way of thinking. In QM both worlds seem to collide a bit and this had lead to some 'strange'\r\npublications from otherwise sensible people.\r\n","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166801164,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45449-fe07c548-feab-4732-b09a-33d46965d11a-1566236775"}

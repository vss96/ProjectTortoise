And I don't think any American could honestly say that the thought of terrorism wouldn't cross their mind when seeing Muslims on their flight.  You are being quite pragmatic about the situation.\r\n\r\nEven so...it is indeed very easy to criticize Gingrich because NO DAMMIT, you right wingers, we don't have to give up civil liberties to \"fight terrorism\", and NO DAMMIT, BAD NEWT, people shouldn't be arrested for practicing their religion.  People should be arrested for breaking the law.  See how that works out quite nicely?  \r\n\r\nDon't break the law = don't get arrested.  \r\nDo break the law = do get arrested. \r\n\r\nIt's interesting that openly displaying and preaching your Christian beliefs in government schools is fine and commendable, but openly practicing your Islamic beliefs in public means you should get arrested.  As a Christian, I find that reprehensible.  One more time, remind me why the pilgrims fled to this country...?","created_utc":1166483390,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cv8n5","edited":false,"id":"cva6y","author_flair_text":null,"author":"neuquino","retrieved_on":1473808873,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37045-e0f23b6d-4fd4-4e33-900d-a1e304b8d00b-1566236772"}

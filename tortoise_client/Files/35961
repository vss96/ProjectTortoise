(That SHOULD be everyone...)\r\n\r\nThe \"Megaprojects\" list is one of the most comprehensive project-by-project analysis of oil fields that is publicly available. It only uses real oil fields currently producing and real upcoming oil projects. He predicts a peak date of 2012.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this analysis an oil investor has taken that \"Megaprojects\" analysis and used different decline rates than the original conservative estimates that Chris Skrebowski used. The new analysis includes reports and news articles on projects that are not faring as well as they were when the \"Megaprojects\" analysis came out.\r\n\r\nIt paints a far bleaker picture of oil supplies out to 2010 than the previous analysis. In the best case, we can remain flat for a few years. In the worst case, we have hit the peak and we will start seeing declines within the next few years. Either analysis provides little time to start to retool our society to become less dependent on oil.","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167330763,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55272-14a87e27-d45e-4c08-80da-d4aa77ab15c6-1566236779"}

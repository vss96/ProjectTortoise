{"body":"He specifically mentions clients that support encryption, all of which play nice. When things are open source, you can make sure different implementations work together.\r\nOn a side note, in addition to encryption I like to proxy tracker communication through tor. There's no slowdown to file transfers (since p2p traffic is not proxied), and it makes it impossible for a 3rd party to see what you're downloading without joining the swarm. Unfortunately though, it can get you banned from private trackers (it would be nice if Az could exempt certain trackers from proxying)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w04a","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1167100948,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"gxti","parent_id":"t1_cw0nq","edited":false,"id":"cw0u6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809382,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50479-5fdaf4b0-ae17-446a-976b-b2ab7d70e82b-1566236778"}

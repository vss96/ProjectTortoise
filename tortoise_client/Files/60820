You have to get things past your competitors, as peer review means that your competitors judge your work.  This means that even papers that fundamentally agree with the mainstream are subject to rigorous checks.  This does mean that non-mainstream ideas can take more effort to publish, but that is how things should be.  However, non-mainstream ideas which are backed by good ideas and reproducible evidence do get through.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to show that you are wrong - there has been major and open debate between scientists about many aspects of global warming - especially the so-called 'hockey stick' graph.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the current vast majority view in science that man-made global warming is real, and a problem is not dogma - it is an idea that has taken a long time to get majority support, and has won through on the basis of substantial evidence.","created_utc":1166789934,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45210-8485a281-ae0e-4838-b908-2fc9f0df76f0-1566236774"}

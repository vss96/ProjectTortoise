Outside of that, you're starting to get into arguing territory.  However we could easily take a statistical distribution approach, that is, everything will be believed by someone but only a few things will be believed by everyone.  Moreover, this bell-curve of belief is not static.  It evolves and changes.  This is what I meant by \"lack of an official theology.\"  But you're right, I was not clear in my explanation.\r\n\r\nIn any case, my earlier \"inaccuracies\" comment in another thread lists items that are either outright inaccurate (i.e.- no one believes and/or contradicts LDS scriptures) or so few believe it today that classifying it as a \"Mormon\" belief is misleading at best.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808272,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cue61","edited":false,"id":"cuea9","author_flair_text":null,"author":"farra","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21597-54b97101-bda8-4469-b924-b43fec60a9f8-1566236765"}

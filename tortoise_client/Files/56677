And read as much as you can, there are a lot of blogs with good information on web design ([A List Apart](http://alistapart.com) might be a good place to start).\r\n\r\nOh, and I think it's usually better to have something look plain than look ugly.","link_id":"t3_u164","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15023-1e9c4dee-d2dc-4b35-ac0d-d4a836d82c05-1566236762"}

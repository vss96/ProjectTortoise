I think HTML preceded DocBook, but not by much; _perhaps about a year?_ \r\n\r\nAnyway, both HTML and DocBook started off as direct children of SGML-- _which is where &lt;para&gt; originated, IIRC, HTML shortened it to &lt;p&gt;, perhaps to speed doc xfer, but the first NCSA browser still accepted &lt;para&gt;_. \r\n\r\nEach language strives to solve very different baseline requirements. HTML is a presentation language and DocBook is semantic markup for book style documents, specifically the Linux HOW-TOs, IIRC.\r\n\r\nIronically, HTML has had DocBook envy for alot of years now. It's all the rage in web-design circles to talk about \"semantic markup\", and yet they never really escape the HTML orbit to do something that looks and smells like SGML.\r\n\r\nProbably that's a good thing because the tag-soup that SGML languages have imposed on us is truly horrible. If LaTeX has anything going for it, it's the lack of angle brackets. At least with the current HTML orbit, we write alot of our semantics in Java or Ruby, where it's alot easier to see what's really going on.\r\n\r\nThe next generation of markup languages need to be both semantic and easy to type and read _as markup_, before they're translated into something else. Designing a language under the assumption that people will write a WYSIWYM emacs mode instead of using Notepad or /bin/vi was a bad, bad mistake and the Web still hasn't recovered.","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1165418227,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctrba","id":"ctuax","author_flair_text":null,"author":"kanagawa","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807898,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11534-bb1bdf0a-41c0-4181-8065-ff18304b2cbf-1566236761"}

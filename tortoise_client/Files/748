{"body":"Sblinn, you might want to consider [Russian's land war with Afghanistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan) before making that bold statement.  Russia lost nearly half a million troops, mostly to sickness. \r\n\r\nRegarding WW2:  I was always under the understanding that it was not so much the Russian army but Hitler's decision to attack Russia with troops ill-prepared for the russian winter that led to Germany's massive casualties on the eastern front.\r\n\r\nSo maybe a better lesson is, **never stage wars in foreign lands that you don't understand**.  Perhaps Bush can tell us whether it still applies today?","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u5eq","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165619193,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"odioworks_com","id":"cu6gj","parent_id":"t1_cu6df","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808126,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17260-9a7bdb49-781e-4606-890f-e41c0511a3bf-1566236763"}

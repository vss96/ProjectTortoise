It's like trying to put a river into labelled boxes.\r\n\r\nTake the highschool definition of 'seperate species can't breed together' for example, it only works on the organisms that reproduce sexually, and it doesn't even work for all of those. Eg there are organisms spread over multiple overlapping geographies, where A can breed with B, B can breed with C, but C can't breed with A - is A a seperate species from C? The ability to breed is also not binary on/off deal, the success rate merely declines as the individuals become more diverse from each other. \r\n\r\nThe whole macro/micro-evolution red-herring will never get taken seriously until somebody can put their hand up and say what they mean by \"a different species\".","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21540-2810608a-da9b-4d00-be65-ea2dc34f8ae7-1566236765"}

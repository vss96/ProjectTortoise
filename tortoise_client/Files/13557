Okay, so why the difference between 1st degree, 2nd degree murder, manslaughter, culpable homicide, etc. [Disclaimer: I am neither American nor a lawyer, but I do watch Law &amp; Order. ;-) I am open to having my misconceptions reconceptified.]\r\n\r\n2) I absolutely believe that everyone including (especially!) children should have certain inaliable rights. I also believe that certain rights should be counter-balanced by responsibility. Example: Please buy a gun; it's your right. However, if you act irresponsibly w.r.t. to that gun, then you'll have to give it back. \r\n\r\n&gt; As for his other crimes, well, that's why we have a \r\n&gt; legal system.\r\n\r\nI fail to understand why you think it would have been better for his mother to do nothing and wait for him to commit a really serious crime (he was heading in that general direction) and have the legal system deal with him. His rights would have been just as violated, if not more so. I am quite sure two years in Cambodia did more for his personal development than two years in a juvenile detention centre where he, by definition, would have mostly had fellow delinquents as role models. \r\n\r\nI share your concern over the various disparities w.r.t. the age at which certain rights are granted. I don't know if in the U.S. there is any requirement for laws to be fair.\r\n\r\nI also share your concern over the rights of children and have some first-hand experience with that. When I was at school (in the 80's) it was acceptable, in South Africa, for teachers to \"cane\" students -- hit them on the backside with a stick. I look back to those occasions when I was caned and the one that sticks in my mind the most was when I wasn't caned at all but threatened with a caning. You see, with the canings I had done something wrong, got caught, faced the consequences, and got to show off the welts to my friends. (Don't try picture that.) The threat of caning was something else because it was a blatant power-play by the teacher to enforce some petty decision he'd made which I thought was completely wrong. I feel shame and anger at not standing up to him for fear of a caning. 17 years later I'd still like to punch that cunt in his face.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_twhc","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165498696,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13674-2b2944ef-22d8-4043-a8f0-d8aea54cab91-1566236762"}

If you use their shit, you gotta do it their way.\r\n\r\nThe music industry has been crashing for years now.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe porn industry -- as evidenced by this policy from one of the top porn sites on the web -- is offering unlimited content downloads with a membership. There is no DRM. It clearly states you can save all the movies on your HD and never lose them. Their pictures are ultra-high resolution. They even have sets zipped up so you can pop em all on your HD real quick before your subscription runs out.\r\n\r\nThe porn industry is booming, and is one of the most succesful industries of the dotcom era.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople want porn, and people want music. Is it coincidence, then, the discrepancy in success in leiu of the internet? I think not.","created_utc":1166289320,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32521-9c4eb22d-b491-40b1-9522-00b3f970dd8b-1566236770"}

He draws convincing comparisons to the romanticizing of consumption, which we now call tuberculosis and can treat effectively.\r\n\r\nIn years past, consumption was considered a natural consequence of a sensitive, aesthetic, creative nature; coughing up blood was something one could naturally expect from a true artist.\r\n\r\nHe thinks that the romanticization of depression is equally nonsensical.\r\n\r\nHe lines up the research that has been done on depression in the last decade or three, most of which hasn't made its way into the popular culture.  What one hears about \"Depression is a simple chemical imbalance\" is the tiniest, most peripheral part of the very small part of the story we know.\r\n\r\nOne thing that has become clearer and clearer with more recent research is that depression meets any reasonable definition of \"physical disease,\" easily.  As easily as tuberculosis does.\r\n\r\nAll this is laid out in considerable detail in Kramer's fascinating book, _Against Depression_.\r\n\r\nBack to the article -- this fellow Dworkin seems to embody the ideas Kramer criticizes.  I think reading _Against Depression_ would be a *very* good idea for anyone who finds Dworkin convincing.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tbpg","subreddit":"science","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165122595,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4500-47e6694a-ab10-4b93-970d-14754924fd5c-1566236759"}

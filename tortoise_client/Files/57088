I have to say that the article at the Chinese site is a lot more neutral. First of all, they have pictures to show that those people were wearing surgical masks, and it is only briefly mentioned in the WP site. Also, although WP says that there are people who praise these kinds of action, they have to add a title of \"Communist Party secretary\" to that person, while the Chinese site says \"locals\" are supporting this because it already reduced the prostitution rate in the area.\r\n\r\nI am not taking a side for the issue, just want to say that a lot of western newspapers seem to always bash China. But now I am just making a generalized statement on a generalization that I suspected is made by the western media.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165769162,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":8,"ups":8,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuc3c","parent_id":"t3_ubdm","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"beginner","retrieved_on":1473808231,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20292-52c21aa9-fd57-4b7d-98d8-733995aa377c-1566236765"}

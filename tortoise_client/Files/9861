The US has gone beyond these crude methods and perfected a means of torture whereby the living souls have been sapped away from the prisoners.  The whole story about it being ironic is that a Christian State that believes in the eternal state of the Soul has found a way (and systematically uses it) to destroy the souls of individuals.

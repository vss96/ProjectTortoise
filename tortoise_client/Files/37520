I warned him \"trust me, you don't wanna challenge me online\" but he persisted. I had two windows open - one online chess between him and me and then a decent chess game/software on my local machine between me and the computer at advanced level. Whatever he did on the online chess, I made the same move with the computer locally. Whatever the computer did, I made that move with him online.\r\n\r\nAfter losing 9 out of 9 games, he finally gave up saying something along the lines of me being the best player he'd ever played against. I don't remember his exact words because I was too busy reading Fark while all of this was going on.","link_id":"t3_v3ma","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808778,"distinguished":null,"author":"chime","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cv580","parent_id":"t3_v3ma","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34515-a337c523-76c6-452e-a218-103b7e131de9-1566236771"}

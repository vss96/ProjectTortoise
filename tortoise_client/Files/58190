Something someone wrote?\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople can write and propagate all the lies they wan't it doesn't make them any less of a lie.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, who translated the text that is now the Book of Mormon. And Gordon B. Hinkley(The current president of teh Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) IS a living prophet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author has nothing but contempt for this man (Romney) for the  single reason that he is a Latter Day Saint.

I'm not so impressed by appeals to \"protected circumstances\".\r\n\r\nIn some countries, becoming an \"economic wreck\" is easier and in some countries it's harder. Having an education makes it a lot easier almost everywhere. A combination of dependents, few options and a low-paying job makes it so  hard that it's difficult to comprehend. You will do things for your children that you'd never do otherwise. The lack of hope and options will make escapist behaviour such as alcohol or drug misuse very much more likely.\r\n\r\nThis is nothing new.","retrieved_on":1473809290,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvvwl","parent_id":"t1_cvvgt","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mikaelhg","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"47986-26719851-dc65-4403-8816-700c6fbec14a-1566236777"}

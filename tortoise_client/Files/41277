The really expensive stuff (think Rational) tends to have very few users. And with a small user base, there is less resources and motivation for the developers to actually so a good job (again, think Rational).\r\n\r\nThe expensive stuff also usually is backed by enough money to have a company with their own (separate) support issue handling department, which also usually happens to be largely incompetent.\r\n\r\nAs the software matures it becomes more tailored to \"focus groups\" than real customer issues as the line of communication between customers and developers is translated through a bunch of incompetent, low-wage helpdesk monkeys. Having been an incompetent low-wage helpdesk monkey myself I can't understand why companies trust some of their most valuable feedback to people like me.","link_id":"t3_ujgi","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808401,"distinguished":null,"author":"senzei","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cul3j","id":"cul4y","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25055-e13f9f30-47ef-43aa-b662-f58d15eca952-1566236767"}

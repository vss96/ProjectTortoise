{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ujny","subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"99% of my purchases have come from the iTunes music store since it opened. When I had a CD changer in the car, I burned playlists to CDs; no problem. Those CDs can be used just like any CD bought at a CD store. I've kept copies in the car. I've used tracks from them for small home videos. If I wanted to, I could transfer tracks from these CDs to any music player I know of. Creating CDs this way is allowed by Apple's DRM. \r\n\r\nI like the option to buy individual tracks. Providing music by the track is not practicle with physical CDs, but distributing music in downloadable files is easily subject to sharing/abuse. So, for the forseable future DRM will be a part of any service that provides individual tracks.\r\n\r\nApple's DRM is one of the least onerous DRMs. Doing away with DRM would be better but Apple's DRM is not as bad as many make it out to be. No DRM would mean no legal downloads  for the vast majority of popular music. I'm willing to live with iTunes' DRM.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165943718,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":10,"ups":10,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"culat","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuk6b","author_flair_text":null,"author":"rkm000","retrieved_on":1473808405,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25132-d7a27e48-c691-45a5-95d9-df856c6c9216-1566236767"}

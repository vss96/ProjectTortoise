I'm not sure what point you intended to explain.\r\n\r\nYou defined capitalism using money. *(\"any economy in which money exists and is used to make measuring the flow of resources easier\")*\r\n\r\n However, there exist non-capitalist systems which use money too. I believe Krugman offered an example of a babysitter's club which used money, to supposedly demonstrate recessions. Another example is a system where the means of production have no owners (or is owned by everyone, so to speak), which can certainly use money.\r\n\r\nMoney is a helpful innovation which saves people from barter's inefficiency. This innovation may apply to different economic types.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Intellectual property is a legal fiction designed to enforce monopoly business practices. It is in no way a necessary logical extension of proprietary rights.\r\n\r\nWell, property itself is a \"legal fiction\" too. But we're in agreement that intellectual property's not part of actual capitalism.\r\n\r\nIt's understandable why it exists though. Market economies have a hard time with infinitely copyable goods, due to the \"free rider problem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Capitalism doesn't technically require a state, in theory. In practice, however, I have a pretty difficult time imagining capitalism as a sustainable system without a minimal state\r\n\r\nYes, in practice, capitalist states are expected to not only enforce property rights, but also protect people from the worst consequences of capitalism. (For example, we have 40 hour workweeks, though of course in reality people work longer.)\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; -- or any system being sustainable under such conditions, for that matter, including mere social chaos. A constitutional association is necessary to counteract the potential for a nonconstitutional association growing powerful enough to completely screw the pooch.\r\n\r\nI expect you can find a good deal of anarchist literature on post-state systems, or ones where the role of the state is fundamentally transformed. Like corporations, nation-states are artificial entities, and cause serious problems.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808376,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuiyr","id":"cujq8","author":"tayssir","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24431-7de43cbf-f3c7-4c32-8556-da38e9012c58-1566236767"}

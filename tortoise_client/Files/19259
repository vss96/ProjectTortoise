No soldiers said such a thing, two French journalists promoting their documentary claim anonymous voices assert this in their work.  Use reason for a few seconds.  Before a special forces task force had been deployed the rules of engagement would be clear.  French snipers wouldn't be sighting Osama while U.S. authorities decide what to do.  Bin Laden is walking around the mountains and special forces are within a mile of him but don't do anything and lose track of him because the Americans did not actually want him taken out.  And the French guys are so concerned with American bureaucrats thousands of miles away and the American snipers won't kill Osama because they're that afraid of a voice on a phone.  Anyone who shot bin Laden would be a famed warrior. \r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43623-0acdac69-37ed-4b09-bd40-a7a0dd29c085-1566236774"}

But to me it just sounds like it is something to tell themselves and others similarily aggrieved by the series' cancellation to justify it to themselves.  Don't get me wrong, I liked Firefly as much as the next science-fiction fan, but it was a niche show.  There has never been a Firefly episode I have seen, where I look back at the order I saw them (and that Fox aired them in), and say OMG if only I could have seen that in the correct order I can see how the show would have been less niche.","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165588045,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu422","id":"cu454","author_flair_text":null,"author":"rmtew","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808080,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15970-79b25f0b-068f-4d2b-9a24-1cf074600822-1566236763"}

{"body":"Funnily enough, most people blame the blink tag on Microsoft, but from what I understand, it was Netscape 4 that invented it.  My memory might be a little hazy, but I believe Firefox supports it still as well, along with the CSS equivalent (as you pointed out).  Just checked the page in IE 6 and Opera 9, neither one supports it.  I don't believe either one will do the blink tag, either.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_umdf","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"created_utc":1165983689,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"jimbobhickville","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cun27","edited":false,"id":"cunvc","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808453,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26369-de5ce9bd-ac6d-46e7-a75e-c3ec174202dc-1566236767"}

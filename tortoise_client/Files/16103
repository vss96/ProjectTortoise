It did nothing to 'prove' anything, other than the author liked the sound of his own voice.\r\n\r\nWhile art may not be totally subjective, in large part it is - particular in relation to those that like to call themselves 'art critics'. Time and again these types have been shown up by painting made by monkeys or eight year olds - claiming they are 'good' art. So little real 'taste' in those with so much 'experience' points out forcefully that there is something rotten in the state of denmark.\r\n\r\nIn reality art has lost touch with any objective measure of quality. It's adrift in a sea of fads and fashionable statements. All style, no substance. No wonder that most people have realised it's all subjective and that the emperor has no clothes. The very idea that 'shock'='art' shows how far from its basics art theory has got.\r\n\r\nArt is good, is indeed art, if YOU think it is. It's the personal search for beauty - it's subjective.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ufsk","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808343,"author":"dude78","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cui15","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ufsk","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23563-215604ee-4045-4517-9b54-0453362380c0-1566236766"}

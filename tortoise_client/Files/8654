Women are steered more towards social and interpersonal/interdependent situations and english/history/etc while men are steered more towards acting independently, away from analyzing / taking into account feelings and emotions, given more support in science, math.  I'm not even taking into account obvious gender stereotyping and discrimination here, just the way our culture works at its base level.  It's not just biological differences that can be taken for granted.","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166124070,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","id":"custw","parent_id":"t1_cus8b","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"wuzzle","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808544,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28584-bdd45cc2-6254-423c-b96b-ab02fe8304dc-1566236768"}

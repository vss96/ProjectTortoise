No true scientist would bet his life that there isn't a God, just on the off chance there is.\r\n\r\nI don't accept that definition of \"agnostic\".\r\n\r\nI consider myself an atheist, even though I know very well that I can't be absolutely certain there is no God -- in fact, it is logically impossible to prove or disprove the existence of God.\r\n\r\nIf this seems contradictory to you, just understand that there is a difference between having an *opinion* about something (even a very strong opinion) and being able to *prove* it. An agnostic, IMO, is someone who simply has no opinion on the matter. An atheist is someone who believes that there is no God -- even if he (as he should) accepts *some* possibility that he might be wrong.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6949-a8439021-9ba0-4823-9021-56140b4b8d37-1566236760"}

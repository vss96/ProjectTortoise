A real Christian would have no need at all to even make mention of the fact.\r\n\r\n*\"I'm a Christian, but never say so in public.\"*  Hahaha!  And Craigslist isn't public?\r\n\r\nThere is a certain amount of self-righteousness too in the written words I read.  *\"Living like animals\"* is one.\r\n\r\n*\"I wish the symbols of my faith and country represented what I believe.\"*  This is actually against biblical principle.  \r\n\r\n\"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

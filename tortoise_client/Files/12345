Fine.  \r\n\r\n***There are no absolutes***\r\n\r\nIf I had said that \"all war is caused by religion\" I would have gotten responses starting with \"What about...?\"\r\n\r\nTo make my statement more clear:\r\nAlmost every war has partial cause grounded in religion, whether obvious or hidden in motivation.  There are exceptions.  Japan in WWII had no religious motivation.  \r\n\r\nHitler wanted Jews dead.  Hitler invaded Poland to 'cleanse' it.  Therefore Hitler started WWII for religious reasons.  It's not the only reason he invaded.  He wanted power, money and land.  He was also a fucking insane nationalist zealot.\r\n\r\nAfghanistan was just a proxy war for the cold war, much like Korea and Vietnam.  America was protecting herself and the world from the GODLESS communists.  The Soviet regime was atheist.\r\n\r\nAmerica was largely founded by religious outcasts from Catholicism and the Church of England.  The Revolutionary War was about a lot more than religion, but it certainly played a part.  Freedom of religion was a big part of the push for independence, as was taxation and sovereignty.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166649523,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cviq1","edited":false,"id":"cvjmo","author_flair_text":null,"author":"pascha","retrieved_on":1473809055,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41798-43b8bf3f-471d-4522-a79f-ccaea54a8f73-1566236774"}

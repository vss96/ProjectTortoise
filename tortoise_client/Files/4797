Google would win out even in a perfect world where nobody has heard of search engines.\r\n\r\nSomething with a million features on the screen sounds great on paper, but probably 90% of the people who use it aren't going to use 90% of the features. One person might use one small subset of features, another might use another subset, etc, but for each of those users there will be a large majority of features that are unused and are just wasting space. \r\n\r\nThat's why google wins out. It's just a search box, because 90% of users just want to search, and those 10% that are power users are also the types to take the time to learn how to access google's extra features.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the power of simplicity and elegance: it minimizes extraneous features for the maximum number of people.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808623,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cuwzx","parent_id":"t1_cuv7x","author_flair_text":null,"author":"MattL920","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30568-819078f8-deb4-42ec-bfd8-e4f1ae78e80b-1566236769"}

I have such sensitive touch sensation that touching grass barefoot is *unbearable* to me, and orgasms are literally out of this world.\r\n\r\nI find that virtually all of my problems with relationships are due to evolutionary pressures, as *only* other supersensitives really get along w/ me in an intimate setting; yet I've never met another supersensitive guy (but about 5 women), which is also what you would expect for a rising mutation.\r\n\r\nThe quesiton is:  If I see more, hear more, sense more, and taste more than you, and since our senses are our only connections with the outside world, doesn't that mean I can and do have a better *chance* of having a better grasp on how things really are than you?  If not, do you really believe you can sniff better than a blood hound?

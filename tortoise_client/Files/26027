{"controversiality":0,"body":"I would personally bet $50 that he wasn't a student.\r\nHow often do you suppose students put on suits, put up placards, and yell at their classmates about damnation during passing periods?\r\n\r\nStudents do evangelize, but it is rarely done so impersonally simply because ministering to students is most effectively done when you are obviously a student. If you are a student and you want to spread the word, you join social groups, you invite friends, you maybe set up a table. It would be a waste of your time to put on a suit and argue with strangers. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are thousands of people who make a lifestyle out of traveling to college campuses and attacking those citadels of (imagined) godlessness. Organized churches  (CRU, etc) are all pretty well established already, so the generally unaffiliated find themselves in the public squares, yelling at those who will listen (setting up a booth or handing out flyers just gets you ignored.) Your target audience is mainly a small subset of those who are already religiously affiliated but not fulfilled, and one good way to win them over is by confidently standing up to the godlessness around them that makes them uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nWhoa. Tangent, sorry. Anyway, yes it is possible that the preacher is a student, but very unlikely.","link_id":"t3_u6la","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165630655,"score":17,"ups":17,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"doubtingthomas","parent_id":"t1_cu6zy","id":"cu72m","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808137,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17666-9e50be2b-c76b-4bdf-b120-061fc370728b-1566236763"}

When he ships something that is used by people on a regular basis call me. This guy's musings are way over-exposed on reddit, and frankly it lessons the community's reputation that he gets so much attention. \r\n\r\nThe reality is he has a niche product. Good for him. If he had a really good product in all the time he's been doing it we'd be using it instead about hearing about how he makes it.\r\n\r\nFinally any software business that relies heavily on recent college grads for success is wasting time. There are many many very good under paid veteran programmers that would be more than willing to take his niche market and make it a mainstream market. That he instead relies on fresh crops of college students every year means he is unwilling to pay enough money to get the job done. You either pay your employees what they are worth or end up with a mediocre business. It's the story of American business writ large.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uv0q","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808606,"author":"smacfarl","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuw4v","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uv0q","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30226-5326413f-d535-403e-aa2f-25d81216d968-1566236769"}

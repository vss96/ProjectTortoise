According to Statistics Canada there is more suicides than traffic fatalities each year.\r\nhttp://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/health30a.htm?sdi=motor%20vehicle%20accidents\r\nhttp://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/hlth66a.htm\r\n\r\n Compare how many times you hear in the media about a traffic fatality (couple of times a week) incident versus a suicide (couple of times a year and only if it was some kind of celebrity or related to a bigger story) and tell me that suicides are reported in the media. When there is one in the metro they simply announce a technical difficulty.\r\n\r\nStill I admit that the story sounds fishy. Its either made up, either the guy embellished the scenario. \r\n\r\nIt sounded so fake that I was expecting an ending where the guy in the suit then recognizes his son under the train or something like that.","controversiality":0,"score":34,"ups":34,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164995048,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ct94q","parent_id":"t1_ct8y8","author":"ArcticCelt","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807500,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1615-7bb541ba-4869-428d-a108-006235cc6f74-1566236758"}

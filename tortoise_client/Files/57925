Allowing users to choose their floor after entering a paticular elevator would remove all the efficiencies this new system. The reason the buttons are on the outside (and must remain *only* on the oustide) is because an algorithm groups riders by assigning them to specific elevators that will assure the most efficient ride for the average user (namely, the shortest wait time &amp; ride time.)\r\n\r\nIn fact, ideally your floor selection (reservation) should be made as early as possible (at the entrance of the building,) and your elevator assignment made at the last possible moment (via monitors over the elevators.) \r\n\r\nHowever, as evidenced by the majority of comments on this page, most people are loathe to give up the privilege of making these last minute decisions.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807766,"gilded":0,"id":"ctn8x","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctma8","author_flair_text":null,"author":"froese","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8177-2eab63f2-85f9-4b0f-979d-139b4bc404e8-1566236760"}

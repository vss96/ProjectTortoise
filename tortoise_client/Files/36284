First of all, you attribute FSM to Dawkins. ideaJack is okay with you I guess. Dawkins doesn't take credit for FSM at all, he very carefully explains his sources in 'the God Delusion.' Unfortunately, he is also sometimes downright spiteful in the book.\r\n\r\nFSM isn't any more peurile than what it was meant to attack: that teaching creationism isn't the same as teaching science. Perhaps society has taken it far beyond the original point, but if it wasn't for creationist mangling of the separation of church and State FSMism wouldn't have happened in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe fact that people are willing to die rather than renounce something is not a case for religion, it is a case against. Jim Jones, Waco, etc. etc. etc. Christianity is a cult that is too pervasive to call a cult, at least in america. But your implication that the only real things are those people willing to die for is not peurile, it is sophomoric.\r\n\r\nAnd on that 2006 A.D. thing. The fact that a cult is powerful and manages to leave cultural baggage around it isn't an indication that it is somehow right. Witness Mao, the Nazis, Stalin, and so on, all of whom impressed their immoral ideology on the local environment and left lots of (local) baggage similar to the zero point in some time system or other. \r\n\r\nAnd I didn't downvote you. And it isn't up to you to decide who thinks. Unless you think that you have some kind of supernatural superiority about who is thinking and who is not. \r\n\r\nI don't deny you are thinking. I just don't agree with you. (and unlike the cults, I don't believe that those not part of my cult will be tortured for an eternity by their 'benevolant' god).","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"525-72fa9440-01a9-4cd8-ac39-45dff97d6191-1566236758"}

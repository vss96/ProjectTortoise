It's called ignoring the problem. Would it not be better to come up with a system that is self sustaining and doesn't make people work into their 70s? Would it not make more sense to start doing that now instead of waiting until the liabilities are even greater?\r\n\r\nA solution would be a gradual transition to private accounts. Maybe we (the smart ones not counting on the feds to care of them) will naturally transition (through IRAs) to this anyway, as the retirement age keeps getting pushed up until everyone is dead before they can collect SS. At least us who saved and invested privately can retire.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that touching SS is political death so no one wants to actually do anything about it.\r\n\r\n&gt; so GWB and his cronies can drain it off in the meantime\r\n\r\nWhat does that even mean? How do they profit off of the current SS situation at all? So if SS is privatized, then GWBs Wall Street cronies profit, but if it stays the same GWBs cronies still profit?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vc4j","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-3,"ups":-3,"created_utc":1166567097,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39521-bdf2f8b0-ded0-481e-ade6-5b056afe74b5-1566236773"}

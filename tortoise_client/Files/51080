I was under pressure to fix something, and this was a last minute refactoring before submission.  I thought I typed a command that tested this code path, but I was wrong -- it didn't hit it.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Blatant typo renders system unusable.  *F*CK*.  Most other languages would have caught this at compile time -- wrong number of parameters.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; I still like Python for what it can do -- it fills an incredible niche.  However, for things that thousands of people rely on, and multiple programmers have their hands in, I just had a little rude awakening...\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, someone under pressure to make a last-minute change hits a bug, and this is Python's fault?  Which could have been avoided with pychecker or pylint.\r\n\r\nYou get huge productivity gains from using it, so you can't turn around and slag it for no type-checking, when if you USED a strict typing language you wouldn't even be halfway done with the project yet.\r\n\r\nIf you're using ginsu knives you might cut yourself.  Use butter knives for safety and it'll take forever to cut up your ingredients and prepare the dish.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46097-5764b407-80e2-41af-b24f-f833bda78c4e-1566236775"}

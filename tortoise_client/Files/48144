Say that the *n*th term is the first term to contain the digit *4* (or greater).  Then the *(n-1)*th term must have had at least *4* of some digit in a row.  That is, it contained the substring **\"dddd\"** for some *d*.  This means one of two things:\r\n\r\n* A part of the *(n-2)*th term of the sequence was read **\"d d's, d d's\"**.  This, of course, does not work, since such a piece would instead be read as **\"2d d's\"**.\r\n\r\n* For some *s*,*t* (*t!=d*, otherwise see Case 1), a part of the *(n-2)*th term of the sequence was read **\"s d's, d d's, d t's\"**.  This also cannot happen, since that piece would be read **\"s+d d's, d t's\"**.\r\n\r\nThe only time that this argument fails is if *n&lt;3* (in a *1*-based index), so there is no *(n-2)*th term.  So we have one of the following:\r\n\r\n* *n=1*.  In other words, the seed number contains the offending digit, as covered by **pwill**'s post.\r\n\r\n* *n=2*.  Since the *n*th term is the first to contain the offending digit, the seed number must contain a run of more than *3* of the same digit, also as covered by **pwill**'s post.\r\n\r\nSo as long as the seed number does not contain a digit greater than *3* and does not contain a run of more than *3* of the same digit, no term of the look-and-say sequence will contain a digit greater than *3*.\r\n\r\n**Q.E.D.**\r\n\r\nedit: corrected typo and fixed markdown","link_id":"t3_taga","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3523-ec0fe232-0bf1-45e6-ad2d-2b1178f68b49-1566236759"}

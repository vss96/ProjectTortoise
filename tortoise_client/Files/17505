A pair of pants that were donated by someone in America costs $7 to someone in Africa, a price likely calculated to be the most they can charge and still undercut all the local industry. So 10% (or whatever percentage is it is) of the costs Africans bore to clothe themselves goes back into their local economies, but the other 90% (or maybe 80% of that) is getting sucked out of the local economy, making them net poorer.\r\n\r\nHowever, if an organization made it their business to take donated clothing and deliver it for free to Africa, the net effect might be positive. While the cost to the local economy of eliminating the local clothing industry might be high, it might be more than offset by having 100% of the costs Africans bore to clothe themselves free to be invested on other things. It would also make the charities' current practices unprofitable for them.","created_utc":1166746087,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvp5l","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvoym","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","retrieved_on":1473809162,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44592-2af21cf5-9107-48b4-a636-56a3309d6b6e-1566236774"}

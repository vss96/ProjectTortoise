{"controversiality":0,"body":"Found myself brainstorming with a friend during a long road trip this past week and we came up with some great ideas for online services, and one really stuck.  I've always wanted to start a website up on my own and perhaps make an occupation out of it, and since I'm worthless and workless right now, I figure I'd give it a shot.  Where is a good source for finding freelance web programmers and designers to create an online service from the ground up, for those of us on a budget (~$10,000)?  Anyone think it's a bad idea to dive into the online playing field, or do you encourage it? I need advice!","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ub64","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165739818,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"artia","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cub65","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ub64","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808214,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19875-1b924531-2405-4902-afce-78084df75df2-1566236764"}

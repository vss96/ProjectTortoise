{"body":"Wealth != income.\r\n\r\nSay I have ten million dollars in my checking account, and for my large deposit the bank has graced my account with a 0.5% interest rate.  This means that I make $50K per year in interest, and it's renewable as long as I don't spend any more.\r\n\r\nNow compare that to a new college grad working for Intel. He might make $60K per year, but has a lot of debt, and probably zero assets. His income is larger, but I'm much wealthier.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tour","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165361523,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"hamsterboy","edited":false,"id":"ctrjm","parent_id":"t1_ctpwj","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807846,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10183-cd9b9362-9a72-4b0d-b978-3d9055c3db1a-1566236761"}

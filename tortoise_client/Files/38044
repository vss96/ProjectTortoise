That extends to the idea that they can offend and say anything they want, but not under the employment of another. They can teach anything and offend anyone but they would need to create their own institution. The teachers in these schools are part of a whole, and if the leader of that whole doesn't like them saying those things there isn't much to be done.\r\n\r\nWhat really needs to be addressed is not the teachers right to offend, but the schools right to release responsibility for its teachers actions. If they could achieve that separation that protects web forums from user responsibility then a school could hire who they wanted, and the teachers could say what they felt correct. Not sure how to do that but it would be interesting.\r\n\r\nA dead simple and possible false example is a teacher saying something offending, and then a student being unable to sue the school for it, and instead have to go after the teacher. Teachers could be sued for doing several different things and schools could still keep them on. Schools wouldn't have to fire if they didn't want to anymore. Teachers would be able to offend all they wanted then and not worry so much about their job as just negative press.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809199,"gilded":0,"id":"cvr40","parent_id":"t3_vqg5","edited":false,"author":"sosuke","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45502-3d4e544e-45cd-45d9-9c69-88045f707461-1566236775"}

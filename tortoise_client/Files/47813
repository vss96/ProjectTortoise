{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v0cp","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","body":"I have an idea for a web application/startup. Not Web 2.0 at all, but I think it would be a nifty idea to implement. I have worked on it for awhile, but its sometimes hard to find the motivation when you are working by yourself. I'd like someone to throw idea off of to find out if they at good, bad, stupid, etc.\r\nHopefully, the person could be an equal programmer to with the web application. My question is how do you find these people? Who are motivated to work on sites and see where they might progress? If an opportunity to work on a site that I could relate to came up I would work on it, but I have no idea how to find them myself.\r\nI have tried asking people I know. They say its a good idea (if they are being nice?). Yet, even though they are very computer inclined, they do not want to help/work with me.\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nPS-I left my idea out because I would like to know more about the process. Sorry, got to save it for the billion dollar sale. ;)","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166260675,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cv0d9","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v0cp","author":"jtarchie","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808687,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32227-ea5b890a-c510-4546-b05c-05480c2ea6cb-1566236770"}

I had been drinking the equivalent of 4-8 espresso shots a day for a few years (yes quite a bit).  I quit basically cold turkey and the pains in the head which followed for the next month were unbelievably painful.  Excrutiating pain.  I would come home from work and just sleep sleep sleep until the next morning began in order to avoid any interactions whatsoever.  If that is what withdrawal does then only imagine what the caffeine is doing.  After about 6 weeks the pain subsided and now a year later my head is clearer than ever and I look at this as one of the greatest accomplishments of my life.  All the coffee shops you see around you are nothing more than heroin depots to my eyes now....   Indeed they estimate that 98% of the \"headaches\" experienced in America are just caffeine withdrawal symptoms....  Quit while you can.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167271939,"score":9,"ups":9,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_w5fg","id":"cw7ja","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"cyruspp","retrieved_on":1473809512,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54155-38558104-f8bc-4261-9ba2-b283139a45c6-1566236779"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Another source of power in government is a military force. But this, to be efficient, must be superior to any force that exists among the people, or which they can command; for otherwise this force would be annihilated, on the first exercise of acts of oppression. Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretence, raised in the United States.\r\n\r\n-Daniel Webster\r\n\r\nWe have a standing army that is already more powerful than any force of the people, and, depending on the outcome of this case, we might not be able to have guns. Think about it.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u9bd","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165735811,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"bosmat","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cub1v","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u9bd","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808212,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19814-49b9259d-96ba-4a95-b1c7-b9b43cad8909-1566236764"}

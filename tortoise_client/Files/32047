{"body":"There's a piece of software called BitRock Installer that creates installers for Windows, Linux and OS X. I prefer having the package manager take care of things because it can automatically update the software. That's where setup programs are shit. You'll almost always have to do a manual download unless the developer is considerate enough to include an auto-update tool. And for the record, EA Games does *not* provide an auto-update tool for *any* of its games. Downloading a 1gb patch and then realizing you need the earlier 400mb patch installed is frustrating. So is checking a website every few weeks to see if there's a patch.\r\n\r\nActually, that's what I found interesting...On Windows, I would have to check 4 or 5 websites for updates for the Gimp, Gaim, Notepad++, cygwin and NVU. But on Linux, one command takes care of that.\r\n\r\nI'd rather have perform a search in synaptic once after finding a piece of software rather than visiting tons of websites for updates. Package managers are a complete win, even for binary-only software.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wifs","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167582869,"score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"OMouse","id":"cwjul","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwjrm","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809741,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60249-8648ef97-36b3-4109-b61a-2d31ebfd8987-1566236780"}

{"body":"1. I don't think anybody who emailed you would expect to be paid. You were asking for partners after all.\r\n\r\n2. As I said elsewhere, incorporation and partners and funding are less important than simply working on the problem.\r\n\r\n3. Even if I can't answer your original question I can point out things that don't help. Can you see that not revealing the idea gets in the way of finding partners?\r\n\r\n  What's the difference between a startup idea and a side project? The degree of focus you bring to it. How much you focus on feedback from users. How much your goal is creating value of any sort (and going where there is value to be created) rather than working on a specific problem.\r\n\r\n  In fact, since the idea is less important in a startup than in a side project, side projects actually have *more* reason to keep ideas secret than do startups.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v0cp","subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166315011,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"akkartik","edited":false,"id":"cv2ev","parent_id":"t1_cv1w1","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808725,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33056-5bbb0182-e3cf-4639-a090-437a6c0de60f-1566236770"}

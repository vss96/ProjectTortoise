They are a solution worse than the disease.\r\n\r\nThe idea that private accounts are workable ignores the fact that individuals can already save for retirement, but don't, and also that those who have been paying social security taxes for the past twenty to forty years have some reasonable expectation they were to be rewarded for that in due time, not flim-flammed by private account advocates who paint rosy scenarios about investing tiny accounts in Treasury bonds, selling them each for individual annuities at retirement time, neglecting to explain how this can be done so much more efficiently than the Social Security system is already doing to make the payoff worthwhile, while providing enough profit for the commercial vendors of private accounts to engage in the business. Or explaining how changing the investment of many billions of dollars of Treasury bonds into the stock market will not result in bidding down the return on stocks, because the current holders of those stocks will be required to give them up, and buyers found for the Treasury bills.\r\n\r\nThe point of \"draining it off\" is that if the fiscal balance of the budget does not have to take into account SS obligations, because we can convince the 20-somethings they will get nothing, then we can create tax cuts for the wealthy members of GWB's \"base\" and use SS revenues to make up for it.","retrieved_on":1473808971,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvfe0","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvf59","author_flair_text":null,"author":"sickofthisshit","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39656-5f1591d8-8298-4fc8-be64-3f06e6384d77-1566236773"}

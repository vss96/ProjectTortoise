I'm not saying it's bad but you could at least give some direction on the Exercises area.  For example, I have no idea what the syntax of the show function is, though you mention it in Exercise 2.  You link to (what I presume to be) some official Haskell API which doesn't help in the least.  If the audience of the book is somebody who either knows Scheme/Lisp (which I would say I have working knowledge of the basics of) or somebody new to programming (which I'd say I am not), then I think more specific examples of syntax and functions would help immensely.\r\n\r\nI clicked to the second page and I was immediately overwhelmed by double colons and right arrows.  Honestly, I think your first page should qualify that a somewhat basic knowledge of Haskell programming is required because I can't follow it.  Finally, it might be worth it to give some example compiler errors and how they should be looked at by a user.  I got my first compile error after typing in the very first program and I had no idea why - it wasn't until I reached the information about the do block that I realized it all had to be aligned properly and the compile errors didn't help in the least.\r\n\r\nI feel like I'm being overly harsh - I appreciate that you have put this together but I think it might jump a bit quickly at the outset.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166689747,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42860-8cb376ad-6d35-4344-9a3e-8c6aa87a3a58-1566236774"}

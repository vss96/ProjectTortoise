On a sphere you can't comb all the hair in the same direction, that has also been extended to show that you can't have the wind blowing in the same direction at once. There is always some wind blowing at a cross current to regulate the speed/force. \r\n On the torus you could have the wind blowing all the same direction. If one side was cold because it was facing deep space and the other was hot because it was facing the sun there would be nothing to stop the wind from going faster and faster in a feedback loop. \r\n I hope they think to partition the regions or put in some weather controls before they build this for real.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_taej","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2595-75920e46-929c-424c-b517-5b66ce206a73-1566236759"}

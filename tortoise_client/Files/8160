There are lots of different ETFs out there for all kinds of sectors.  GLD is an ETF that invests in gold (it holds gold and each share is a share of their holdings).  There are lots of ETFs that invest in Europe.  There are currency ETFs for just about any currency you can imagine.  The cheapest way I've found to buy ETF shares is through sharebuilder.com - you pay either $4/transaction or if you pay $12/month you get six transactions/month for free and after that they are $2/transaction.  Check out ishares.com, powershares.com for a couple of popular ETF companies.\r\n\r\nThe thing I always disliked about mutual funds was that at the end of the year I could end up owing taxes even if I didn't sell any shares just due to the trading that the fund did throughout the year.  With ETFs this is not an issue - you only owe taxes for gains when you sell (of course if the ETF pays dividends you'll owe taxes on that as well).","created_utc":1165296083,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_ctlov","id":"ctnkv","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"UncleOxidant","retrieved_on":1473807772,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8355-6b1871f6-db49-45c4-9cc5-0a0d913ecd8b-1566236760"}

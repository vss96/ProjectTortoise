Is casual media consumption and mass marketing of negative imagery and self destructive themes to people, children or otherwise, something to get upset about? It is to me. \r\n\r\nObviously not so much to you. That's your call. One man's trash is another man's treasure.\r\n\r\nAm I advocating a ban or censor? No. I just want people to be aware of what they are endorsing. eg. You want to smoke. That's great. Don't exhale near me and be very aware of the damage you are causing to yourself and others. You can deny there are significant effects all you want but that doesn't make it so.\r\n\r\nAs for what's being marketed? The movie the genre and acceptance their of into your experience. Did you ever see the Coca-cola campaign where they attempt to have you associate the drink with key moments of your life, in other words to have the consumer associate important times with drinking the soda. This video is marketing along similar lines and it is effective because the casual person doesn't view it as marketing. This is the future of marketing on the internet and in general. If you like I can link you up with vast amounts of research on these techniques from marketers themselves.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34422-b68b7dc0-b5ab-4886-8d0a-bccf81d4878a-1566236771"}

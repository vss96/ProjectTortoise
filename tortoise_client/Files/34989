{"body":"If you want to roll things from scratch, Python is probably your best bet thanks to WSGI. The Python community has long had the problem that solving the Web Framework problem is just too much fun, so everyone went their separate ways about it meaning huge amounts of duplicated effort. WSGI directly addresses that problem, by giving people a common interface to reinvent their own wheels against in such a way that their code can play well with others if they decide that they don't want to solve generic problems like profiling or hooking in to a web server.\r\n\r\nRead this: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/09/27/introducing-wsgi-pythons-secret-web-weapon.html\r\n\r\nWSGI really is Python's secret weapon - pretty much every important Python web framework or library has compatibility with it now, and the network effects from all of that interoperable code are starting to kick off. If you want to roll your own solutions without having to solve every problem, WSGI is the way to go.\r\n\r\nI say this as a co-creator of Django - obviously, we'd much rather you got involved with that ;) But if you really want to go your own route, using Python and WSGI is a great compromise.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0co","subreddit":"programming","ups":24,"score":24,"created_utc":1167087786,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"simonw","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cw0cp","id":"cw0em","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809375,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50233-f92f98b1-5aee-4adb-b635-80420b8d187c-1566236778"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Erlang and Perl.  Yeah, someone else posted the same two languages :)\r\n\r\nErlang is my language of choice when I'm either doing something algorithmic or something where I need a bulletproof solution.  C++ is too low level.  Other languages working the same territory as Erlang--like Haskell and OCaml--are too rigid and old-fashioned (no way to reload code in a running application, for example).\r\n\r\nI use Perl for quick and dirty coding or for things that play on Perl's strengths.  I've used Python, yes, but it's too cumbersome for banging-out all the little tools I write over the course of a project.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_vzw8","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167185679,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"j_hague","parent_id":"t3_vzw8","edited":false,"id":"cw3yh","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809442,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52150-787125e6-02f7-4605-8e2e-1d4e5cd3ee5d-1566236778"}

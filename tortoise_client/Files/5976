They belong in a free-market economy the way sand belongs in toilet paper.\r\n\r\nBut what Stiglitz doesn't mention is the way new treatments would be developed in a free society.  If rich people - who get most of the same diseases as the rest of us, and don't seem to have any special inclination to roll over and die of them - were free to pay for and use personalized custom research, and there were no patents, the rest of us would be free to mooch off said research.  And we would.\r\n\r\nGranted, this is not going to result in cures for, say, malaria.  And this is where charity has a real role to play.  (Whether charity works best when it's run by the Man, as Stiglitz seems to believe, is a separate question.)","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51509-75434f38-1a8d-43ef-aa42-d8c78634256e-1566236778"}

Completely rational thinking - if you want to hack on other people's stuff, be prepared to let them hack on yours.  If you're angry about the technological measures that the media industry uses to impose their view of copyright in a vigilante manner, you should be ashamed that you have just proposed the same.\r\n\r\nBy all means, I believe they should refuse to distribute non-GPL drivers if they wish - people that want them can get them elsewhere.  I even believe they should write this patch, and distribute it disabled with the kernel - some people may want to limit themselves to GPL.  But to outright disallow an end user from loading non-GPL drivers is just idiotic.\r\n\r\nAlso, am I imagining things, or does Debian print a warning whenever a non-GPL driver is loaded?  And, didn't certain companies put a GPL flag in their drivers to avoid the warning, even though the code wasn't under the GPL?","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166106276,"ups":5,"score":5,"subreddit":"programming","id":"curle","parent_id":"t1_cuqkz","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"CommonTater","retrieved_on":1473808521,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27969-243f472f-748e-4db9-9d3a-6cb0b7b40ea3-1566236768"}

And PHP5 has added enough nice stuff (i.e., _autoload, static variables, PDO, SOAP, XML libraries, etc...) that has prevented me from moving it over to Ruby.\r\n\r\nI love coding in Ruby, but RoR is web applications on training wheels AFAIC. It's nice if your project can be shoehorned into the Active Record/CRUD philosophy of doing things, but deviating into custom stuff (and if you do want a cookie-cutter style site, you can just DL &amp; install from numerous PHP applications out there) you end up fighting the system and the benefits of RoR are quickly siphoned away. \r\nAnd the big benefit touted by RoR seems to be as foolhardy as all the people back in the day when I coded on mainframes  who championed code generators -- as I stated with my PHP5 framework, coding up objects takes about an hour more than RoR approach, and I'm not locked into \"opinionated software\" mode of thinking. But that's done once, initially, and thereafter, modifications are a breeze. Any web development project can grow into a cesspool of entanglements, but that's a developer choice. True, PHP can lend easily be used (more so than Ruby), especially by amateurs, to realize such a fiasco, but it can be used to craft quality software.\r\n\r\nThe one big advantage of Ruby (and Python) would be ability to enact more functional programming, but for most web applications, not a large concern IMO, but down the road, it could make a huge difference in producing polished, large-featured customizable applications.\r\n\r\nPython -- I can't get pass the incessant declarations of \"self\" in instance methods. The whitespace is cool (unless your team has members that foul up with tabs in their editor of choice… …TABS TO SPACES PLEASE!) but the visual clutter of seeing \"self\" declared all over a class block drives me batty.\r\n\r\nFinally, one note is that PHP &gt; everything else in terms of deployment. Not for us wizards that can set up a web server and define our own environment, but most of my contract work has been for business/organizations that rely on inexpensive web hosting, where even in some cases, only FTP is permitted. Here, it may be a nightmare to deploy RoR or Python framework.\r\n\r\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167165763,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51658-d49eb596-ff91-476b-87e3-335dd30dd1a5-1566236778"}

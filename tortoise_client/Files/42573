Hardcore environmentalists began to scream shrilly, as hardcore environmentalists are wont to do in the early 90's. No one is likely to applaud when they say, \"I told ya so.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earth Summit in Rio happened in 92'. That event lead to the eventual ratification of the Kyoto accords by most nations on earth. Had the leaders of the industrialized nations on earth taken action then, perhaps the feedback mechanisms wouldn't have kicked in. Even a reduction in man made greenhouse gases to 50% of the 1990 levels in the absence of feedback would take hundreds of years for the planet to reach a new equilibrium at those levels. Now that the feedback effects have kicked in, it's anyone's guess how bad this will eventually be. \r\n","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wey2","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58598-405bbf56-1a82-4af8-8bbb-5d3dacee58f2-1566236780"}

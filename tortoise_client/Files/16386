For example, if I tried to save to a directory that wasn't writable, it might say:\r\n\r\n1. Choose a new location\r\n2. Make it writable\r\n3. Fix your filesystem and try again\r\n4. Forget about it.\r\n\r\nAnd this was actually usable!  (The rest of the IDE wasn't, but that wasn't really LispWork's fault - stupid Motif.)  I liked it a whole lot more than error handling in most contemporary Windows program, where it would usually say \"Error writing\" and leave you to figure out what the hell was wrong and how to fix it.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_teza","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5052-af77d73e-d8c9-4ac0-b59d-9533fe355c31-1566236759"}

The first fucking thing you do is insult me for having a different opinion than your own.  \r\n\r\n\r\nYou'll easily judge me for an opinion, and assign a value of zero to my life because you disagree, but yet a selfish ass who causes grief for his family and friends and takes for granted the ONE thing we should hold most sacred gets your caring and respect.\r\n\r\nMy lack of compassion for a jackass who selfishly kills himself has nothing to do with my compassion in general.\r\n\r\nI do more for the REAL less fortunate than give lipservice.  I highly doubt you do.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;\"The human mind is a complicated thing, sometimes it goes a bit crazy\"\r\n\r\nYea, the \"crazy\" people I feel sorry for, the sane.. not so much.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808471,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cuou2","parent_id":"t1_ctyzb","edited":false,"author":"gormly","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26773-0009d73a-310b-4957-b789-241c7ac4e816-1566236768"}

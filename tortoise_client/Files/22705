{"body":"Because you don't know anyone who talked like any of this was important is not a logical argument denying the importance of these things.\r\n\r\nThe question is this.  Looking at all of what I have spoken about this reality, not fiction, do you really think that when you look at the plight of blacks in this country the main concern should be how much this is costing us?\r\n\r\nIf blacks aren't aware of this perspective it's because they live sheltered lives, they aren't being educated as to their true history, they have no idea what they have lost because they are trying so hard to survive in this wasteland without their culture which has been striped from them. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately most black people aren't even aware of what has been kept from them.  When they have children they don't even know what to pass on to them, so they pass on this diseased culture, if they are wise they filter it, but most don't even have the tools.  So instead their seeds feast on the disease of this culture of oppressors.  What should they hope to grow up to be? Successful Americans, that's like growing up to be a rich dog.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v38q","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166386555,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rahrahrah","edited":false,"id":"cv4xm","parent_id":"t1_cv4eb","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808774,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34368-20af6fef-0b12-4bbf-b796-90c64ef4083e-1566236771"}

I lost them in March of this year - After 2 1/2 months of phone calls with irresponsible American Airlines representatives, I got a letter from their customer service dept. saying that I took more than 48 hours to report- I reported the luggage missing as soon as I arrived in Tampa. Anyhow, since them I have told friends and family to not fly AA - Some friends are joining my boycott. My opinion: DO NOT FLY AA, THEY ARE VERY IRRESPONSIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO LUGGAGES.\r\n BTW, they only refunded 200 dollars for the suitcases.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v9pl","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808890,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvb4c","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v9pl","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37495-498e4b21-e130-466f-9c96-e879326fb5c2-1566236772"}

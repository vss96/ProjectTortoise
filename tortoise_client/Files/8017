The only magic with $ is its low precedence, it's basically a way to avoid typing lots of parens.\r\n\r\nAlso, $ is just a normal operator, which means that it's first-class.  This can be surprisingly handy - sometimes, I like to put a bunch of functions in a list and then do `map ($ x)` to apply each one to a given value.\r\n\r\nIf your functions all have the same type, you can also do `foldr (.) x [f, g, h]`, which is a nice concise way of building dynamic pipelines of functions.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808658,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cuyvy","parent_id":"t1_cuwv8","edited":false,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31531-7500fcc4-48c9-4a93-a67e-544275ed1dd0-1566236770"}

Yes it's the 70's again, revisiting the time of love vs use of force, and Neil Young once again is leading the cause for peace. I join him and many others by adding my 2 cents with this simple home made video.\r\nThis song is also a protest song against violence on the home front including domestic violence, racial tension, homelessness,fraud, co-ercion, theft and generally the use of force to attain what one individual/ group wants or desires from another individual/ group. The free exchange of ideas and values is what this song is about. Is what I hope our world can become. Searching for peace on planet earth.\r\n","link_id":"t3_tfez","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807619,"distinguished":null,"author":"ntrnaut","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_tfez","edited":false,"id":"ctff4","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4650-555eea95-fc56-4b1e-91f4-3511c44bbf83-1566236759"}

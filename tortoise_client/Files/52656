Both your links are about the *tourism* web site before it was changed; Saudi Arabia didn't grant tourism visas to anyone before 2003 or so.  That implies that the Jews in Saudi Arabia are (all?) foreign skilled labor.\r\n\r\nI think it's easy to understand why few Jews would choose to live in Saudi Arabia, especially given all the anti-Jewish sentiment.  However, that's not even the case everywhere in Saudi Arabia, or in the peninsula.\r\n\r\n&gt; People in European-influenced societies expect policies to be spelled out.\r\n\r\nIn practice, though, that's not the case for this sort of discrimination.  In the UK and France, at least, (I don't know much about other places), if you have two people with equivalent resumes, applying for a job, the one with the non-Muslim name is more likely to get it.

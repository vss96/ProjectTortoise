The level of simplicity really depends on how well the structure stays \"in key\".  Audiences have gotten progressively more sophisticated and can understand much more complicated structures than they could, say, in Mozart's time.  That's why music isn't just math.  A good composer has to feel out how much dissonance his audience can take.  Simply, there are people who can handle bands like Sonic Youth.  There are some that chalk the music up to noise.  In fact, every generation of listeners tends to chalk the next generation's music up to noise, when the truth is the next generation is bound to be a more sophisticated audience.\r\n\r\nBut simple isn't bad.  Even really dissonant music starts from a solid base of recognizable structure.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807773,"gilded":0,"id":"ctnm8","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tn3v","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8379-77ecb8d0-3123-4c0a-a61f-5933f09a435b-1566236760"}

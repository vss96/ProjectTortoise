{"body":"I don't think peace and issues of right and wrong have much to do with religion.  There are people that do good things and people that do a lot of bad, and you can't tell the difference by knowing their claimed religion.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the tenets of a religion aren't much of a guide, either.  You still have to decide for yourself which ones are basically correct, and which ones are malevolent nonsense.  For example: You're a Christian and you hear a supernatural voice telling you to slaughter your child to show your loyalty.  Should you do it or not?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vsvh","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1166894063,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvusk","parent_id":"t1_cvtpv","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809268,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47427-8ccff2c9-3db7-4888-a9e3-4f8bc6dbbe3c-1566236775"}

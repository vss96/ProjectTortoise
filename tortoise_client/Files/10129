{"body":"I want to know why so many parents consider it a right to force their annoying children on everyone around them.\r\n\r\nDo I have the 'right' to cry and shout around randomly? How about noise other than children? What if instead I randomly blast rock and roll into a crowd, is that OK? Where is the line on how much noise I am allowed to inflict to everyone around me before it's no longer OK according to the thinking of parents?\r\n\r\nI'll be honest about my position. I think that once you've passed the line from \"annoyingly noisy\" to \"actually hurting people\" you've committed assault and should be treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis means that I think that if you cry or shout anywhere near someone with migraines or other sensitivity to noise you should be sent to prison.\r\n\r\nI'm all for legalizing crack cocaine, so I'd be hypocritical to say that children should be illegal. I think, however, that it should be treated like other things which can hurt people. Thus, like guns and knives it's fine to own them and use them, but if you hurt another human using them you should be in trouble. \r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ubmh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165808911,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Excedrin","id":"cue0m","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuckf","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808268,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21431-d918df94-0654-41a9-829b-90456b343a5c-1566236765"}

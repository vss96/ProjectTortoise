These sites are plainly infringing. Registrars are negligent to register them at all. \r\n\r\n\"Hahaha,\" you say, \"it's not harming anyone. Information wants to be free, etc.\" \r\n\r\nWell, then you can enjoy listening to stories from your friends who go to paypa1.com, paypa|.com, paypol.com, and on and on. Everyone you know can see through those? Oh good, so when unicode domain names roll out, you'll all be ready for paypаl.com and pay‍pal.com. (Bonus points to the first person to figure out what's wrong with the latter of those two.) \r\n\r\nI say, the burden here should be on the registrar. We pay them money to put numbers on to a list in a database. That's the easiest possible job imaginable. How about we ask them to do a little more and not register sites that are ripping off other people's IP? Let's make the registrars partially liable for infringement. That will give them an incentive to do the bare minimum due diligence, which will ensure that a) there are fewer subtle phishing sites b) no scuzzy porno sites when a kid types yaho.com or whatnot c) no idiots making money off of ads on goooooooogle.com (this last point isn't a big deal, I just think if we can cut off social parasites without other ill effects, we should).\r\n\r\nMind you, I do think there is such a thing as fair usage of other people's site names. For example, googlesucks.com and googlewatch.com or googlehater.com and googlefan.com are fine. But gooogle.com is straight freaking rip off, and the registrar who allowed it to go through should bear some of the blame for it.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3118-57598ee0-dab8-4ab9-a207-2cea21327efe-1566236759"}

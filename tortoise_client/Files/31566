If you know any Forth, you'll be familiar with the form `xxx IF aaa ELSE bbb THEN` which executes `aaa` if `xxx` is non-zero, and `bbb` otherwise.  Factor appears to have a syntax for expressing blocks of code as a single reference, thus: `[ aaa bbb ccc ]`  So the `if` word, for example, expects three items on the stack: a flag, a block of code for the true branch, and a block of code for the false branch.  In Forth this requirement would be expressed with a stack diagram thus: `(??? f true-blk false-blk -- ???)` (the question marks demonstrate that the stack effects beyond these top three arguments are undefined).\r\n\r\nIt looks fairly clever, but it still hurts my head.  I'm happy with LISPish and Algolian syntax nowadays, thank you very much!","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vkrw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166681381,"score":3,"ups":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42712-57026ef4-206b-4f81-8d52-21e44bde6871-1566236774"}

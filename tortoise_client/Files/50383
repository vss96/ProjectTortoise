Personally, I feel that MySQL is not easier to run at all.  Without something like phpMyAdmin, MySQL is pain to administrate.

But keep in mind, I started on PostgreSQL, so I didn't have to unlearn MySQL.\r\n\r\n(The reason I started on PostgreSQL is because the first time I explored these programs, I had a Pentium 100MHz FreeBSD box, and MySQL was too much of a resource hog to even compile.  I easily compiled and installed PostgreSQL, as fate would have it.)\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5214-98092202-5d7e-408a-9851-9271f22e4dd6-1566236759"}

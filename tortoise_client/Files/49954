As an atheist, I can't be BSed one way or the other that any of those three religions (Islam, Judaism or Christianity) are any more or less intolerant, violent, pious or any adjective than the other. Religion always has been and will continue to be a front. A way to justify or legalize actions that a group of people want to take to advance their own agendas or to get themselves more power. And since people are all the same, so too are the religions that they create.\r\n\r\nI do think it's important to note the statement: \"...whenever Muslim regions are conquered, such as in the case of Palestine...\" Is he admitting that Palestine has been conquered by the Israelis? Because if that is true then they would have had to be attacked (in order to be conquered), and if that were true then Palestinian violence would have to be looked at as \"defense\" and \"resistance\" and not \"terrorism\" as most anti-Islamists would like to regard it as. If he believes \"Double standards do not make for international justice.\" then he should ask for what reason has Israel been allowed to \"conquer\" a people who were minding their own business living in their own land and villages before Israel was created.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807828,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctqf8","edited":false,"id":"ctqix","author_flair_text":null,"author":"llmikeb","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9643-26a125a6-016d-4679-849f-be807a97243d-1566236761"}

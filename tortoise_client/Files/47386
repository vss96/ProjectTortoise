If you're going to bother typing in the \"mkdir -p tmp/a/b/c\" command, you may as well drop the \"cd tmp/a/b/c\" test in the first place.\r\n\r\n3) The -C option to tar already creates the folders if they don't exist, so there's no reason to test and create it ahead of time.\r\n\r\n4) If the directory actually existed, you'll be in the tmp/a/b/c directory already when you run tar, (thanks to the cd) which is obviously not what was intended, since the tmp/a/b/c is specified by -C, which means that the file will get unpacked to tmp/a/b/c/tmp/a/b/c\r\n\r\n5) The \"-C\" option was specified between the -f option and its argument, so that tar will try to unpack the files named \"tmp/a/b/c\" and \"archive.tar\" from the archive named \"-C\"\r\n\r\nDid I miss anything? :)\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nI just noticed that \"Listing 11\" is even funnier, since it does all sort of random things that are clearly not what the author intended, and for no good reason.  I can definitely say *don't* do what this guy does.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808649,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_uxd7","edited":false,"id":"cuyed","author_flair_text":null,"author":"slb","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31286-343769ee-1a4d-43d7-bbe2-5f5be1878e0c-1566236769"}

I had the courtesy to provide the figures to go with your speculation, and they didn't back you up. \r\n\r\nThey don't back you up either. They're just numbers, and not the numbers we need. Not even approximations of those. We were discussing why someone would not murder again... the fact that they don't murder again hardly says that it's because they've become in any way enlightened. Common sense says otherwise.\r\n\r\n&gt;If you want to argue that the majority of murderers are incurable, you're going to have to do better than your say-so.\r\n\r\nWell, murderers have a well-deserved stereotype of being the murdering sort. We have thousands of years of history of murderers, and thousands of years of human experimentation on how to achieve justice. Some of it has to be tossed, because those experiments resulted in execution, others though, we can keep. And out of all of that, it would seem, they never get cured. They don't spontaneously recover. There are millions of reasons and none at all for what they do. And yet you're suggesting that doing nothing at all might be a cure. You've neither theorized on just what causes them to murder in a way that previous theories can't account for, nor have you discovered some mechanism in their brain/mind/soul/spirit that could be corrected to keep them from doing so. I believe I am correct, when I state that it is for you to prove, not me.\r\n\r\nIt also amuses me that you can intellectually believe that their lives aren't forfeit, that they have rights and deserve to live a real life, and yet feel relatively little for those they have killed or would kill if treated leniently. It makes me think this is an intellectual exercise for you, and that you wouldn't care if you did turn out to be wrong, since it was never more than just a puzzle.\r\n\r\nSome of us don't have that luxury.","controversiality":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165380360,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10772-c10a7127-e3c7-4c6a-9493-e53ec5264efa-1566236761"}

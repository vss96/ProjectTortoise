I mean, I could have translated the first sentence with just my knowledge from high school. Compare that to say Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, or any of the other languages that are actually different from English in a significant sense and you'll see just how hard the problem is. Even human translators have to make a lot of guesses when translating between languages that don't have the same concerns. \r\n\r\n\"Shoot, should I say he or she in this language? The original language isn't specific!\" \"Grr, how many are there? The source language has no plural, but the target has a singular, dual, plural distinction!\" \"Wait, should this guy be respectful to that guy or not? I'm not sure who's the boss of whom, but in the target language politeness is a part of the grammar!\" etc.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808160,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu89f","parent_id":"t3_u7pv","author":"earthboundkid","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18291-a9e06053-536f-4f95-8eb3-6262e887e682-1566236764"}

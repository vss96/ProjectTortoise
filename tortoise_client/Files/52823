{"body":"While nowadays I take most of my class notes using Onenote on my laptop, I still love to write by hand. It just feels so much more organic and natural - I somehow seem to gain more connection with the words I am writing when I do it by hand. My cursive is okay, too, so perhaps that makes a difference, yet I think we are depriving students by not making them learn to write by hand.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is we can't always have a computer with us, and we will always need to write little notes, or lists, or sign our name, and there is nothing nicer than receiving a hand-written thank you note when you give a gift to someone. Handwritten, attractive cursive is much more personal than cold, efficient printed letters. So, we should still be teaching our students effective penmanship. Just because we have computers now doesn't mean we should lose basic skills out of laziness.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_u170","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165650344,"score":0,"ups":0,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_u170","edited":false,"id":"cu7s8","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808150,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"18098-a2b5b64a-1daa-4365-8619-1ea5f902fa24-1566236763"}

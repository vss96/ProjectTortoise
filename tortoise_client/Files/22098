Get it? Just because I look at porn doesn’t mean that I can’t become excessively aroused by someone you’d consider “the girl next door”. I didn’t say that I watch it just before or during the act, nor do I try to reproduce the uncomfortable and often ridiculous positions. The difference is a level of animal magnetism.

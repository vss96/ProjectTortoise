As such, the riots didn't induce an exodus but rather were, at least in part, a response to the conditions that exodus created.\r\n\r\nThe larger issue was that the United States collectively decided that cities ought to be places where white people worked but didn't live.  The idea was that suburbanites would commute to their jobs in the morning, then drive home again in the evening.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this idea unraveled as businesses moved out to the suburbs to take advantage of lower taxation and to be closer to their suburban workforces.  In Detroit and other cities, this created a death spiral:  City taxes were constantly increased to backfill the tax revenues lost when residents and businesses moved out of the city; those still in the city who could afford to leave did so to avoid the ever-increasing taxes, leaving behind the poor.\r\n\r\nYour other point, however, is well taken.  Great cities are places where people both work and live.  So-called mixed use creates a population density that precludes the need for, indeed even the usefulness of, an automobile-centric way of life.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808549,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cut4r","parent_id":"t1_cuqfk","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28768-45bb575a-5f7b-4e2e-9854-3f16c4cadd75-1566236768"}

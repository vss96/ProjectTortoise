The goal is to win in the courts and get ID into science classes where young people can ignore it like they ignore everything else in high school.\r\n\r\nThe test that ID is going to ultimately fail is the practicality test.  ID \"theory\" can never be used to build any technology, while evolution can.  No amount of \"ID research\" will change this because ID posits no understandable causal mechanism.  Without an understandable causal mechanism, nothing can be built that harnesses a phenomena to practical result.\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808531,"gilded":0,"id":"cus3v","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cus0a","author":"api","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28215-ef009062-6c4f-4fb7-8ace-541ca3d6cdbd-1566236768"}

All they've apparently done is a round of rate-my-baby, and then concluded that, because the mothers scored 100% on the my-baby-looks-like-its-daddy question, it must be because the mothers are afraid daddy thought mommy may have been sleeping around.\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily wrong, but I just don't see how it follows from the data. You might just as well conclude that mothers are afraid daddy won't bond with the baby or that they are appealing to daddy to take care of the baby and not leave her for that slightly younger and more attractive primate.\r\n\r\nOf course the article may be lacking (not uncommon for science correspondent trying to sell their stuff on the free market).","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tl4m","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807736,"distinguished":null,"author":"bstard","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_tl4m","edited":false,"id":"ctlns","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7402-ec05c6aa-c3f0-4668-8b83-da4d039995b7-1566236760"}

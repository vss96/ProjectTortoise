UN Resolution 242 which effectively ended the Six Day War was accepted by all parties except Syria. Israel signed the Oslo Accords in good faith, promising to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza to allow Palestinian self-rule; Yasser Arafat, signatory to the Oslo Accords, publicly renounced peace shortly afterwards. It should be noted that this was the 2nd time Israel had withdrawn from territory in an attempt to achieve peace, the first being the Camp David Accords. These facts are public record and not in dispute; this author conveniently glosses over these facts to make his case.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166667503,"score":7,"ups":7,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42360-8a21353c-cce5-4a72-a86a-0569a3fdfc24-1566236774"}

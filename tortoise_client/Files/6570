So I went along with the lie.  He had hinted for the last 3 years or so that he didn't think Santa was real, and this year he flat out asked for the truth about Santa, so we told him.  Although I might have preferred to be honest from the beginning, consider this:  when I was growing up, I was always taught that Santa was not real.  Yet all of my childhood, I wished to be raised like \"everyone else\", believing in Santa and the Easter Bunny.  So, which is worse, to be lied to about Santa, or to grow up feeling like an outsider?  I think the latter is worse.","ups":6,"score":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166811095,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45823-adb8ebc2-49f0-4e4e-a358-3585d33155b6-1566236775"}

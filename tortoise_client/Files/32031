They're sold for slighly less than the market cost for locally made clothes. It's not that the local industries need protection from foreign clothing manufacturers, they just can't compete with someone who is selling a product that they got for nearly nothing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if these clothes were sold for the cost of transporting them there it would benefit them. Perhaps if they didn't come in at all the local industry would flourish and get to a point where they could be competitive with the companies in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc, that currently do most of the clothing manufacture. As it is, they get the worst of both worlds- they continue to bear most of the cost they would normally bear for clothes while local industry suffers because it can't compete with clothes whose manufacturing costs have basically been subsidized by the original owner.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vo79","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809216,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cvs1f","parent_id":"t1_cvpi9","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46009-506122cc-886d-4f76-b7af-48ebaed253eb-1566236775"}

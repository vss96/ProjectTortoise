{"controversiality":0,"body":"I believe the first two problems involve a frequency analysis of the decryption attempt. If you're decrypting to any human-readable format, you'll know you've got it when you don't have any control character codes (ASCII 0-31, minus the typographical ones) left. Similar things apply to other formats (raw video/pictorial data has a very regular \\color{3} or (hue)(sat)(lum) format, or something similar.) The problem comes when we get into compressed formats (ZIP, but also MP3, JPEG, etc.), which have qualities that make them similar to still-encrypted files in terms of brute-force analysis length.","link_id":"t3_uz8g","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166239735,"score":6,"ups":6,"author":"derefr","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuzlj","id":"cuzqt","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808675,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31936-0a6aa28e-1ea7-4575-b8b8-2812551c8207-1566236770"}

{"body":"Well, on the Haskell side of things, I think it's only fair to mention that &gt;&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;&lt; are not builtin parts of the syntax. They're just ordinary functions which are part of the library I was using.\r\n\r\n(Aside: More accurately, they're general Hughes Arrow combinators that are part of the Control.Arrow library, which HXT bases much of its abstraction on.)\r\n\r\nJust for the sake of clarity, [ and ] are just the brackets to specify lists in Haskell, (just like python in that regard), and -&gt;, &lt;-, and -&lt; are parts of case, do, and proc-do syntax. (the -&lt; is meant to resemble the tail of an arrow, and usually goes along with &lt;-, as you can see there.)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_vebh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166564937,"author":"cgibbard","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cved4","edited":false,"id":"cvezb","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808963,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39416-5b9b088b-e879-4d0a-b139-d8b36bbe1904-1566236773"}

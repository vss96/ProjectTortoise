They used to matter, but they don't any more.  The new Turbo Delphi/Win32 is a magnificent piece of work, *so* much more usable than Visual Studio in every way, but it still has little bugs and limitations from Delphi 1, carried forward because the communication between customer and company died in the mid-1990s.  And they're nowhere near producing a version of Delphi with the sort of features you expect from modern languages.  It's better than any Microsoft language, but that's about all you can say about them.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vzym","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50395-5d81987d-ff6a-400a-9c75-090b5c3478f0-1566236778"}

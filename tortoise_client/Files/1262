{"body":"Good reply ghhardy.\r\n\r\n&gt; we discriminate against people all the time.\r\n\r\nHere it seems you are, usefully, using discrimination in a forth sense:\r\n\r\n4. Discrimination: choosing people on some basis.\r\n\r\nFurthermore we do use the word in this sense often enough.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we choose people on some basis all the time.\r\nIt is true too that \r\n&gt; we certainly don't ban all discrimination against people.\r\n\r\nAnd rightly so.\r\n\r\nWe don't ban all choices for or against people made on some basis. Another innocuous example: you might call one friend and not another for your picnic. Nothing inherently wrong there.\r\n\r\nThere are even innocuous examples of racial discrimination, choices made against people on the basis of race. If we are remaking \"Roots\" we might discriminate against Tom Hanks, on the basis of race, for the part of a slave.\r\n\r\nThen, I hope my revision of defn 3 makes things clearer:\r\n\r\n3. Discrimination: choosing people on an unjust basis.\r\n\r\n&gt; it certainly isn't easy to draw a general line on what is an acceptable factor and what isn't, and moreover such a line, if it could ever exist, changes with society.\r\n\r\nI'd offer that the general line, of how we determine whether the basis is unjust or not, is whether the factor is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThe relevancy of the factor is time independent.\r\n&gt; Should the army allow women to be on the front line? Is gender here an irrelevant factor?\r\n\r\nNo. Whether in the 21st or 19th Century the relevant factor is ability to perform the task.\r\n\r\n&gt; What about their thoughts on say black people; particularly, if the person is a stated racist, should that be relavent in hiring the person?\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\nLet's make the example stronger. Let's say the person is not merely rasist, believing in particular generalisations about race, but believes that unjust discrimination on the basis of race should occur.\r\n\r\nEven then their beliefs should not count against them being hired. Their political beliefs do not prevent them from peforming their task in a manner that does not unjustly discriminate on the basis of race. Concretly, Jill can believe that blacks should not be allowed in the car park but nevertheless be hired to operate the boom to allow all regardless of race, in.\r\n\r\nThat new forms of unjust discrimination are uncovered over time is proof of moral progress.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tnpi","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165376032,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"johnbentley","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctr5j","id":"ctscl","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807862,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10631-99a76054-d923-4373-a816-04abf3303002-1566236761"}

And sometimes vice-verca: Malaysian passports say in them that they aren't valid to enter Israel. \r\n\r\nNon-Israeli's can have problems entering these countries if they have visas for Israel or sometimes even exit stamps from countries neighbouring Israel in their passport--my grandparents, like many well-travelled Britons, have two UK passports each for the purpose of getting into both Israel and countries that don't recognise Israel.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wcfe","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167427229,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"keithb","parent_id":"t1_cwe53","edited":false,"id":"cwebe","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809638,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57527-7e8267b2-7ef1-4e48-b1b4-2d5560d93e3f-1566236779"}

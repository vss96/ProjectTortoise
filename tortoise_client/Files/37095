There were a lot of developers that attended the event. One of the things that impressed me was what well-rounded people were employed by Google.\r\n\r\nSince much of the conference was a discussion of group dynamics, you'd expect that if Google employees were really as infantalized as this article makes it seem, these discussions would have been terribly shallow. But much of the really profound stuff I heard discussed was by the Google employees.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that strikes me as odd when reading this article is that when I was there (the summit was on a Saturday) there were a lot of families on the campus. I saw areas that had bean bags and toys being used by the kids. I mean, there were a lot of kids there. So I didn't think anything odd regarding the \"kid stuff\" because they were being used by kids.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808554,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cutb4","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_upux","author":"pottedmeat","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28864-bd7663ac-1565-4515-8e90-d7577c7c0a02-1566236768"}

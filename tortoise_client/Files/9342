He should've stop right there. Instead he went on and produced huge pile of garbage.\r\n\r\nOpen Source software is not free. You pay for it. Pay with your contribution.\r\nOpen source is the model of business where developers give away software for unlimited use to unlimited number of people, in hope that a very small number of people will contribute code back. And that is EXACTLY how it works, and how those open source developers gain profit. By being able to use work of others FOR FREE.\r\n\r\nThis actually means that such open source developer does not create that software for sale, but creates that software for use in his business. Business that brings him money, be it inhouse application, or even application for sale, where he sells something else (not code). For example he sells consulting services, or deployment, or hardware where software is just a part of a package.\r\n\r\nVery viable business model.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165891538,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cuing","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uhet","author":"vagif","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808356,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23892-00017d14-9130-4f86-8249-f2e4c69c5430-1566236767"}

The latter is the much harder one, and from my experience it takes a few years of reading about them/using them to get a sense of where and how to apply them.  They can be incredibly useful, but only for certain things.  The one thing they excel at most is classification, which means you take some set of data, and you want to recognize certain properties of it.  So for instance imagine you've got ten images of apples from various angles, and ten images of oranges from various angles.  You want the neural network to be able to receive an image of an apple or an orange and its output will be a classification of which it is.  You set this up by training the network on examples, and then using it on data which is similar but not identical to the examples.\r\n\r\nNeural networks are great for this kind of work, which is generally how they're applied, for things like voice recognition, image recognition, all kinds of pattern classification in data mining, etc.  They're definitely far from ideal when it comes to algorithmic operations, largely because you have to add some kind of temporal layer to the network, to process things in a certain order.  This is a hotbed of modern neural network research, something I'm working on personally, but it's by no means an established methadology.  Hope this helps.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3846-fb6e37a8-ebfe-41b8-82b6-012e59c334fe-1566236759"}

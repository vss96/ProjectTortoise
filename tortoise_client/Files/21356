I know this because I'm IT manager for a company that offers home owner loans, I thought quite hard about taking the job but think I made the right decision.\r\n\r\nFor instance over here if someone wants to take a loan we send them proof versions of all the paper work to read and are legal obliged to have no contact with them for seven days so they can read it and decide. They can't even sign those copies they are only for reading and understanding.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day people have to accept the blame for their decisions though. If someone takes out a loan secured on their home they should be sure they can pay it back. \r\n\r\nBut like I say the rules will be different in the States.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1164976063,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1027-76faca59-7f81-499b-bfb5-db46c194c0c2-1566236758"}

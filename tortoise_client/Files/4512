{"body":"This was done *inside* Disney's park.  If they don't want you running around their park dressed as Santa Claus, more power to them.\r\n\r\nImagine if they just let free-lance Santas into the park.  Now imagine one of them does something inappropriate with a child.  I know this sounds over-the-top, but Disney **must** protect children on their grounds.  \"Child molested at Disneyland by Santa Claus\" would be major damage to the company.  They can't have kids flocking to strangers.\r\n","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vciv","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-2,"ups":-2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166544158,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"danweber","id":"cvd8o","parent_id":"t1_cvctr","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808930,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38469-48265966-905d-4543-82eb-6451e63ef46c-1566236773"}

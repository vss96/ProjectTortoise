Though its not effective for all numbers (like squares of large primes). Factorize a number till you get a list of all its prime factors. If the factors occur in pairs then replace them with a single number. The product of those numbers is your square root. \r\n\r\neg.\r\n46656 can be prime factorized into:\r\n2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3\r\n\r\nReplace each pair with a single digit giving us:\r\n2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3\r\n= 8 x 27\r\n= 216\r\n\r\nOf course, this technique can be extended to nth roots very easily. For every n repetitions of the prime factor, replace it by a single one and take the product. \r\nEg.\r\n2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3\r\n\r\n= 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 (Taking 3 repetitions)\r\n\r\n= 36 is the cube root of 46656\r\n\r\nSimilarly it follows that 6 is the 6th root of 46656\r\n\r\nThe obvious hassle comes in the factorization. If the prime factors of the original number are too big to be calculated by hand, then of course you are in trouble. :)\r\n\r\nHaving your divisibility tests by rote is very helpful during factorization.. \r\nhttp://www.jimloy.com/number/divis.htm","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22639-dd33dc1b-f5e2-4798-b8a2-f8bc5631baa6-1566236766"}

Should Spez and the rest give back the money to Conde Nast that they made by selling Reddit? After all, it only took a year or so.... \r\n\r\nThe value of IP is not the time it takes to create - it's the demand for it. Reddit's sale price wasn't some calculation of hours put into it, but rather of the value of the community and what they can do with the technology.\r\n \r\nLikewise, if 4 million people want to listen to a song it has more market value that a song 400 people want to listen to, regardless of the time it takes to pen the song. \r\n\r\nWhat the labels have done in the past is promotion and distribution. Promotion makes us aware of an artist that we might not otherwise know, but its value is to the label and the artist, not us. Distribution is trivial with digital music. So, if an artist can achieve broad awareness without labels, they could sell their music directly. However, no one has really mastered how to accomplish that.

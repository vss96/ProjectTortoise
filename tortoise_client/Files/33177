Even I, a non-snob, can tell the difference between a 20$ bottle and a 8$ bottle.  However, I have trouble telling apart the 80$ bottle and the 20$ - the difference in quality is less.  A thousand dollar bottle is similarly so, and often the expense is due to the rarity rather than the quality.  Is wine drinking a signaling game at that point? Probably, but there is still a quality differential.\r\n\r\nIf you are a victim of such a signaling game that you describe (you buy the 1000$ wine and it turns out to be repackaged 10$ wine) and the cheat is pointed out to you (or you laud your own taste and refinement in front of those who know), you are humiliated and lose utility (enjoyment, as you put it).  Preying on the information asymmetries in a market and using deceptive marketing in the way Noka does is absolutely immoral.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wb48","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809628,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"RSquared","parent_id":"t1_cwd7k","edited":false,"id":"cwdqq","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57188-b2451905-8576-4aad-ac4a-69f6c2d1da2d-1566236779"}

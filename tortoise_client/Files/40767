Specifically, large multinationals that make a large proportion of their revenues abroad yet have a large proportion of their expenses at home.  Coca-Cola's a good example: 70% of it sales and virtually all of its sales growth comes from international markets (including a large China segment), while much of its expenses come from marketing and product development, which involve paying people in US$.  Altria (Phillip Morris) is another possibility, or big pharma.  It shouldn't matter whether the stock is denominated in dollars, as long as their *business* is international.\r\n\r\nOf course, another issue is that stock valuations in general are pretty high right now, largely because global trade has meant strong earnings growth for everybody over the past 5 years.  If the dollar devalues, it might cause worries of a recession or depression, which would make stocks fall.  And stock prices usually adjust faster and more dramatically than currency prices, because they represent expectations of total *future* income.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tkm9","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8943-9ccdfe7c-f761-4bb1-a5c3-7747346b71cf-1566236760"}

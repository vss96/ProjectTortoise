These man produce dominant forceful, offspring, and so on.\r\n\r\n* Women like to pick and choose their partners - getting raped is bad from a biological perspective, because it denies mate-choice. *But* having sons who are rapists might turn out to be genetically advantageous, if rape results in reproduction. This tension might result in a preference for guys who are *bit* rough rather than genetic dead-ender milquetoasts.\r\n\r\n* [edit:] Hence the best sex of all for a woman is forceful sex from a man she's hot for anyway - she gets both mate choice, and rough, reproductively successful offspring - and this is what the original author was talking about.\r\n\r\n* Women have varying preferences - it has been shown that women tend to prefer effeminate men most of the time (nice guys, who hang around and take care of the kids), but switch to masculine love-em-and-leave-em guys when they are fertile (the thought being that the nice guy then helps with the kids). \r\n\r\nWe are what was evolutionarily successful, not what we would like to be morally.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807586,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_tcpy","edited":false,"id":"ctdrm","author":"anonymous-coward","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3931-5ea37096-465c-4678-9d49-1d81112c0f19-1566236759"}

{"body":"It's not a question of compilation (regex engines are either NFAs or DFAs, a few rare ones such as TCL's regex package being implemented as dual-strategy engines) but one of implementation.\r\n\r\nMost Regex engines are NFA, because a lot of advanced constructs (such as lookahead/lookbehind) cannot be expressed by DFA engines.\r\n\r\nGet the \"Mastering Regular Expressions\" book, it holds much knowledge on both the craft of writing regexes and the inner workings of RE engines.\r\n\r\nBecause of PCRE's complexity, CL-PPCRE is either an NFA or a DFA-NFA hybrid, I don't think a pure DFA can implement complete PCRE.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uf2g","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":17,"ups":17,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165839362,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"masklinn","id":"cuf9p","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuf7s","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808291,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22095-09b7f878-5e42-470b-8a40-eab9e00e0cb0-1566236766"}

The oracle gave a description of a kind of house with a number of geographical details.  Three houses in Tibet were found that met the description.  A group of monks went to each house with a collection of items, some of which were previously owned by the Dalai Lama, some of which were randomly selected.  When they arrived the current Dalai Lama greeted some of the monks who had known the previous Lama as if he knew them.  When they laid out the items, the current Dalai Lama selected all of the items that were associated with the previous Dalai Lama, and none of the others.  This did not occur at the other two houses.  There are a number of other remarkable details as well.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other similar cases of such things in TIbetan Buddhism.  \r\n\r\nYou might not want to believe in reincarnation, but there are many data points that make the idea seem plausible.  If you only disbelieve since it doesn't fit with your worldview, then you might want to consider that you are sacrificing facts to protect your cherished worldview.  Which is more important, clinging to your concept of the way things are at the expense of facts, or being open to facts even if they require revising your worldview?\r\n\r\n-added-\r\n\r\nPerhaps modding me down to hide from ideas that threaten your worldview is satisfying, but it looks very sad.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vo8v","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809155,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"FelixFelis","edited":false,"id":"cvosx","parent_id":"t1_cvofw","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44415-5aae5c56-2ca3-4ca0-94e3-0c79c4915bca-1566236774"}

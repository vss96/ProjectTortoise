As people have stated, the question is whether or not its worth it when condoms can do a better job (60% vs much higher than 90% plus protection from other STDs).  The working theory involves Langerhans cells in the foreskin.  They evolved the ability to pull fragments of viruses into the body to prime the immune system but with HIV they just bite off more then they can chew.  This means that even without an open wound these cells pull HIV into the body and raise the risk of infection significantly.  There's also the benefit of significantly lowering the risk of your partner getting cervical cancer to consider as a benefit but I don't think either is an automatic answer.  Realistically we'll have a pill/shot to immunize for (viral origin) cervical cancer widely available within the year so the \"prevent cervical cancer\" arguement might become a moot point soon.  As for HIV, its certainly a benefit but if you use condoms and aren't man-whoring yourself around too much that benefit will mean nothing to most people.\r\n\r\nRealistically speaking yes, there are benefits, but they only benefit the minority of people and a little bit of diligence can easily make up the difference so it really falls to personal choice.  If you aren't responsible with your own health or that of your partner's then yes, this would benifit you.  If you are responsible then the benefit is going to be mitigated by your actions.\r\n\r\n/thad","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27145-f620099c-053b-4abb-a1de-b80fab5636fa-1566236768"}

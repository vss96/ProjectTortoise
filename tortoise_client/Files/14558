Most of the time my reason to submit on reddit is to hear what a certain group of people have to say about it. It's not clear the group would immediately migrate to a new subreddit.\r\n\r\nI understand where you're coming from. I've had the impression that programming.reddit's growing for a while now, and it is perhaps approaching a [fracture point](http://reddit.com/info/msp5/comments/cmz6s?context=5&amp;style=nested#cmz6s) like the original reddit.com where the community can no longer agree on what is interesting and everything but lowest-common-denominator stuff gets downmodded into oblivion. Hence my comment about automating the process of monitoring communities and forking them.\r\n\r\nFWIW, some references to this conversation elsewhere:\r\n[1](http://reddit.com/info/dxrk/comments/ce034)\r\n[2](http://features.reddit.com/info/jxwx/comments/cm2sq?context=5#cm2sq).\r\nI'm pretty sure I've seen the apocryphal comment by spez, but I can't locate it now.\r\n(update: ah, [found](http://features.reddit.com/info/229o/comments/c22c8?context=5&amp;style=nested#c22c8))\r\n\r\nI arrived at my policy over time ([eg](http://reddit.com/info/gg2w/comments/co2jr?context=5&amp;style=nested#co2jr)), but I'm not dogmatic about it if we can find a better solution.\r\n\r\n'*' - And if anybody who matters still reads request.reddit. That's prob the _biggest_ if.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wjhy","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60193-3983a775-a506-4050-99b0-484494fec0ba-1566236780"}

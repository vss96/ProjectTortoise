Many nazi war criminals were tried and executed, while many were also tried, and simply given time in prison before their eventual release. The Americans made a simple, realistic offer: either be tried for your crims, or come work for us. \r\n\r\nThe justice of which you speak might be optimal, yet the rough edges of life often demand more. Also, I think it perfectly logical to assess that in certain cases, legal punishment might not be the most beneficial course of action. Which course would have been more logical to take? If you had decided, would you have had these brilliant minds tried before a court and executed, while you faced the spectre of a growing Soviet threat?

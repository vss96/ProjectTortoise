I suspect they bought it because it is most likely one of the few torrent clients that have no external dependencies, except a socket, which Ludde probably abstracted away anyway. They bought the source, which they'll happily move to other platforms. uTorrent will slowly bloat as Netscape-style-managers move in to wrap it in shit. Ludde will laugh on his way to the bank, and someone else will write another free, small torrent client.\r\n\r\nJust the way it goes.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808036,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cu0x2","id":"cu1rx","edited":false,"author":"sunbeam60","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14838-32df9b0f-e211-47dc-b5a7-8f94320c69ec-1566236762"}

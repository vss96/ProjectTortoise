I saw the disgusting video of the 8 year old girl swearing and showing hatred to anyone who beleives in God --- knowing absolutely *NOTHING* about these things (as you just said) -- and so I would add \"atheist\" to your list of \"You can make a kid just about anything.\" -- Truth is, you cant. Once a child grows up, they will be their own person. Period. I am my own person, you are your own person -- regardless of how you or I were raised. I agree wholeheartedly that no one child or otherwise should be *FORCED* to accept any belief, however -- that is NOT what is going on in this video, or in church, or in Christian summer camps. What is going on, is a gathering together of Christian kids, who call themselves Christian kids, to worship God and to live the life that they have chosen. They are not forcing ANYONE to be there, you dont see any kids begging to leave, you dont see any kids being forced to stay. You are the one forcing your belief on us Christians saying that taking our kids to church is wrong.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ua04","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808205,"author":"CarlH","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuape","parent_id":"t1_cuana","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19644-e4185a2b-6018-4481-b49e-298c5dd21d3f-1566236764"}

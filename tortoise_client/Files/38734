If you can know the future with certainty, then does free will exist?  If you have the choice of two actions, but you actually choose one of them, was it an illusion that you could have chosen the other one, or would your brain chemistry have forced you to always choose the one you chose?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe in the concept of free will.  I think our brain chemistry will give us certain predispositions and biases, but I don't feel \"compelled\" to act one way versus another.  For instance, because you are predisposed to become an alcoholic or a child molester, does that mean you have to do so?  It's an interesting discussion with no easy answers, but I suspect most people believe they have some degree of agency in their choices.","retrieved_on":1473809038,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvi5o","id":"cviqh","author_flair_text":null,"author":"beowulf","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41335-17c69130-0566-4c8d-bab7-e820d73500e0-1566236773"}

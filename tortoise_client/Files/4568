{"body":"I’m thinking of Ruby, or at least my beginner’s knowledge of it.  *a = lambda { foo }* being different from *def a() foo end* confuses me. The lack of wholehearted Unicode support (yet) frustrates me. The syntax feels arbitrary.\r\n\r\nIt has a lot of tools to work with, but more than that I want a lack of holes to work around.\r\n\r\nI know Ruby isn’t a bad language, because smart people are doing interesting things with it. But when I try to do things in it, it seems like I end up spending more time trying to find documentation on how the magic works than on actually writing. I’ve decided that Ruby and I will have to agree to disagree until we’ve both matured a bit.\r\n","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w0ju","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167154320,"author":"celoyd","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cw1yh","id":"cw2kx","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809415,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51387-26494575-e073-4c4d-98e9-82929bc6be51-1566236778"}

Each type of launch really directly lends itself to a specific type of launcher. It's not that the shuttle sucks -- it's an awesome piece of technology -- it's just that it was expected to do more than is reasonable. It should not be NASA's only manned launch option, and it should not be NASA's only heavy-lift launch option either. It should be just another tool in the toolbox.\r\n\r\nI just hope that no one gets the idea from the cancellation of the space shuttle that reusable vehicles are automatically not viable. In a robust space program, I suspect they would have their place. Returning delicate things back to Earth is something that no other space vehicle, present or planned, can do. If the shuttle had focused on that goal it would've been much cheaper and even if it wasn't, they could avoid using it except when necessary. But it's still capable of doing things and carrying equipment that simply wouldn't be feasable on a non-reusable vehicle.\r\n\r\nI guess given the choice I would rather have a cheap very-heavy-lift than any of the other types of launch, but I don't see why we can't have more than one type of spacecraft available.","link_id":"t3_ujzj","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165943323,"score":24,"ups":24,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25119-8715141a-bf72-4d34-a114-a66664eae077-1566236767"}

I've got three links in the parent post that say you're wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd as for this:\r\n\r\n&gt; Then, of course, there is the undeniable fact that the only thing that makes driving at the speed limit dangerous (from a being rear ended perspective) is other drivers breaking the law and driving faster.\r\n\r\nYou need to read up on the Prisoner's Dilemma. As an individual driver, on a highway where everyone else is going 10-15 MPH over the limit, what are you supposed to do? Get everyone else to slow down? Your only choices are to drive at the same speed as everyone else, which is safer but leaves you open to getting a ticket, or to drive the speed limit, which keeps you from getting a ticket but is more dangerous.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809083,"gilded":0,"id":"cvl4u","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvkxi","author_flair_text":null,"author":"raldi","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42586-7266fb16-753d-4d95-8836-985873f54d09-1566236774"}

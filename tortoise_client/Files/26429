{"body":"I'm not so much of an expert, but the solution code they give is... odd.\r\n\r\nTake the first two exercises.  The trivial solutions for them would be\r\n\r\n    (defun my-last (list)\r\n      (last list))\r\n\r\n    (defun my-but-last (list)\r\n      (last list 2))\r\n\r\n(Note that my-but-last is somewhat misleadingly named, since Common Lisp's butlast function does something rather different.)\r\n\r\nIf I was to implement the functions using only Lisp \"primitives\", they'd look something like this:\r\n\r\n    (defun my-last (list)\r\n      (if (endp (cdr list))\r\n          list\r\n          (my-last (cdr list))))\r\n\r\n    (defun my-but-last (list)\r\n      (if (endp (cddr list))  ; Somewhat bad form, but still readable.\r\n          list\r\n          (my-but-last (cdr list))))\r\n\r\nTo completely replicate Common Lisp's last function (and do it in O(n) time), I'd do something like this:\r\n\r\n    (defun my-last-2 (list &amp;optional (n 1))\r\n      (labels ((my-last-r (cur-list result count)\r\n                 (if (endp cur-list)\r\n                     result\r\n                     (my-last-r (cdr cur-list)\r\n                                (if (plusp count) result (cdr result))\r\n                                (1- count)))))\r\n        (my-last-r list list n)))\r\n\r\nSo my opinion is that the exercises themselves seem decent (in particular, it's a common thing to have people learn about Lisp by implementing some of its functions themselves), but the answers to the examples seem a bit amateurish to me--if I were learning the language, I'd want to be able to compare my code to code written by someone more experienced than me.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_uh01","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165957248,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"phil_g","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cujz7","edited":false,"id":"cumb9","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808424,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25618-87be4d52-88a8-4c8c-9f1a-88543f8b77cd-1566236767"}

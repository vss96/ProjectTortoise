It is aimed at people who are already pro-NRA (and \"white, Christian male authority\").. And those guys will probably not see the difference..(ie presence or absence of police protection) Or use the '*absence (or inadequacy) of Border Security/INS*' as a corresponding excuse..\r\n\r\nActually, that NRA novel has a \"Why Cops Canâ€™t Touch Them [gangs of illegal immigrants]\" section on page 13 of the PDF file (page 22 in the \"novel\")\r\n\r\nAnd, NRA, in that ridiculous \"novel\", is also advocating just that, guns for self defense.. \r\n\r\nWhile I do believe Hampton was a great speaker and (incl. others like Malcom X) had good intentions, I am pretty much a follower of Gandhi-MLK Jr. school of thought and my criticism is limited to just that,..use of violence.\r\n\r\nedit: Stupid Markdown syntax","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w7hi","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54335-177ff187-b945-4aee-a821-80d6c790a6bc-1566236779"}

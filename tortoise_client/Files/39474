Those hustlers are nothing but aggressive professional beggars. You see them right as you walk out of Cairo Airport and one of a bunch of them might jump at you to grab your bag right out of your hand and run with it to the Taxi line a few yards away then expect a hefty tip from you, even though you didn't ask him to, and in fact, even resisted heavily and the experience traumatized you a little. You don't have to be a Jew to be treated that way; any tourist suspected of being naive or fragile can get the same treatment from them, in fact, especially so the Gulf Arabs as they are perceived to be too rich and too family-sensitive when walking with their veiled women to endure the persistent harassment of a determined and rude hustler.   \r\nYes, those hustlers are overrepresented because they just chase the tourists, but that would be like saying that London muggers, some of my friends have fallen victim to them and their knives, are representative of British manners. \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5619-a1b0027f-d7ee-4940-ab91-bca37d2b3c4a-1566236759"}

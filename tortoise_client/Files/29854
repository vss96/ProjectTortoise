It's headquarters are in Palo Alto, for chrissakes. I don't see people refusing to collaborate with Americans because of Iraq, and I wouldn't think much of someone who cuts contact with, say, Iranian or North Korean developers because of their government's actions.\r\n\r\n&gt;SECURITY THROUGH OBSCURITY .. DOES NOT WORK\r\n\r\nWow. Such revealing insights from \"an open-source advocate\". You really must tell us your blog URL. Have you any idea what the discussions where about at all? The argument is whether to enforce certain interfaces or not. There are many issues, of how much you want to limit the programmer, backward compatibility etc. \r\n\r\nNO ONE tried to gain security via obscurity, and your little karma whoring post (attacking Israel, Microsoft and closed source all in one - should make you a Reddit king I reckon) is completely baseless.\r\n\r\n[ps. As an open source *developer* for the last 7 years, I'm personally fucking tired of \"advocates\" who contribute so much noise and so little signal]","link_id":"t3_uvnj","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166249434,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32097-3922f0ac-ac19-4d4d-9a1e-16d75d9085e8-1566236770"}

Because of this, I typically don't respond, but I really want to address some of your comments. First, I'd like to say that when you steal something, regardless of your intent, your still breaking the law.  If you stole the drugs to save your ailing mother or so you could get your fix doesn't matter, you still broke the law.  If you killed someone in self-defense or if you killed your wife in a heat of passion, you still killed someone, you will still be arrested, and you will still go to trial.  The rules clearly state that you cannot be in possession of a firearm and he was.  His intent may get him expelled for one year instead of two, but he's still gonna have to answer for what he did.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I cannot accept the fact that future instances of this type of behaviour should be eliminated from the discussion.  Precedent matters.  If you choose to make exception for this student, the basis for what behaviour merits exception is pivotal in order to justly respond to potential future incidents.  The answer may be to eliminate zero-tolerance policies, but that isn't the discussion I think we're having.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the school is proclaiming that what he did was not the correct and responsible decision.  The school has clear policy that \"being in possession\" of a firearm is prohibited and he was clearly in possession of a firearm.  Here we have come full circle to intent and again I claim that his intent doesn't matter particularly in light of the school's zero-tolerance policy.\r\n\r\nRegardless of zero-tolerance, he broke a rule - an extremely important one at that.  I think the kid should be shown some mercy and I honestly feel bad for him.  He tried to do some good and now he's getting punished, but, like stealing for a \"good cause,\" this is in direct opposition to the rules.  The rules aren't a secret and neither is the zero-tolerance policy.  The school must reinforce the fact that touching a firearm is not allowed.","link_id":"t3_uvo6","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808629,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Th3_C0bra","id":"cuxay","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uvo6","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30725-cdb616ed-f04b-48e0-8641-ce80145f95ea-1566236769"}

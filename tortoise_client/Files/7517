{"body":"I spent several weeks playing with haskell recently. I enjoyed it a lot, and the community is fantastic (#haskell is the dream channel) but I definitely struggled when it came to monads. Once I started working on slightly less trivial programs, I pretty much found that every function I wrote had to accept something wrapped up in an IO monad, which meant that the whole program had the same problems of side effects that imperative programs have.\r\n\r\nI've decided to put haskell aside for a few months and return to this problem with a fresh perspective, since there's obviously something I'm missing. There's tons of monad tutorials out there, and many of them are very good, but I never got the sense of how to properly use monadic with non-monadic parts of the program.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_wg2y","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167496596,"author":"gravity","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_wg2y","edited":false,"id":"cwgrc","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809683,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58748-e72338b5-7af5-43aa-823f-3bfa45ae5e7d-1566236780"}

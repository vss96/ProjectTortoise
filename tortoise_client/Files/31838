In each case, the parents paid the down payment, and often the mortgage.  Actually, the roommates effectively paid the mortgage, since their combined rent was often greater than the mortgage payments.  The parents pocketed the difference (if it goes to the kid, financial aid eats it all, while if it goes to the parents, financial aid only eats 33% of it).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v88c","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38527-6723b8ce-75de-42a7-92d3-3af375ff7ea0-1566236773"}

But after reading this monstrosity, it is clear the author has negative course credits in his legal education.\r\n\r\nOn the most important issue facing those who wish to seek impeachment, this piece makes no sense. Did he really title a section \"Bush has not committed perjury\"????\r\n\r\nPersonally I think it is imperative that Congress make a strong case for the legal justifications of impeachment before undertaking it. And let me make it clear for those who will comment after me; while those legal justifications may exist, David Swanson does an absolutely atrocious job laying out what those might be. He instead runs off to spend the majority of the article refuting the \"political\" arguments to not seek impeachment. Those arguments should be a far secondary consideration in the process.\r\n\r\nIn anycase there's no reason to lay out the reasons in comments to follow, the point is Swanson failed to make them himself. This article fails to adequately address the most important issue in the entire \"debate\" over impeachment.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u8kq","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165686920,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18699-d35725db-76f1-4389-82af-cdfb25ebcc35-1566236764"}

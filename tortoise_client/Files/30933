The ipod CAPITALIZED on affordable (somewhat!) small hard drive densities and napster of the early 00's to create what the masses didnt know that they wanted before (they just used better marketting). I  had a car mp3 player at the time the ipod came out, and things like the rio were just too expensive to be practical. Ipod marketting changed that and people were prepared to spend $500 on an mp3 player. Now that memory has gone down significantly, everyone else can have a cheaper mp3 player than the ipod. THis is why san disks line of wonderful sanza products is succedding so well.\r\n\r\nAnd for my sanza, it acts like a usb flash drive in windows, so I didnt have to install anything to get it working. It just worked (tm), on a single aaa battery that you can buy in any country in the world.","retrieved_on":1473809755,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cwkm0","parent_id":"t1_cwjhk","author_flair_text":null,"author":"keithobambertman","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60688-278dedeb-44bb-4825-bbc0-336c93bcd4b4-1566236780"}

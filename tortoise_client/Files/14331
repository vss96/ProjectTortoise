I think answering those questions would require some serious snooping - gathering usage statistics about all the users, trying to analyze the general tone of users' comments, etc etc.  You really think transparent voting would do all this?  I think it'd give you a bunch of unentangle-able data.  Would be interesting, yes, but not necessary.  I imagine it would actually lead to *more* speculation, as assembling data into meaningful patterns can often create so many different perceived meanings...\r\n\r\nAnd if there was a way to figure out if reddit users really are all a bunch of anti-Israelites (as some reddit users claim) (worse than the general population, that is), that would be interesting too.

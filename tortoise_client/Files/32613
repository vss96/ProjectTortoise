I've had to bite my own tongue at friends weddings when that sort of thing is said. One phrase that sticks in my mind was \"there will never be peace on Earth until all mankind embraces Jesus\". I'm not sure if that was an observation or statement of intent.\r\n\r\n&gt; If whoever wrote the Jewish Bible thought they were doing good, their morals must already have been somewhat shot. \r\n\r\nYou have to view it in the context it was written. People needed to be told not to marry their oxen back then. The Old Testament was written to make the Jews pull their shit together during some very dark times. Lewis Black, a Jewish comedian, does an [excellent skit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jCCam6l9GY) on this. Highly recommended viewing, the bit on the Old Testament starts around 2:50 on this clip.\r\n","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166464362,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36267-b29cddb3-f5bd-4c02-b6e9-61bc32413e3e-1566236772"}

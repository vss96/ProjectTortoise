Big whoop.\r\n\r\nI have to disagree that FUD can mean any kind of disagreement though. IMHO, FUD is when a person expresses fear, uncertainty and doubt basically due to ignorance. That is to say, that the F, the U and the D is entirely or mostly based on lack of knowledge on the issue.\r\n\r\nCalling \"FUD\" is to point out that the person in question is basing his/her critique on lack of knowledge and is just venting \"feelings\" as opposed to substantial critique.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_us7b","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":-3,"ups":-3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166129199,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28838-51b72fe8-3089-420e-af98-3c490fc321e7-1566236768"}

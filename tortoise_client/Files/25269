Or in simple terms, if I eat your sandwich, your plans for lunch are ruined.\r\n\r\nGiven that you and I can't both eat your sandwich, there are essentially two ways to handle the situation.\r\n\r\n1. We can squabble, politick, steal or fight, by muscle, by gangs, by ideologies, by fiat of law, etc.\r\n\r\n2. We can agree who has absolute ownership, and agree to deal only by consent, withholding force unless someone breaks the pact.\r\n\r\nNumber 2 is the root of property, of free trade (in which inducements are offered to persuade exchange), of justice, of individual liberty and of world prosperity. It's the only possible political system in which normal life can and does proceed without force, actual or implied. Nothing could be more moral, or more practical!\r\n\r\nThe really free market *is* the abolition of power.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v1ex","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808729,"author":"JulianMorrison","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cv2kr","parent_id":"t1_cv2e1","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33139-befecdb1-bd6d-4232-8945-fa091914303a-1566236770"}

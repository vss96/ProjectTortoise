I thought it was my left shoe, but my anger was misdirected at it. The right shoe is the one that really pissed me off.\"\r\n\r\nAre you serious?\r\n\r\nMisdirected, for example, away from the fact that our President spies on us without judicial warrant, and towards the fact that Michael Moore is fat.\r\n\r\nMisdirected, for example, away from the fact that our President has made us into a nation of torturers, and towards the fact that one of the Dixie Chicks said that she was ashamed that Bush was from Texas.\r\n\r\nMisdirected, for example, away from the fact that our President has held American citizens indefinitely without placing charges against them or giving them access to lawyers, and towards the fact that some stores put up signs that said \"Happy Holidays!\".\r\n\r\n&gt;Using latin phrases doesn't make you smart.

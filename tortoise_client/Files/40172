The mechanism for this positive selection is that it confers upon the organism the capacity to analyze it's environment and to engage in long-term planning.  The ultimate consequence of these capacities for planning and analysis is to grant the organism the ability to choose courses of action that alter the environment such that the threat of otherwise potentially lethal environmental factors is wholly or partially mitigated.  Environmental factors that applications of the intellect can mitigate include but are not limited to starvation, weather, predators, and disease.\r\n\r\nIt was not my intent to suggest that the PROCESS of evolution had any purpose what so ever, but rather to suggest that the TRAIT of the Intellect served a purpose.  Further the purpose the Intellect serves is so favorably selected for that the process of evolution has lead to it being fixed through out the entire Human population (in the field, we referred to this as 'purifying selection').  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, a more precise explanation is both lengthy and needlessly complex for the scope of the above discussion.\r\n","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wcfe","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809635,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Lucretius","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwdu7","id":"cwe5u","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57446-7eca8ed2-5367-41f0-9e13-f63048dc11d1-1566236779"}

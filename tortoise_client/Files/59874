An war of conquest requires a certain amount of ruthlessness &amp; bloodlust. you kill anyone who gets in your way, you provide total security to the point of dictatorship to the people you conquer. any upstarts or rebels? you kill them immediately and without question or doubt. you find a civilian aiding the rebels? you kill them and their family to send a message.\r\nThis is not something you can do in a democracy like ours, it's bad news, and bad news travels fast and has pictures &amp;  carries survivors in it's wake. We got into the war on a pretty flimsy claim, and we have hog-tied ourselves &amp; our military over it in the meantime. (course i could go on and make an argument that the US military isn't really suited to  occupation either, but that's a discussion for another time).\r\nI hate the idea of \"cut and run\" but i think 'erhaps it's for the best :/ \r\n\r\n--vat\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59124-2fc89540-ee39-45c7-97ab-5729137789d6-1566236780"}

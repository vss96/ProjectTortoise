{"controversiality":0,"body":"They satirize all of american culture every week and you call that second rate? \r\n\r\n\r\nI disagree with this whole thread. They take plenty of strong points on things. Almost every episode is layered with references and culture from the usa. They are picking certain phrases and positions which if you analyze them, make a point in and of themselves. I listed some above (http://reddit.com/info/tpok/comments/ctqzs) . If you did watch the show, they usually have a \"moral minute\" near the end, where they play a \"connecting with the morals\" song and have stan or kyle recite a small monologue about what they have learned and so forth. Usually they make a joke after that which ends the show. I think those two things combined sum up whatever message the ep is giving that day.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tpok","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165355670,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"degustimrplowstruck","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctr4j","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctqex","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807839,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9981-052211f6-1f21-40bf-86f4-3750b1634c7b-1566236761"}

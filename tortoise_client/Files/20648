If that girl had been of equal caste to the landowner, he would have done nothing at all. But because he sees her as \"less than\" he can justify maiming her for life. \r\n\r\nNow this child has to suffer the remainder of her life, and will need to do everything with her left hand - in a country where the left hand is considered \"dirty\" - over a few spinach leaves? WTF???\r\n\r\nThis guy needs to be down-casted and see how it feels. Can his caste unanimously agree to make him an untouchable? \r\n\r\nbetter yet - Why doesn't India invent a whole new caste called the \"depraveds\"? They could lump all the f**ked up people who burn girls alive, who throw acid in the faces of brides who say no, and now the ones who cut off the fingers of helpless girls, too. They could replace the untouchable caste.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0h7","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":15,"ups":15,"created_utc":1167112281,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50724-fd001d42-8561-49f6-ac04-ecae23af418d-1566236778"}

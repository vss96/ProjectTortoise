{"controversiality":0,"body":"Why does it confuse people that medieval Europeans portrayed Jesus as European?\r\n\r\nThis may come as a shock, but in Africa, he's usually portrayed as black; in South America he looks hispanic and in Japan he looks awfully Japanese.\r\n\r\nYeah, historically Jesus was probably a swarthy brown dude with curly hair. His family hid out in Egypt, right? But the people in Europe - especially Northern Europe - would not have known what Egyptians looked like. \r\n\r\nHeck, the Catholics make a point of making Jesus look like whatever the local church goers look like - to emphasize that their religion is inclusive, not exclusive.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_of_Jesus\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_udbp","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":33,"ups":33,"created_utc":1165806032,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cudwk","parent_id":"t3_udbp","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808265,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21345-55890bb1-e7ac-424b-93f8-7af6d31cb334-1566236765"}

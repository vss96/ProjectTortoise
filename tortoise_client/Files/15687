Looks remote, but the design is great.

To put it simply, many triangles make a sphere.  An equilateral triangle is the same formula that all time and space can be measured. That is where Einstein's theory for relativity became relavent. So I saw in my mind the pattern for which I used to build my house from. This is simular to the great Pyramids built in Egypt over 2000 years ago. EXCEPT- instead of 5  sides that the pyramids have { because we only see 4 sides} and never seem to remember that the base is also a side! This house has 4 sides.  Each side is measured 55ft. X 55ft. X 55ft.\"","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166198631,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cux6m","parent_id":"t3_uvpy","author":"artman","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808626,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30663-89c061c3-f7a0-4623-9693-d7771ead7af3-1566236769"}

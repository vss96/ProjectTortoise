There's no question that they were murdered.  He wasn't arrested until her body was found.\r\n\r\nSecond, suspecting someone committed a murder isn't justification for convicting them when there is no body.  At least I understood that you need evidence of murder and not merely circumstantial evidence.  Even if and when there is a corpse, that doesn't necessarily mean this guy killed her.\r\n\r\nI can \"suspect\" or \"believe\" he probably did it but until her body is found, there's really no case.

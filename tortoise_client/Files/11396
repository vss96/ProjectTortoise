Remember this was 12 years ago and I don't know where he got his facts. Maybe they are better at it today. I know people that have had the mild form of pancreatitis and they were hospitialized for weeks. The severe form disables or kills you. And when you get it any form, they can't tell how far it will go. If you've had pancreatitis once it is also more likely to return and you can forget ever drinking alcohol again.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tuzt","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12283-82295491-07df-4e3e-ac5e-44852c8bc143-1566236761"}

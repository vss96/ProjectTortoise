It is not a C-derived language. You have if, when, and unless; if has arity 2, when and unless have arity 1. when and unless are shortcuts where one of the branches does nothing. The * variants are like anaphoric macros in Lisp, where the true branch receives the value of the condition as an input. This is useful because in Factor, anything that is not f (f is a singleton) is true, and f is false. This is like Common Lisp's nil, and unlike Scheme where only the two singletons #t and #f have truth values.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vkrw","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42670-5ec484bf-c75a-46e7-955c-e0bb90ec6910-1566236774"}

Historically, it has been defined as a legal prohibition of saying or printing a class of material as defined by the legal authorities. This implies a negative obligation on the creator, i.e., \"you can't do that\".\r\n\r\nWhat you're describing, on the other hand, is not a negative restriction placed upon the creator, but rather the lack of a positive obligation upon the owner to broadcast his content. Non-owners of media channels (and by this I mean the infrastructure used to broadcast, not the airwaves themselves; that's a whole nuther ball of wax) have no inherent right to access those channels beyond what is granted to them under contract with the owner. I am not being \"censored\" if the reddit crew decided to remove all my comments from this post. You did not have access to MIT computer networks in the 1970s if you were not a student; you don't get access to them now simply because an internet grew up around it that they helped grow.\r\n\r\nThe definition of censorship from the point of view of the consumer of media, whereby censorship is \"filtering content according to the interests [of a number of large companies]\"  is loose and very easily co-opted. Spammers can easily argue, for example, that ISPs' use of filtering software and hardware is censoring their messages as delivered to the millions of people they wish to reach - whereas the ISPs would simply argue (correctly), that while the creators (of spam) are using the ISPs' infrastructure, they must abide by the ISPs' rules.","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165353285,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctqxj","parent_id":"t1_ctqc9","author_flair_text":null,"author":"rafuzo2","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807835,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9887-6aa536af-2652-4f8a-9009-71769e624714-1566236761"}

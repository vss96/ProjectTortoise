Apparently, the guy had tried to sell it for a while to no avail, when he decided to put a \"take me\" sign on the car. I drove by right after he had put the sign on and was walking to his house. I stopped, and asked the guy about the car. To have a title transfer work, you need to charge something for it, so I gave him a dollar, and he signed it over to me. I drove it off his lawn right then and there. Drove it for 3 years (!!!) before the incident with the tow company happened. The car had seen better days by then, and I was at the point of needing to put money into it, soooo its time was up, so to speak.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54331-18ab5976-6d5d-48d8-9b7c-88e0065487f7-1566236779"}

Who decides which individuals put the good of the whole before their own good, and how? How do we ensure that those people, in turn, are making the right choices for the right reasons? \r\n\r\nFor that matter, is a willingness to put the good of the whole in front of one's own interests sufficient to produce good leaders? What about people who are well-meaning but incompetent or dogmatic?\r\n\r\nDemocracy is the idea that if you get enough people engaged in making decisions, those decisions will tend to be pretty good. Of course, it doesn't work that way all or even most of the time (consider how many elections it took before Americans finally conceded that the Republican Party was hopelessly incompetent), and the mechanisms through which people make decisions are not necessarily good aggregators.\r\n\r\nHowever, even the most flawed democratic model tends to self-correct given enough time. The \"natural governing party\" grows so complacent and corrupt that voters suddenly reject it *en masse*; or new political entities discover novel ways to communicate ideas, discover what people want, and achieve electoral success by cultivating and/or exploiting new social networks.\r\n\r\nIn the city where I live, the incumbent mayor had a $200,000 war chest, the support of the city's only daily newspaper, the Chamber of Commerce, several construction and development industry groups, and prominent members of society. He was considered a shoo in for re-election despite a three year record of cronyism, corruption, campaign finance violations, backroom dealing, kickbacks, and influence peddling.\r\n\r\nHe lost to a challenger who ran a $10,000 campaign, accepted no corporate or union donations, and posted homemade campaign ads on YouTube.\r\n\r\nThe talking heads were mystified; local activists with their ears close to the street knew different. However, if those activists don't apply plenty of pressure on the new mayor to stick to his promised agenda, he'll probably end up going with the flow as well. \r\n\r\nThe political culture discourages citizen involvement, since it's so caught up in institutionalized corruption. As a result, it's a constant uphill battle for engaged citizens to be heard and to exert an influence on policymaking. Showing up to vote once every three or four years is the least interesting part of a democracy.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tocn","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10624-a01d9ff7-22e9-437e-9a64-e0ad00fa94cd-1566236761"}

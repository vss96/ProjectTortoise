Let us see:\r\n&gt; it was not the desire of the founding fathers to create a Christian nation.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that it is true. What is following is that America was not founded with INTENTION TO BE Christian nation. However it does not denies the fact that actually people who FOUNDED the US where Christians. And with all the respect for founding fathers they did not create America alone. Most of the people who ere living in US in that time were Christians. Moreover many of them where [puritans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan). So I believe the author is wrong.\r\n\r\n&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n*Added:\r\nI would sincerely like to know why I'm downmodded?

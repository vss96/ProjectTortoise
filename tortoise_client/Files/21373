If some fascist country use some malicious tactics reminiscent of the Nazi why should we hide the fact? Why not apply it to other political overused comparisons. I find it much more annoying when people call \"communist\" anyone who cares a bit about people less fortunate in our societies.  Should we ban the use of calling someone communist with some \"whatchamacallit\" law?","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v06p","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808716,"author":"ArcticCelt","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv1oz","id":"cv1x3","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32796-52e884c0-fa73-4a08-be2b-43eb9496dd4f-1566236770"}

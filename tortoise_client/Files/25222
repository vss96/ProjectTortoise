There's two basic ways: Iteratively improve (better support -&gt; more users -&gt; better support -&gt; more users, etc.), or spend a lot of money to jump straight to first-class support (Java, C#). But few languages ever make it, and either way it seems to take at least ten years.\r\n\r\nObviously, we're guessing what \"realistic\" means, but I submit that's what it means: A language with many users and first class support. A language you can commit to doing work in without having a crippling fear that you will be unable to find people to hire to work with it later.\r\n\r\nFor better or worse, it is true that none of the functional languages really meet this bar, because they all clearly lack a large userbase. Most of them are missing first-class support, too. (To elaborate, \"first class support\" means you can design a highly heterogenous system incorporating networking and GUIs and string bashing and parsing and 3D graphics and audio and OS integration and everything else you could reasonably want without worrying about whether you're going to be able to find __any__ libraries, let along good ones.) This is correctable with time and it is being corrected, but we're still a ways off. \r\n\r\n(One indication that we're getting to that point will be when one of \"the Reddit languages\" starts taking off, and people will start thinking in terms of \"X\" and \"everything else\", where X is \"Erlang\" or \"Haskell\" or something.)","link_id":"t3_u5jo","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165647775,"score":3,"ups":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"18046-55959dfb-fefe-4f74-a65c-aea224b65b92-1566236763"}

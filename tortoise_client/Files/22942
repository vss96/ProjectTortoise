Don't keep things in the language that only make it easier for the compiler.\r\n\r\nFor example, #include.  It is just text processing, and very simple text processing at that.  Makes things harder for the programmer.  Die header files, die!\r\n\r\nAnother is forward declarations.  Not at all necessary in D.  Just write your functions in any order and have them call each other as you need.  The compiler will figure things out.  Even if it takes multiple passes through the source code.  This is what computers are good at - don't make the poor humans do it.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809360,"gilded":0,"id":"cvzlo","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vyx3","author":"khayber","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49845-6052c1de-64a9-4b42-b736-be7d41e37186-1566236777"}

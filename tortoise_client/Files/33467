MC336 is (loosely translated) Comparison of Programming Paradigms. Basically, we had a few assignments with exercises in Java (or C++), Lisp and Prolog. The idea is to learn about different paradigms and explore other languages. \r\n\r\nAt Unicamp, it went somewhat like this: Pascal for \"Intro to Programming\", C for \"Data Structures\", \"File Structures\", \"Operating Systems\" and our lab course for Distributed Systems. MC336 was the only course that we'd work with Lisp or Prolog. Other courses that had programming lab work, but were not programming _per se_ (Computer Vision, Compilers, Networking) could be done in either C or Java, depending on who was offering the course at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24570-f4051063-18c1-40eb-99b1-96f297fcdfb0-1566236767"}

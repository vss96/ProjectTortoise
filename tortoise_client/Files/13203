Once you get your del.icio.us/flickr/reddit off the ground and have your first 10K daily devoted users, then you might be able to make a bit of difference by advertising support for it.\r\n\r\nUntil then, add it to the would-be-cool-to-have wishlist.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w3rd","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809451,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw4gh","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w3rd","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52448-c9f95a5a-bf29-4eb5-9089-2a6076d7fb26-1566236778"}

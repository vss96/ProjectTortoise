Inevitably the collection cycle will run when you don't want it to and lock the machine. Having a resource you don't have absolute control over built into the language, or in the OS always always comes back to bite you in the ass.\r\n\r\n2.Writing to a virtual machine is wonderful, but we pay for hardware for a reason, and again don't tell me your software can optimize my code better, because it can't and it doesn't. There needs to be a shim layer exposed to developers to ensure that data is being marshaled and hardware routines are being called appropriately. In C++/C this is always an option.\r\n\r\n3.People that write in Python or Lisp or Haskell get the proto-type done. The call it the application but it inevitably runs slowly at some point, which means mucking about in the language/platform bindings in C/C++ to make things run better. This is not a possible in the Java world because of the restrictions on the virtual machine. Platform agnostics are people that don't ship code. Firefox as much as I like it is slow as a dog and prone to crashing because of the cross platform myth, which is really the same as the virtual machine myth. In project's like Firefox its really about rolling your own definition of what the \"virtual machine\" is and writing to it rather than using someone else's.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion.\r\n\r\n1.Garbage collection sucks.\r\n2.Not having access to the hardware platform directly sucks.\r\n3.Not having access to the software OS platform directly sucks.\r\n","controversiality":0,"ups":-3,"score":-3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166185976,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_utqb","id":"cuw5j","author":"smacfarl","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808606,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30236-6655d1c1-2c30-40fe-885d-b34549522ff3-1566236769"}

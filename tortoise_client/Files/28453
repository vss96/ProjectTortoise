I think it is a great car.  When I was shopping, it had the best combination of interior room, power, fuel economy, and price/incentives (my criteria) of anything I looked at.  The steering seems good to me...and I guess door handle placement isn't really much of a concern to me.  Sure there are problems with GM cars, but I was able to avoid jumping on the anti-GM bandwagon, and found myself a gem in the GM lineup.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59795-b2cd1a49-f9d7-436a-82a9-71abc4e95a11-1566236780"}

When stubble talks of our \"freedoms\", I assume he's referring to ideas that weren't codified into law but this nation was founded on nonetheless. To succeed, a democracy requires the free and open exchange of information to enable an informed electorate. In our society, most of our news comes through a few major channels and if these outlets are colluding with each other and the government, any reasonable person should question the truthfulness of the information that the outlets provide. This is where the letter of the law and the spirit of the law diverge.\r\n\r\nFreedom is about much more than the Bill of Rights in the same way that Judaism and Christianity are about more than the 10 Commandments.\r\n\r\nN.B.: The FCC does compel TV stations to \"say anything\". Why do you think they broadcast political debates, public service announcements, the evening news, public television, public access channels and the Emergency Broadcast System? Also, no one had said anything about the First Amendment.","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1167333105,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55339-c1a244b0-2e4f-4c0e-8f54-13b096c94a0a-1566236779"}

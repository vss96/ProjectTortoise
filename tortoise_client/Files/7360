However, I don't think the concept of colonization is wrong.  I disagree that humans are *ready* for it though. We've yet to learn how to live properly on *this planet* before we fuck up the next one.\r\n\r\nI had a conversation with one of the principle *husbands* for the \"Mission to Mars\" project and voiced this very same concern.  I do not personally believe humans can achieve interstellar flight for several reasons, including energy and resources.  But if we were to take with us to the stars our present level of \"human bias, prejudice, ignorance, and practices\", we would probably, quite soon, kill ourselves out among the space rocks.  We're simply not ready for the stars on a evolutionary time scale.  Even now, our technology is light years ahead of our ability to live here, right now, with each other.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"188-67532d9f-4d00-4495-a996-0a1a0c7abd34-1566236758"}

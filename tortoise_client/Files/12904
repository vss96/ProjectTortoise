Not only that, but when you have different storefronts in the same industry, (future shop, best buy are the best real world examples, but its alot easier to set up multiple websites) that are owned by the same person, they create the illusion that: \"price dispersion on the Internet is an \"equilibrium phenomenon\"â€”the natural state of a competitive market.\"\r\n\r\nWhen really, the same company owns 5 or 6 \"storefronts\" (or many more) all with differing prices. This creates the idea that there is a natural equilibrium, when in reality its just one marketing department and one ceo playing the numbers.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w2cf","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167171243,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51790-aefcf5f9-4eee-4f54-9d23-207ae14c6983-1566236778"}

We're in Iraq because after 9/11 we looked at saudi duplicity, Iranian support, and iraq sanctions and decided if we needed to turn the war on terror into a ground war we couldn't do it without a good base and a way to address the region while securing the oil we need to function daily without collapsing our economy.\r\n\r\nIraq sits on the border of Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia maybe you'll recognize the names as the poster boys of terrorism and jihad exports and funding.   Iraq also sits on a mountain of oil which means that out from under sanctions we could address either Saudi Arabia (impossible before Iraq) or Iran and still keep our cars filled.\r\n\r\nSeriously pull out a map and see where Iraq sits and then check out the oil reserve maps.\r\n\r\nOf course Iranian activities kept the oil output capped and Iran and Syria destabilized the country enough that our objectives couldn't be met.  But tactically it was a good choice, the same way all the island hopping in WWII brought us within striking range to japan.\r\n\r\nBut you won't get that from President Bush.   It's the truth but the kind you just can't say without committing about 10 billion diplomatic blunders.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165727950,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuasb","parent_id":"t3_u9by","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"pcx99","retrieved_on":1473808207,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19699-1bef4aa4-edcc-47cb-bb02-4c1a6dbb7da2-1566236764"}

Most of this difference was attributable to the situation among women. Whereas 23.2% of Canadian women were obese, the figure for American women was 32.6%. As well, each obesity category (Class I, II and III) accounted for a higher percentage of American than Canadian women (Table 3). The difference in obesity rates between American and Canadian women prevailed in all age groups except 45 to 54 and 75 or older (Chart 6).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for me being overweight, let alone obese, I'm one of those genetically-thin people.

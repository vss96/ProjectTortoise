Rather, *perfect* practice makes perfect.  Practice makes *permanent*.\r\n\r\nHaving taught myself guitar and keyboard since, I sort of understand what she was saying.  The point of practice isn't to mindlessly repeat the same thing over and over again, because if there's any flaw in your performance, you'll just burn it in.  Instead, you should always be consciously listening to the sounds coming out of your instrument and adjusting to make them better.  If you have difficulty with something, concentrate (literally) on that, and exercise it.  \r\n\r\n(Edit: damn, I just read the other comments, and they said exactly the same thing.  Forget I mentioned it. ;-))","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vmcm","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809149,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nostrademons","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvmo5","id":"cvoi5","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44233-ecf3aa17-0061-477c-91f6-4e9efc2dd2eb-1566236774"}

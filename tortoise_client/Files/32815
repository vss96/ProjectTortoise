I also thought it was a typo, so my mistake too. Apologies.\r\n\r\nI've based my opinion on Dawkins by seeing him speak in live interview, non-live and in shows. I really don't like the way he comes across, he actually said people had to have faith that there wasn't a god... even though he had just spent 10 minutes complaining about the harm blind faith does. Since then I just see him as a hypocrit, intelligent but with the same faith flaw.\r\n\r\nI understand Dawkins' point, and to some degree I agree and even like the guy, but he always reverts to the \"I'm right, they're wrong\" argument, which IMO invalidates his 'better reasoning' completely. Like I agree with him that god cannot exist in the universe, however science hasn't even begun to explain outside the universe and there are some cosmological constants that are extremely finely set that it becomes disturbing how big a chance the universe took to exist.\r\n\r\nThere was a good program on recently, \"The Trouble with Atheists\" (hopefully it comes online somewhere, and includes Dawkins and other 'leading' atheists) that disturbs me seriously about atheism, there are some acting like the bible-nuts they so dispise.\r\n\r\nIt was this show that showed how idiotic some of the 'leading' atheists are. One called religious people idiots, thus lowering her to the level of the religious who call atheists idiots. One ended up making crude remarks that Stalin, despite being Marxist and thus refusing all religion, was brought up religious so that's what made him evil... I mean that guy wasn't even smart enough to use 40 years of US propoganda that he lived through that the Reds are evil.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Happy Holidays to you too.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vtxd","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166925651,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48022-42660047-72e1-46f9-85e3-1ada137668ed-1566236777"}

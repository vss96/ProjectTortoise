A neural net is a processor where processing is done by nodes which compute by spreading activations between them, rather than by internal processing. \r\n\r\nYou're hearing \"neural net\" and thinking \"*artificial* neural net\". \r\n\r\nYou're also splitting hairs to avoid the basic issue, which is:\r\n\r\nIn humans, memory and algorithmic processing are not distinct, easily separable entities, but are two emergent properties from the same system. Therefore, to say that humans have a memory handicap is to ignore the fact that a lot of a human's \"game memory\" is implicit in the human being's chess-playing algorithm.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2054-0664dc63-3a50-4707-b167-c3cab55de443-1566236758"}

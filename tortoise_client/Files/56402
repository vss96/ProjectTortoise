Actually no he doesn't, atleast not in Saudi Arabia. While I was there, there had been similar cases of husbands killing their wives, in rural areas, such as \"honor killings\". All those cases, atleast the ones I heard about, were prosecuted by Saudi authorities.\r\nNow when it comes to the age-limit of marriages Im not sure what the Saudi laws are regarding that. However, I never knew any person, man or woman, who got married before the age of 16in Saudi Arabia. If it does happen, it probably happens in very rare cases (rural areas perhaps).","created_utc":1165338488,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_ctpmj","edited":false,"id":"ctpth","author_flair_text":null,"author":"baadshah","retrieved_on":1473807813,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9274-d1049e12-2099-42cd-b286-ced422887e0c-1566236761"}

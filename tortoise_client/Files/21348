Emacs supports this particular style of development with integration between the two.  I'm sure there's similar plugins for other editors.\r\n\r\nI became very accustomed to this from working with Common Lisp, where like Smalltalk, programmers tend to work within a dynamically changing environment with immediate feedback from recompiled code.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of advantages besides being able to type expressions at the prompt.  Having immediate and referenced feedback on type errors is nice.  Being able to query types and information about program identifiers is also very useful.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_viqs","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166643021,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41552-a3d8c0f8-d62c-4a0e-8e58-25aac7e841d8-1566236773"}

{"body":"Someone throwing themselves under a subway train will make news because it will completely disrupt the train service. Not something that can be quietly swept under the rug.\r\n\r\nI think the more likely explanation is that this story is a fabrication. The \"we don't want your poison\" chants sound like something out of a hokey feel-good movie. Didn't that happen in Rudy or something?  ;-)\r\n\r\nEdit: After a google search, I'm not sure I can defend my claim that subway suicides must be consistently reported. I still thought the story had a hokey movie feel to it though...\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t8jy","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164993240,"ups":27,"score":27,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"petevalle","id":"ct8y8","parent_id":"t1_ct8v4","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807497,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1506-c7c7f507-b2c8-4602-b1ba-b4ca2acb8a50-1566236758"}

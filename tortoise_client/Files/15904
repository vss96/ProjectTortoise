There's no evidence, not in the slightest, that says reincarnation can't happen and there is scientific evidence that it doesn't. How hard is it to simply open your mind and not join the hardline religious in their inability to percieve the real world and not their simplified version that makes them happy.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to point out that reincarnation has nothing to do with religion, it has to do with philosophy.

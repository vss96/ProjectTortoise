Some of the rest is explicitly violated in every CS paper, and this is as it should be:\r\n\r\nHoare: \"So never claim to have remedied some defects or limitations of this work.\"\r\nScientist: Smmith's FPN system can display 12.4 million polygons per second. Our system sacrifices some integrtiy, but can process polygons more than twice as fast: 30 million polygons per second.\r\n\r\nHoare: \"This piece of advice: don’t claim that your scientific results are useful.\"\r\nScientist: By using a combination of reference counting and garbage collection, we can run higher-level languages on embedded processors, and we can stop dealing with the difficulties of manual memory management, which Figure 1 shows to be the leading cause of software bugs.\r\n\r\nHoare: \"But remember: while you’re a scientist don’t claim to be useful!\"\r\nScientist: National Science Foundation, please give me a grant so I can so I can do more work, support some grad students, and get tenure. My work is important to society.

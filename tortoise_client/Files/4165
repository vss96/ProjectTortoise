{"controversiality":0,"body":"How can employees get money for their work without the money going *through* their company? Of course the stock will go up. Please describe to me how it could ever happen like you say.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the rather large defense contracting company where I know a number of people is *privately owned* and last I heard, they are planning on staying that way. The stockholders are largely the founders of the company and it's employees - this is the best possible situation because they cannot be forced to make poor/unethical decisions by outsiders just to inflate stock as large companies often do.\r\n\r\n&gt; Also note that some of the big beneficiaries of the war project are private companies, like Bechtel and various \"security\" (aka mercenaries) companies.\r\n\r\n* A service is neaded.\r\n* Company provides service.\r\n* Company gets paid.\r\n\r\nWTF is the problem with that? You simply object that the company provides their services to the military?","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tgql","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165376954,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctsex","parent_id":"t1_ctrz0","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807864,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10657-291b08f9-cedd-4bad-ad45-c11fdda805ca-1566236761"}

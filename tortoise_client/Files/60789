Did you know that prominent jewish leaders in pre-war europe were actively working on deportation *and* extermination of jews?\r\n\r\n Take this for an angle: the holocaust, even its name is Yiddish, is always thought of as the extermination of jews, but really, there were countless others who perished too. Do you ever hear about them in world politics? Not really. When someone says the holocaust didn't happen, he's labeled as a blatant anti-semite, but not anti-gypsy nor racist (blacks were persecuted too). What's up with that? Doesn't that strike you as doublethink?\r\n\r\n But still, it's both illegal and taboo to ever question anything regarding the holocaust.\r\n\r\n I don't think anyone (including Ahmadinejad) denies the deaths of millions of jews during that era, but I think it's an extremely fair standpoint to want to discuss more openly what happened exactly without immediately being labeled anti-semite. A very important point in this topic is the importance the Holocaust played in actually allowing for the creation of the state of Israel. And in that respect, it only makes sense that Zionist leaders would have in fact favored more persecution.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wif3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167602999,"score":5,"ups":5,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60860-8cc41e66-1555-4774-be96-47799ef328a3-1566236780"}

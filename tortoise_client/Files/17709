Do they even know the transmission method? If someone slipped it into his coffee for example, then how do you know how much of his coffee he will drink? If you only put in \"a little\", and he doesn't drink the whole cup, then he gets sick and lives, and your chances of killing him in the future go way down now that he has been alerted. Seems much better to highly dose his coffee, and if he then drinks the whole cup, big deal if you used too much. The important thing is that he consumes enough of it if he doesn't drink the whole cup.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v6w0","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808854,"author":"happyjuggler0","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cv989","parent_id":"t3_v6w0","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36500-d0d3c139-8731-4cbc-879b-6818685fec80-1566236772"}

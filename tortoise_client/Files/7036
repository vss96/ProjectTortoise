But I don't agree that it is simply visible by the line count.\r\n\r\nJava is a much more simply language compared to Haskell. It has less abstractions, a less sophisticated type system and also is much more bound to the underlying execution model of the processor.\r\n\r\nHaskell OTOH has a quite abstract execution model which requires lots of compiler magic. Also Haskell has much more syntactic sugar than Java. So we have an example for \"simple isn't better\" here (unless of course someone considers Java as better).\r\n\r\nBut if I had to solve the problem in Java, I would've first created an abstraction (which would cost about 15 lines) and then create a specialized solution to the problem (which would cost about 5 lines). So I would need about 20 lines which is to long to win your challenge - but then I had a universal solution for a class of problems. I would consider this as more important as a minimal line-count.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uzuc","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166312292,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32989-0f3dc5cd-dfb0-4783-914d-fd094efeb847-1566236770"}

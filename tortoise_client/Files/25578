If the woman is too drunk to say no when she means it, then a guy shouldn't be prosecuted if he's too drunk to make out a subtle no.\r\n\r\nBut then again, in a relationship it's hard to tell the line between someone who is just playing coy and someone who just isn't in the mood. This is even harder to tell when you're both drunk and actually share the same bed.\r\n\r\nIt would just be simpler if the police treated any complaint of rape that happened outside a house/flat/hotel (eg in public) as automatically breaking the law, indecent exposure for one, and sort out the details later. It would certainly cut the numbers of people risking it and stop the numbers of date rapes that happen in clubs. Then the police would be able to concentrate on actually sorting out rapes and not perverts simply trying to get off on an unconcious chick. Then again, I wouldn't shed a tear if someone just wiped out the scum bags that try this shit, it's things like these that make eugenics seem like an appealing proposal to sort out humanity.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wa4w","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55993-db94580d-595a-484a-be22-ab57ddea0cdd-1566236779"}

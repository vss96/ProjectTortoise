However you're still likely to get over a decade in jail.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if he was only assisting and not the one actually dealing he could have got away, with all these stacked up, to about 7 years in jail.\r\n\r\nHowever I see no reason why he should get practically no sentence. The US government is preaching how great democracy is yet their courts system is such a joke I'm surprise the US even needs a death row, this mockery makes it look like there should be gift packages for anyone who kills 5 prostitutes or more in a night perhaps a nice trip to Hawaii would be better?!","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166237367,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuzoz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uyez","author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","retrieved_on":1473808674,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31903-c79c626b-8aab-4516-a146-8d80dad56f1d-1566236770"}

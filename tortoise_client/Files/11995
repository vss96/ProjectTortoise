This is true of a number of genetic deficiencies that \"modern\" (for lack of a better term) societies compensate for.\r\n\r\nWhile a place like Africa might be able to produce the next super human as their survival needs favor that, western society might actually degenerate.","link_id":"t3_ucsv","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808268,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rancmeat","edited":false,"id":"cue0i","parent_id":"t3_ucsv","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21429-d2c6c1f8-51d9-4199-b170-0c94fe0426cd-1566236765"}

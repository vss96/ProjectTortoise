I mean illegal immigration, maybe... I mean it sure helped them sort out the problem with Jean Charles de Menezes, wait he ended up dead as a terrorist not deported as an illegal immigrant.\r\n\r\nMaybe it'll work against identity fraud... except unless it also happens to check all bank accounts registered in your name and everything else about you I somehow don't see how CCTV works to protect us against that. Well unless they start dealing with everyone like they do the illegal immigrants when they're suspected of anything.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50015-73718e93-bbf2-43d2-a3aa-ff6c67bbcb26-1566236778"}

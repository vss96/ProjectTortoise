{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ugue","body":"This report is sheer nonsense. If anything, schools are less likely to exclude a 'black' pupil rather than a 'white' pupil who has misbehaved to the same extent. The report, as written, does not seem to mention lack of parental support, nor the culture of disrespect to teachers and violence towards other pupils that exists. Blaming schools is the easy option for pseudo-academics who are unwilling to address the real problems.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165863996,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cugvv","parent_id":"t3_ugue","edited":false,"author":"igeldard","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808321,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22903-a154e0f6-1459-4ccd-bc0b-60e26ea26d79-1566236766"}

The (.) is just function composition, as in your example. Its identical to writing:\r\n\r\n    do stream â‰º- getContents\r\n       writeFile out (gzip (encrypt (unicode stream)))\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; What specifically can be done with a monad that cannot be done with normal OO programming?\r\n\r\nThey're unrelated concepts. Monads are a fundamental abstraction over evaluation order. That is, a monad lets you specify in your code what evaluation order a particular code fragment should use, be that: imperative, stateful, continuation-based, backtracking, nondeterministic or [something else](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad#Interesting_monads).\r\n\r\nI'll refer to one of many previous discussions here in this area. In essence, [you can abstract over the evaluation order](http://programming.reddit.com/info/ox6s/comments/coxoh), letting you restructure the basic evaluation mechanism of your language, using libraries alone.\r\n\r\nIts a foundational computational mechanism: particular languages usually just pick a particular monad and that's what you're stuck with (i.e. the List monad governs Prolog, the StateT monad governs most imperative languages, some languages provide continuations built in).\r\n\r\nAs they are so foundational, and useful, [monads exist for many languages](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad#Monads_in_other_languages), , however the implementations are usually too awkward, due to lack of language support for bounded parametric polymorphism, and rebindable syntax --- most languages just have their evaluation strategies too deeply wired in.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808197,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cuaaf","parent_id":"t1_cu994","author_flair_text":null,"author":"dons","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19390-2ba6d1c4-cdf0-4fc4-8efd-9cc9fd1e7542-1566236764"}

Researchers in 1966 found that jury nullification occurred only 8.8 percent of the time between 1954 and 1958, and suggested that \"one reason why the jury exercises its very real power [to nullify] so sparingly is because it is officially told it has none.\" (California's charge to the jury in criminal cases is typical: \"It becomes my duty as judge to instruct you concerning the law applicable to this case, and it is your duty as jurors to follow the law as I shall state it to you ... You are to be governed solely by the evidence introduced in this trial and the law as stated to you by me.\") Today no officer of the court is allowed to tell the jury of their veto power.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166769162,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vq32","id":"cvq34","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"molasses","retrieved_on":1473809179,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45064-d947719a-b41b-4d2b-a84d-c8cb41c11cad-1566236774"}

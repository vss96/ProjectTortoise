It isn't a lie when it is a fictional character. Denying that he was a shill for Big Pharma is just priceless. Crichton didn't say he was a shill, he said a charcter in a fictional book was a shill.\r\n\r\nIt's clear that Crichton believes his stated opinions on global warming (by the way, I think global warming is happening, I am not defending Crichton's global warming views). I didn't read the original critique that apparently spawned this fictional charcter, but if that critique on Crichton called him an \"Exxon shill\" or something, that that would be just provocation in my mind turn it around and seemingly call him a shill right back to see how such defamation feels.\r\n\r\nNot everyone who disagrees with you has malintent and is a paid liar for corporate interests. In my opinion it damages the arguments of those who are right (or wrong) when they engage in ad hominem attacks.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_us8a","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808544,"author":"happyjuggler0","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cusko","id":"cust9","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28578-62944ef0-63eb-4585-b9cf-0cdc7d695d25-1566236768"}

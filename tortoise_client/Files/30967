We tracked Santa last year.  They had cute animation which showed him flying over international capitol cities.  Their \"scientific\" explanations are hilarious.  So much so, my son became very insistent that we ask Santa about the biscuits we set out.  So, we emailed Santa.  Then, we had to email Norad.  We wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Norad,\r\n\r\nMy name is *** ******.  The North Pole email is on auto-reply.  Do you have his cell phone number?  My Mom lost it.\r\n\r\nI've put out 8 lovely chocolate biscuits for him.  If he doesn't eat them all, I want to know if he would mind me having them.\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas,\r\n*****\r\n\r\nWithin 45 minutes Norad wrote my son:\r\n\r\n\"My Son's Name, Santa doesn't carry a cell phone when he is working.  He travels too fast for the signal to keep up. You'll have to try and leave a letter for him.   As for the chocolate biscuits, they sound yummy.  If there are extra, Santa will leave them for your Mom to decide if you can have them. \r\n \r\nSanta was last seen arriving in Debrecen, Hungary at 15:01 MST. Please visit our Web site at www.noradsanta.org. Thank you for emailing. All of us here at NORAD wish you a Merry Christmas! Sincerely,\r\nNORAD Santa Tracking Team\"\r\n\r\nThe only part I didn't like was that Santa needed US jet fighters to escort him safely into the U.S.  I mean - those terrorists may have paid off a reindeer or elf in a dasterdly plan to up Santa over America.  Santa didn't need a military escort through *any* other country.\r\n\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808470,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_uoqy","id":"cuotf","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"svaha","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26766-9ecee2ad-19c1-4388-a572-22bc4a4563e5-1566236768"}

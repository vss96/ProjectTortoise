I think that there are some important things that are missing from his analysis, however. First of all, a method of valuation is only useful if the inputs to the model can actually be collected. The more detailed the information that's required, the less likely it is that you will be able to collect that information from recent comparable sales. This means that unless we can get \"web 2.0\" companies to publish the information needed for a model, the model is useless. The second thing to keep in mind is that a company is only as useful to the purchaser as the revenue it can generate. Therefore, the valuation will necessarily depend on how the acquiring company intends to monetize the \"web 2.0\" company. If the intention is to put ads on the page that pay per view, perhaps page views is the most pertinent statistic.\r\nWhat's interesting about this article isn't that it is likely to lead to a better method of financial valuation, because it probably isn't. What's interesting is the analysis of the value of the website to a user. His model is indeed more accurate for how a user of the website is likely to feel about a website. This is because a user cares  about content, which is what his model is based on, whereas a purchaser cares only about money, which can be made with different amounts of content depending on many factors.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809599,"gilded":0,"id":"cwc7z","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wb5g","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56449-3cf37bec-266d-4514-aadb-e03e39a9ee4a-1566236779"}

Obviously the Old Testament God does not exist, as he is no longer appearing in public, saving his chosen people, or smiting pagans.  He's no longer angry at the lack of worshipping (sacrificing and burning of animals), and no longer directly causing plagues (unless you count global warming :P)\r\n\r\nThe nebulous New Testament God as interpreted by modern Christians is the one that can't be disproven, since He is so loosely defined.  He is invisible (no more burning bushes or pillars of fire), may or may not cause miracles, may or may not answer prayers, is worshipped entirely based on faith without evidence.  He is either Good but no longer all-powerful, or is all-powerful but defined by a different form of Goodness (after all, disasters still happen to \"good\" people).","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tivn","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165251018,"score":8,"ups":8,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6861-3697ac7d-cf5a-4b82-83b2-d6327922d438-1566236760"}

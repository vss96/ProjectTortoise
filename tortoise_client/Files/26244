I have taught beginning Python programming classes and have always liked starting off with [PythonWin](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018&amp;package_id=79063&amp;release_id=449591) (aka win32all);  up until 2.4.4 it was even listed on the official [Python download page](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.4/) as a recommended package for Windows users!  It's got a decent code editor (code highlighting, autocomplete, etc.), built in interpreter window, debugger, and looks and feels a little more native than IDLE (which is written in Tk).","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5763-d000cc4f-5b1c-4ed3-9ec9-f63d88800e1b-1566236759"}

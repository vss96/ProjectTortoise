Printer companies sell the printers at a loss and then make their money on the ink.\r\n\r\nThey probably still would, but Epson put all the old make-money-on-the-printer-and-sell-cheap-ink companies out of business, except the ones that adapted and copied Epson.\r\n\r\nSo really, blame human stupidity.  Customers prefer printers that cost $100 upfront but require that you pay $1200 for ink over the life of the printer.  We used to have printers that would cost $400 upfront and maybe $200-300 for ink over the life of the printer, but they lost out to the cheaper Epson and HP models.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808768,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv4gh","id":"cv4mk","author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34172-fb9b08d5-b71d-4320-8f1e-20b08c3c24d5-1566236771"}

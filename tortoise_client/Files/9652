Of course they would. In point of fact, the Russian government would be *incredibly happy* to fulfill such a simple requirement. It's a) easy to do and b) would not actually have any implications whatsoever for anyone.\r\n\r\nI mean, it's not like allofmp3 is the only site on the Internet. Remember all those Napsters and Kazaas being sued and \"shut down\"? And now you can't download mp3s anywhere! Oh, wait...\r\n\r\nMy point was that the entire situation is absolutely ridiculous and RIAA is stupid, stupid, and stupid. It's stupid beyond belief. It's a bunch of morons who don't get *anything*. Not a thing.\r\n\r\nThey do manipulate politics and diplomacy, yeah, but they don't seem to understand how little they change in Da Real World [TM], if anything. Even years after the whole iTunes thing happened (that did change the world quite a bit), RIAA still fails to understand how people tick and what customers really want.\r\n\r\nDear RIAA, I don't get my music from politicians and diplomats. (Or allofmp3, for that matter.) Go manipulate them all you want.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vtf3","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809278,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Schwallex","id":"cvva0","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvv7v","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47700-50914a06-875a-4deb-8f4a-5d1659bc8d3f-1566236775"}

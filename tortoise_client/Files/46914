Exactly how are you planning to get them all to upgrade?\"\r\n\r\nI don't find this convincing. If Windows customers were overly concerned with legality, then there wouldn't be any DRM issue in the first place. And Microsoft has much nastier ways to push a new OS, and a history of using them, too. It's never been about dangling a carrot.\r\n\r\n&gt;\"If you don't want to make them available, then I'm sure our customers will find sources of entertainment that take advantage of all the graphics power that the latest generation of PCs has to offer.\"\r\n\r\nMy point exactly. PCs do a lot more than play other people's movies and music. Even if PCs were incapable of doing so, millions of people would still want them, buy them, and use them. Microsoft could make Vista a success *without* catering to newfangled DRM-encumbered media formats.\r\n\r\n&gt;\"How would it affect Windows OS sales if, say, ATI were hit with a billion-dollar lawsuit for contributory infringement?\"\r\n\r\nMy guess is: not at all.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809447,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cvzmh","edited":false,"id":"cw48h","author":"Lagged2Death","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52317-fa63aeb6-cbed-46fa-bc2f-9bbcff669dd1-1566236778"}

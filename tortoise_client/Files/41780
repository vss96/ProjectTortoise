{"body":"This hardly strikes me \"police harrassment\" -- I mean does anyone here honestly think that if you are pulled over by a police officer, the best course of action is to argue, give them reason to think you have something to hide, and overall attempt to make their job tougher? I mean all the kid had to say was \"Oh just driving around to relax\" or some such nonsense, saying: \"Oh I dont want to tell you where I am going or what I will be doing\" to an enforcer of the law is *begging* for troubles. I think the kid *WANTED* a video of \"police harassment\" and ended up getting a rather calm supervisor who explained very well what was going on --- just some kid wanting attention if you ask me.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wgpl","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167527051,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"CarlH","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_wgpl","id":"cwi5y","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809710,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59401-020f0b00-cb21-4077-857b-fc41fe411b59-1566236780"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; Most people fail to recognize that the gold standard was abandoned at around the same time there were sufficient ICBM's in existence.\r\n\r\nThat's false, on several levels.  The first time we moved off the gold standard was in the 1930s, during the Depression.  There were no ICBMs then.  The second time was in 1971.  The [number of nuclear warheads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:US_nuclear_warheads_1945-2002_graph.png) peaked in the early 1960s.\r\n\r\n&gt; There is no need to nuke an entire country, if you can simply nuke Fort Knox and have the entire countries wealth literally vaporize.\r\n\r\nGold is not wealth any more than paper money is wealth.  If a foreign power had nuked Fort Knox, we'd simply go off the gold standard (as we did anyway), and life would proceed much as it had before.  The real wealth of a nation is in its capital stock - factories, infrastructure, educated workforce, accumulated knowledge, etc.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tkec","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165286787,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctmo3","id":"ctn59","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807765,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8115-c6b3bc14-c286-4d0c-b105-522fa132bc6a-1566236760"}

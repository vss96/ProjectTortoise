My point more or less is that capitalism can inadvertently create socialist conditions, i.e. unskilled workers who don't earn enough, or who are hired at part time as to make them ineligible for benefits become a larger \"socialist blight\" on society, as mr_wf put it, than simply getting employers to pay them enough money to cover basic costs of living.\r\n\r\nDid you notice the top story today, [\"If Exxon can give half a billion dollars to the CEO, I see no reason why taxpayers should have to fund their business\"](http://reddit.com/info/vrfp/comments)?  CEO's are making absurd amounts of money, while minimum wage workers are earning less, given for inflation etc etc, than they they have in the past fifty years.  It is the middle class that ends up largly paying for this difference as by providing social services.","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46574-c01be947-c0e7-4c58-b036-0a7c6869276e-1566236775"}

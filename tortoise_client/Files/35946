What do we pay the military for anyway?\"\r\n\r\nWorld War II required the help of all the people, and they only helped because they believed in the fight. Iraq didn't require any help, so Americans were okay with it as long as it didn't effect them.\r\n\r\nSome pretty hardcore immoral shit all-around, if you ask me.\r\n\r\nUnless something happens to rally people, a draft would go over much worse than Vietnam.

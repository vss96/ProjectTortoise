{"controversiality":0,"body":"The Chinese are pulling a sham on the world. They are ramping up their military, giving enormous tax breaks (and even building factories) for foreign companies, printing more dollars to make their goods cheaper, using severely underpaid and overworked labor and slave labor to make the products (killing or beating dissenters), playing \"Don't you like us now?\" diplomacy shell games, and using Japanese firms to purchase USA manufacturing equipment from factories that are shut down so that we won't be able to reuse the existing equipment again.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling they're going to invade Taiwan and North Korea soon and the USA will just have to stand back and watch them. What is the USA military going to do? Put in thousands of orders for military parts from Chinese factories to go to war? Throw plastic parts from Wal*Mart at them? Doubt it.\r\n\r\nAnd the odd thing is that North Korea is an easy country to topple when you look at it from an electricity standpoint. Take out 3 electric power plants and you own the country. That is, you own it until the Chinese kick you out to take it over.\r\n\r\nAnd the Republicans aren't doing a darn thing about it.\r\n\r\n-Signed, Conservative Republican in the USA.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ubdm","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-16,"ups":-16,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165763225,"author":"supermike","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_ubdm","edited":false,"id":"cubvg","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808226,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20181-032d2df2-084e-4979-ad5f-5044d53b82f6-1566236765"}

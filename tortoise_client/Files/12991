Luck is taken out of the equation, and you're left with skill and opponent modeling.\r\n\r\nBesides, it's actually very hard to beat a fixed-limit bot heads-up. You can learn a lot and it definitely is interesting. Not entirely different than playing against a human online opponent.","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37156-7cba67e1-c38b-4649-8a4e-35d4bc09fa48-1566236772"}

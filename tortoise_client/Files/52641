I was appalled at all the hoops that I had to jump through to get a simple J2EE application working, most of which seemed to exist solely to work around the limits set by Java's type system.\r\n\r\nI eventually found someone willing to hire me *even though* I didn't have three years of experience with WebLogic, and let's just say that nothing I saw on the job convinced me to upgrade my opinion of J2EE.  There was that one project where I had to implement something with portlets...the horror! the horror!\r\n\r\nSteele, Gosling, &amp; co. are smart people, and I am sure that if Sun's head honchos had handed them a clean sheet of paper and said \"please give us an object-oriented language with C-like syntax that's good for serving dynamic Web pages and interacting with databases\", they would have kicked ass.  But by the time Sun realized that that there was big money in server-side applications (rather than set-top boxes, cross-platform GUI applications, or browser-side applets), they had already sunk gazillions of dollars into marketing Java, and sinking gazillions more into marketing a completely new language would have just been embarrassing.  So instead they spent demi-gazillions convincing the PHBs that J2EE was The Next Big Thing, and the peons coding in the trenches had to suck it up and deal.","link_id":"t3_utqb","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166189850,"score":9,"ups":9,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30338-96e143bf-1b57-4c9a-8013-46f420472dd4-1566236769"}

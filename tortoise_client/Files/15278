Why not admit that it is more complex than CO2 emissions and no one knows if anything is going on.\r\n\r\nThere are scientists out there who will tell you that it is pretty hard to predict non-linear chaotic systems.  There is an assumption being made that CO2 levels have a direct correlation to global average temperature, which no one really knows.  I know, there are simulations that are saying the earth is warming and is going to continue to keep warming, but those simulations are operating with a finite amount of information and make many assumptions.  \r\n\r\nThe sad thing, for me at least, is the people who are building a lot of the software that the climate scientists are basing their predictions on have CS backgrounds and should know better.  A CS degree is basically a math degree with programming classes thrown in.  I don't blame a \"climate scientist\" or a politician, or anyone.  The math is complex and it is much easier for a univ to get funding by making the issue more about politics and less about science.","retrieved_on":1473809123,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvn7m","parent_id":"t1_cvn38","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mrcsparker","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43503-7c12fe25-285c-4fad-b311-3f49cfeb7fd0-1566236774"}

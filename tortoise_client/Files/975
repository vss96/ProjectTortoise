I have to admit that I still don't really understand why Maybe is a monad, despite the explanations of it that I've read. I think that maybe I do understand and just can't explain it; indeed, it took me about three months to be able to write monadic code that did what I expected it to, but about six years to get to the point where I could have half a chance at answering the question, \"what the hell are monads, and why should I care?\" from a programmer who doesn't know Haskell.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165934422,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24791-5f4e3718-2543-40af-b169-493527a6cba1-1566236767"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"FTA \"The study emphasized that economic growth is, by itself, no fix: How the gains are distributed is just as important.\"  This just goes to show we cannot just throw money at the problem and hope it will go away.\r\nI'm glad to see an article emphasizing how the poverty situation isn't really getting any better in these poor countries; but poverty isn't just an issue in these third world countries.  In no way am I trying to demean the situation in other countries, but I know that in the US the poverty isn't even spoken of.\r\nThis is a huge problem in the world that most people don't even consider looking at.  The isolation we have in the US seperates the socio-economic in such a (clever) way to never really allow people to see the conditions of other groups.  I just hope that news like this coming from large news sources will encourage people to take action.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u42x","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165642818,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"takamori","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu7ir","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u42x","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808146,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17944-97db8eb7-dfe8-44dd-b8f4-1e258b33d96c-1566236763"}

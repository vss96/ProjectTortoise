{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; I'm not sure I agree with you about the satellite at the end of the tether. First off, do we need a satellite at the end?\r\n\r\nThats the concept they're proposing that a geostationary satellite would essentially drop a rope down to earth and let someone climb up it. Of course its not that simple, but thats the principle behind it.\r\n\r\n&gt; I don't believe there's as much risk of positive feedback with the space elevator as there is with a building or a bridge\r\n\r\nActually after reading more up on the idea, there is a lot of possible \"positive feedback\" results. If you think of it as a flexible jump rope, you can imagine a lot of oscillations that are possible. I suppose it would have to be rigid to avoid these oscillations and I was wrong that buildings swayed because of a need to resist wind (it is to resist earthquakes I learned). Still a rigid structure seems a bit less plausable to me, because then its not really relying upon a geosynchronous orbit (as much) to stay aloft, but rather a giant pole sticking up in space now.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, it might someday be plausable, but the depiction in the video seems highly unrealistic to me. Apparantly my views though are in the minority though.","link_id":"t3_vz0r","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167175653,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"aletoledo","edited":false,"id":"cw3kc","parent_id":"t1_cw2zf","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809434,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51902-cd62c4f3-023f-491a-a940-57c08eb62427-1566236778"}

We do not use an additional program to allow this to happen. We work as a virtural ad agency. We all spend 2-4 days in the office then work from remote locations. We all use suitcase fusion but managing a current font list is hard and takes up a lot of space. We often have a mismatched set because people start using fonts that are not central to the office fonts. \r\nWe have to collect fonts and images for every project so we have the correct font family the file calls for. It sucks up at least 15 min. on every project for me. (project manager) and if someone did not collect the fonts, I may be forced to replace with a font family that is of differernt origin. (same font, different creator)\r\nWish there was a solution that Extensis could provide for us that does not require us to sell the farm to adopt. \r\n","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166741596,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44469-eb191b94-218b-44ca-b415-42168fa5e5ee-1566236774"}

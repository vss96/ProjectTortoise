The application runs on a Linux box with SBCL, MySQL and the UCW and CLSQL frameworks. We only have two programmers working on the project, and while I had used PHP in the past, we knew that whatever we used would be pretty new for both of us. While Rails, PHP, Django, et al. have more mature web development environments, it was the language that eventually decided it for us. We have been very happy with our choice, and have found a great community of very smart and helpful lisp users that hang out on #lisp and #ucw.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51229-9d3653db-5051-4152-9127-b01bb7699f1e-1566236778"}

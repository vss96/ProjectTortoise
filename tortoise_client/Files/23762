He simply called him a name.  The preacher verbally attacked him first and was trying to start an argument.  Sucks to be him because he IS a motherfucker.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, the professor refused to debate the preacher.   True, he took the briefcase, but nothing prevented the preacher from walking over to the prof and taking it back.  He didn't even ask for it back.  It's not like the professor grabbed it and ran.\r\n\r\nIt seems more likely that the professor was hoping to get the preacher to follow him, and he'd have given it back to him as soon as the guy moved off campus.\r\n\r\nHe could have driven the guy nuts that way.  Moving it off campus every time the preacher put it down and tried to start something.","controversiality":0,"score":22,"ups":22,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165630823,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17669-d4dcb43d-ed52-4d8f-8e65-4cfa40328ef0-1566236763"}

I am a strong supporter of the Constitution but I recognize it is only a piece of paper - a public statement of what our ideal world is like.  No piece of paper ever accomplished anything; it takes real people with real power to uphold the ideals enumerated on that paper to make the world a good place to live.\r\n\r\nIt is up to each of us to actively defend our ideals.  Our ability to do so depends on power.  If the courts are crooked and routinely railroad people (like an all-white jury convicting an innocent black man in the 1960s) then the victims are powerless and will suffer despite the fact they allegedly have rights.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to exert one's power and you enumerated a few.  It would be passive to simply complain to your friends that your rights were violated but it would an act of power to hire a lawyer and do something about it.\r\n\r\nEd Howdershelt put it well when he said \"There are four boxes to be used in defense of liberty: soap, ballot, jury, and ammo. Please use in that order.\"\r\n\r\nI am not just making up an argument over a minor point.

I suggest this be called the \"stop line.\"\r\n\r\nMy stop line for this silly rant was this one:\r\n\r\n&gt; In 1936, Churchill told a British general, 'Germany is getting too strong; we must smash her.' That was his only objection to the Nazis.\r\n\r\nChurchill may or may not have actually said that. I note parenthetically that the exact phrasing and punctuation for this version of the reported remark apparently comes only from an essay by Harry Barnes, one of the grandfathers of American Holocaust-denial. The essay can be read on various Holocaust-denier sites, like [this denier site](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v01/v01p163_Barnes.html) or [this denier site](http://www.vho.org/GB/Journals/JHR/1/2/Barnes163-168.html). And the idea that this was Churchill's only objection to Nazis? That's why I stopped.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808759,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_v1el","edited":false,"id":"cv47k","author":"jamiemccarthy","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33944-c7342643-ac8f-4bb3-84d2-7ddbef7f9d1a-1566236771"}

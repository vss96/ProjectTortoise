{"body":"Sure it is. You're just rationalizing. Let's walk through this: \r\n\r\n1) You want the song. If you didn't you would not copy it. The song thus has some value to you. \r\n\r\n2) You're getting that value by making a copy of the song.\r\n \r\n3) You're not compensating the owner of the song for the value you receive by copying the song. \r\n\r\nThat's theft. This fact that the copy does not deprive the owner of property isn't really important.  \r\n\r\nIf you don't value the song enough to pay for it and could not copy it, you simply would not have the song... In other words, if you could not copy it, you'd be forced to choose to either compensate the song owner or do without. Easy, high fidelity copying lets people get around this conundrum.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vtf3","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166901855,"author":"corwin","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvv52","parent_id":"t1_cvuhp","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809275,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47630-b55bae90-c1a6-4945-a1be-ab1c54b8f607-1566236775"}

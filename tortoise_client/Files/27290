If he's been charged with two felonies, why was he allowed to stay in school all day?\r\n\r\nWhy was the SWAT team sent to his house?  SWAT teams seem very unlikely for this crime.\r\n\r\nHe's charged with two felonies but his mom was still allowed to text message him while the cops were there?\r\n\r\nHe should have already had a hearing on this matter, why hasn't he written about what happened in court?\r\n\r\nThe school magically knew the page was updated but it took two months for them to figure out who did it?  It's more likely that someone saw it and inquired about it.\r\n\r\nNo mention of this anywhere in the news.\r\n\r\nNo police report.\r\n\r\nThis kid just created this blog and it's his only post.  He also created a new account on digg just to post this story.\r\n\r\nI want more proof before I give my sympathy away to this kid.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vprk","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166792478,"ups":10,"score":10,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45255-0afd672f-bf3d-4eb4-a407-c572a1ad0330-1566236774"}

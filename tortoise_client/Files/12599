Once working the 3rd shift at a post office plant and the other while being the only white person working at a black owned and operated company. In both cases, when I didn't respond or get angry at being called \"college-boy\"(like there's something wrong with higher education), the insults and contempt began to mount. Whenever I'd try to \"turn the other cheek\" they'd come at me harder, trying to get me to lose my cool.

{"body":"The best parts of Firefly were story driven.  And the most tedious parts were the filler episodes.  Remember the episode with the ignorant scared villagers which went nowhere?  Remember the interspatial cattle rustling?  I wish I didn't either.\r\n\r\nBut this is the sort of thing which the game is going to be about.  There is very little story for an MMO player, they have to make their own within the confines of the game world the developers provide -- whether that world was made well or not.\r\n\r\nIf I didn't have a conflict of interest I would suggest that everyone who reads that article should just click on the EVE Online link and continue reading there :-)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u1x9","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165587801,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rmtew","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u1x9","id":"cu44g","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808080,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15966-4e0e855a-4c0e-4a57-a433-7fc913957234-1566236763"}

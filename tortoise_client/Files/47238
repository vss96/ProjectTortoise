I know not everyone here is against the Decider, but FWIW, it seems like something people here would find worth a click-look. The guy who makes these shirts is a friend of mine and I'm helping him out. I don't make any money from sales of these shirts. They are hand-printed and this isn't an affiliate program. He's currently fighting off a spurious lawsuit filed by a large food conglomerate over his locally famous \"Eat More Kale\" slogan. Buying shirts helps him afford to fight this (until Disney sues him for this one, anyway).","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5586-7d7f0951-7348-4778-aee3-e83681b4b859-1566236759"}

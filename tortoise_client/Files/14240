In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses. When those far removed from the creation of wealth-- undergraduates, reporters, politicians-- hear that the richest 5% of the people have half the total wealth, they tend to think injustice! An experienced programmer would be more likely to think is that all? The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software.*\r\n\r\nWealth is created folks, and the path to helping the poor is figuring out how to help them create wealth, not taking someone else's wealth and giving it to them.\r\n\r\nIf you give a man a handout, pretty soon he needs another handout. Give him the means to create enough wealth to live on, then you have in effect created a perpetual motion machine.\r\n\r\nThe reason the bulk of the world's poor are poor is not because the wealth creators in \"the North\" aren't giving their wealth to the world's poorest, indeed the richest countries have given over a trillion dollars in aid over the past few decades to the poorest countries. The reason the world's poorest countries are poor is that they are structured in such a way as to make it very hard to create new wealth, and relatively easy for those with connections to either steal other people's wealth outright, or to have a virtual monopoly granted by the state on the most obvious wealth creating methods. \r\n\r\nGiving aid to a kleptocracy won't do diddly to help the world's poorest, which helps explain why our $1,000,000,000,000+ in aid has done nothing to help the world's poor.\r\n\r\nChina has been booming since 1978 because they restructured the country to enable individual wealth creation, and as a result they've taken hundreds of millions of their own citizens out of (third world definition) poverty, and the bottom in China (as well as the middle and top, not so incedentally) keeps getting more prosperous.\r\n\r\nNot just China, but South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore. Ireland, Estonia, to name just a few of the more prominent examples, have turned around their own country's fortunes, and that of its poorest citizens, via enabling wealth creation of the oh-so-hated wealth that leads the wealth-is-evil crowd to moan about inequality.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9494-9d9cc741-0a8a-4dbe-88c0-14c495f159b5-1566236761"}

{"body":"Being ok with teens showing their sexual nature doesn't make someone a pedofile.\r\n\r\nBeing a pedofile means being attracted to prepubescent children, rather than being comfortable with post-pubescent teens dancing.  It's not even a matter of being attracted to post-pubescent teens, but just not being disturbed by the sight.\r\n\r\nTrying to force hormoned teenagers not to think about sex, while it's surrounding them, simply makes them rebel against it and embrace it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be disturbed by pedophile types of behavior, go watch a pre-teen beauty pageant.  It's very disturbing to see a 6 year old with makeup and dressed to look sexy by their parents.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wdrb","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":32,"ups":32,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167425108,"author":"nosoupforyou","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cwe47","edited":false,"id":"cwe6o","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809636,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57463-e54a857e-cea5-49e9-ab16-acaad18d336e-1566236779"}

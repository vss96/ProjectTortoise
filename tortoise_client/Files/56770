Preach on brother, preach on.  Oh it's costing you 5% in taxes,....boo f**king hoo!\r\n\r\nI dare you to ask a black person how much it costs him to lose his history, to not know what his name is, to not know his genealogy, to not know his languages, to live in a country where the media is filled with images of him shucking and jiving, where his homeland is still in ravages due to the whims of colonizers, where all of the riches of his lands are still being systematically stolen, where the social systems that had sustained them and allowed them to live in harmony with the land for thousands of years have been laid to waist by the western world and their preoccupation with \"progress\".\r\n\r\n\"Begin at the beginning, go on until you reach the end and then stop..\" you lazy motherf**ker, you start reading the book at the last chapter and think that you have any idea as to what the story is about.  Or worse you pick and chose the parts that you like that support who you are.  You are the worst type of fool, the dishonest fool.  Though you might be forgiven for your dishonesty you cannot be healed of it, you are doomed to repeat your lies to yourself. I pray that they give you comfort.\r\n","link_id":"t3_v38q","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166374904,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34028-1772540d-761c-4f8d-bf84-f4a607264967-1566236771"}

They're in a tough spot, the industry (RIAA, MPAA) are the ones responsible for pressuring MS to adopt these sorts of things.\r\n\r\nMS is a huge, rich, and powerful company that always seems strangely unwilling to use its considerable influence for anything really significant. Unless it's punishing its own resellers for also selling Linux, say.\r\n\r\nSo I don't have a lot of sympathy for the \"tough spot\" point-of-view. If the PC has become an important platform for the entertainment market -- and it has -- *that gives Microsoft all the power* in the relationship. Windows simply isn't going anywhere; if the content industry wants access to millions of incredibly powerful new-media machines (PCs), they have to work with Microsoft. They have to work with Windows. The MPAA/RIAA need the PC biz; the PC biz doesn't need the MPAA/RIAA *at all*.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't really any reason MS couldn't have told the content industry to just cram it. \"You want our help making HD-DVD a hit? Sorry, we don't do this crazy-impossible DRM stuff you talking about. We're not going to undermine the world's most popular computing platform to help you stroke your outsized egos. *I guess HD-DVD just won't be playing on Windows or the Xbox* -- too bad, you'll have to go it alone. Good freakin' luck.\"\r\n\r\nBut watching from the outside, at least, Microsoft never seems to take a stand like that. They kowtow to the insane-o-crats instead.","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46705-e86e194e-eab0-45b0-ad7d-19804226d0ea-1566236775"}

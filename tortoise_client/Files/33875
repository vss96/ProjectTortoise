{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; \"for a change\"? You're suggesting \"attack the man\" on a regular basis?\r\n\r\nSay what?  The \"for a change\" bit implies that you should *not* attack the man.  You must have missed the reading comprehension day in high school.\r\n\r\n&gt; don't believe I made any attack on the man here either.\r\n\r\nYou said \"Author is basically saying he doesn't like PHP because it's not Python.\"  That's an attack on the man by ascribing motivations to him for which you have no credible evidence.\r\n\r\n&gt; PHP has lots of things wrong with it and this article adds little but it's far more interesting to explore what PHP gets right and embrace those features.\r\n\r\nYeah, 'cause it's completely useless to identify its problems and try to improve upon them.  No, wait, that's not right.\r\n\r\n&gt; The puzzle is why is PHP so popular - do we really believe it's because of mass stupidity / blindness or does something actually work well?\r\n\r\nWho said \"it's because of mass stupidity / blindness\"?  Why are you creating this false dilemma?  Why can't it be some third option?","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uvma","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166298592,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"apotheon","parent_id":"t1_cv0fb","id":"cv1ps","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808712,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32696-247e8f56-20c0-44f9-96ed-3a859b2063b2-1566236770"}

People care more about the team and the game then about a kid who almost gets his leg blown off.  The ironic part is that this kid was one of them, part of the tradition at the school.  Then when things go badly the community as a whole turns their back on him and treats him like a leper because this accident threatens one of their traditions.  If you don't feel there is something wrong with that you should get your head checked.  People have their priorities mixed up when they value their football traditions higher then the well being of one of their own.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vjjc","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":26,"ups":26,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166711857,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43176-19f7ca30-c72b-4310-9434-0d985258de89-1566236774"}

Talking to the landlord is a waste of time, at least the one here.  They're a corporate landlord.  Heat is included in the rent since there's only a common heating system.  They don't care about heating costs since they can pass it on in the rent.  They haven't even bothered to put in maximum temperature settings on the thermostat controls.  I have the heat turned off and it stays about 75 degrees since my neighbors have their heat set at 90 or something.  I even had to run the AC a few days ago when it went over 80 in my apt.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_td6l","stickied":false,"subreddit":"science","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165164582,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5065-20f3af2a-253d-4bba-97f2-6a3e46ca46e2-1566236759"}

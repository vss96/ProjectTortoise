You want every outsourced job to be that of rocket scientists??\r\n\r\nIf you RTFA, you will realize (one of) the problem facing India is that there are ***not enough*** \"dumb-jobs\" outsourced or generated by local industry to support its massive uneducated and unskilled labor. (Relative) Absence of an \"industrial revolution\" (consisting mostly of \"dumb-jobs\") in India is the most stark difference between it and developed countries (and China).\r\n\r\nThe outsourced jobs (as far as I know) pay an order of magnitude more than corresponding jobs in other industries in India (available at that level educational qualification). (ie compare the salary of an programmer (Bachelor in CS/CE) to that of an engineer working any other field (Bachelor in Mech/Environ etc)) \r\n\r\nThe wages might be low according to the developed world standard of living, but by India's standard they are ***very high*** and are getting higher.. (Wages are always set by the local market and not by any International standards. It is a 'Supply and Demand' curve)\r\n\r\nAnd for Indians in tech jobs it is a considerable success to be 22-23 years of age and be completely debt free (no student loans) and with a job that pays 2-3 times more than expected expenditure.\r\n\r\nAnd I take offense in you calling a race (a population) \"slaves\"; Those people do a job on their own free will and get paid for it.. Fucking yuppies like you don't know what \"slavery\" is! \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w83o","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809560,"author":"rocky_m","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwa4b","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw9sz","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55395-b741082f-9b2d-4374-8a0e-eaee9c38c02b-1566236779"}

{"body":"If you guys like this kind of stuff,  you would enjoy a visit to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View (CA) -- http://www.computerhistory.org/ -- I don't remember if it is the same model,  but there is one of these very large early hard drives,  plus a lot of other goodies,  with guided tours given by very enthusiastic and knowledgeable docents.  Well worth the visit.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u9e3","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165713593,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cua9e","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u9e3","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808197,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19374-dcede95b-7609-4939-bbc8-227a8639fa69-1566236764"}

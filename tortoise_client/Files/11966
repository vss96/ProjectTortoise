Add to which, gold has higher transaction costs, it has to be assayed on exchange (or exchanged in a certified form which is difficult to counterfeit; eg. coins) and it falls prey to all of the disadvantages of physical value tokens. \r\n\r\nAnd various \"gold backed digital currencies\" ([e-gold](http://www.e-gold.com),[e-bullion](http://e-bullion.com/),[Goldmoney](http://www.goldmoney.com/en/how-to-buy.html),etc.) are basically [Paypal](http://paypal.com), in gold-colored fancy dress.

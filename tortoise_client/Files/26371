The thing is, it's hard to know how an allele causes some phenotype, even if it's widespread.  For example, we know that mutations in FOXP2 cause problems with language, but we will still don't know what FOXP2 actually has to do with language.  We know that mutations in microcephalin cause small brains, but it doesn't seem to affect intelligence much.  I'm writing a paper on the genetics of autism right now, and that's probably why I'm so pessimistic on this subject at the moment.  There have been so many regions identified as causing autism in some individuals, but having a mutation in one of those reasons doesn't mean you'll have autism, and you can have autism without having mutations in any of those regions.  There has been so much work on the subject, but it's such an ill-defined and complex trait (much like many cognitive traits) that we can't really figure out what causes it.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ucsv","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25062-817ff5c0-9dcb-44a6-a891-0e58c7b6e5f8-1566236767"}

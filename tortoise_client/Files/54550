Whenever there are situations far from equilibrium you can get complex structures or patterns competing, and some getting selected.  This could be patterns of chemical reactions, patterns of vortices in turbulent flow for example, crystal structures and so on.  The difference from life is that such selected patterns aren't passed on.\r\n\r\nMy point is that there are many well-established mechanisms for driving non-random selection, and they don't need to involve intelligence.","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49029-22021258-7d8f-4054-b917-05202bd4737e-1566236777"}

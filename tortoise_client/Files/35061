Didn't it happen before?I thought I read somewhere that libertarianism used to be called Liberalism 100 years ago before the party changed into a socialist leaning party.\r\n\r\nI hope I'm wrong anyway.  Unfortunately, even if libertarianism becomes powerful enough to replace one of the two major parties, nothing prevents the party from being subsumed.  We'll still have the problem of a 2 party system knocking everyone else out of the water.\r\n\r\nThe best we can probably hope to do is reduce federal government and taxes back to a reasonable level (and by reasonable I mean current libertarian goals), and try to implement ways to prevent major parties from interfering with other parties.\r\n\r\nI still like the idea of just making all elections lotteries, with everyone in the selection rather than just those who want to run.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166663228,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvkja","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvju2","author":"nosoupforyou","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809073,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42263-e8217e29-a58d-4a95-b2d0-b17daff18c7f-1566236774"}

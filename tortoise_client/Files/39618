To begin with, how does one provide absolute proof that the \"evidence\" provided by the public 'witness' is in fact real, or unbiased, or otherwise credible?  Hardly an image goes by on the Internet these days without **some** idiot somewhere thoughtlessly screaming: \"Photoshopped!!\"... so; would the validity of the evided \"proof\" go unchallenged in a Court proceeding?  Especially when it is the 'Authorities' *themselves* being placed in the position of defense?\r\n\r\nI think any real degree of success with such an adversarial approach would be unlikely.  More likely to occur, in my opinion, may be some form of backlash against the citizens that would dare attempt such prosecution.  This is why I believe a different approach to the problem may be required.\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166390898,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cv527","id":"cv54j","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808777,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34466-66fbfa6a-d9be-4269-af09-dd461c63d1ff-1566236771"}

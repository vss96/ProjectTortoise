Every little bit of creativity, every joke, every clever thought, ends up on the page because _it has to_.  These guys draw themselves dry.  And then they have to come up with more.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the unrelenting pace sharpens and focuses their abilities like nothing else.  It's like a daily exercise of talent in front of many thousands of readers.  That's a lot of pressure, but it's also a lot of motivation.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty amazing to find creative people with that kind of work ethic -- that's a pretty interesting combination.  I remember happening upon a bookshop event with Kevin Fagan, the artist behind _Drabble_.  To be honest, I always thought his strip is consistently-just-kinda-funny.  Still do.  But he was a very likable guy who tossed around a lot of ideas and seemed to really have a heart for his characters.  I thought, gee, his strip should be better!  But I think I just didn't appreciate how difficult his job is.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tzs7","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165529630,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14717-c707135d-592f-48f2-96a3-6906a25f4e1b-1566236762"}

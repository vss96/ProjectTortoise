{"body":"I wonder what you were inferring by saying that they don't attack Bush.  Or what reason we should suppose you think that they attack everyone _but_ Bush.  No doubt because of a reverance for the office? Because that makes TONS of sense in this context.  Nevermind that you were disagreeing with someone who said they attack everyone and are most certainly not conservative. \"Is it true they haven't attacked bush?\" And your point was???\r\n\r\nYou either get the Moore/Rumsfeld connection or you don't.  In your case, nothing anyone can say will change that. If we are to believe you, your only reason for responding here was to say you think they are \"ugly\".  I think they are ridiculously funny and pretty damn sharp.  We disagree.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tpok","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":3,"score":3,"created_utc":1165372811,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"treagan","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cts36","id":"cts74","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807859,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10545-ce7fabbd-0e30-4897-94c8-4e2d11dd5b90-1566236761"}

Wanting to learn new developments implies at least some dissatisfaction with the status quo; otherwise, why bother reading when you could be hacking all day long!

My day job is all Java, and I suspect that there are many others here that also work with it.\r\n\r\nSo there you are - a demographic reason why people hate Java.  Chances are, most of us also hate Cobol, and RPG, and PL/1, and many other programming mistakes over the years.  However, we aren't forced to use Cobol, and RPG, and PL/1 in our daily lives.  So you don't see the same vitriol directed towards them that you do towards Java.\r\n\r\nBjarne Stroustrop's quote is applicable here.  \"There are two kinds of programming languages: ones that nobody likes and ones that nobody uses.\"","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808568,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cutqd","edited":false,"id":"cuu2f","author_flair_text":null,"author":"nostrademons","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29261-1267c5e6-f53c-4a7c-a418-3b7f1448d278-1566236769"}

I meant $1.50.  I often find 4/6/12 packs of CFLs at between $1.20-1.60/ea.  Home Depot usually has a 6 pack of 13W spirals in a couple color temps for $8.\r\n\r\nI was probably over agressive to ask for $5/bulb to reach parity, it's more like $15 if the bulb has the characteristics described in the article.\r\n\r\nLet's say I can buy a 13W CFL for $1.50. If a bulb has a service life of 10K hours and electricity is 10c/KWHr, a 13W bulb uses 10K Hrs * 13W = 130 KWHr in its life so life time cost is $14.50.  Three of them to match a single LED service span costs $43.50.\r\n\r\nA 10W LED replacing these bulbs with a service life of 30K hours uses $30 in electricity, so reaches parity with the CFLs when its cost drops to $13.50.\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166173439,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30025-da643d2c-c843-4859-aa03-68fd8f17cadc-1566236769"}

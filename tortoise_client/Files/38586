Laws and experiments are inappropriate techniques for the explication of such events and processes. ~ Ernst Mayr\r\n\r\nWe must ask first whether the theory of evolution by natural selection is scientific or pseudoscientific .... Taking the first part of the theory, that evolution has occurred, it says that the history of life is a single process of species-splitting and progression. This process must be unique and unrepeatable, like the history of England. This part of the theory is therefore a historical theory, about unique events, and unique events are, by definition, not part of science, for they are unrepeatable and so not subject to test. ~ Colin Patterson \r\n\r\nThe domain of origin science was taken over by operation science. Even the unique, unrepeated events of the origin of the universe, of life, and of new life forms were treated as though the were observed regularities in the present. The difference between unobserved past singularities (origin science) was obscured. The search for natural (secondary) caused for how the universe and life operate in the present was gradually extended to how they originated in the past. Overlooked was the fact that events of origin are not a recurring pattern of events against which a theory of origin can be tested. ~ Norman Geisler  \r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807679,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctig2","edited":false,"id":"ctiju","author_flair_text":null,"author":"bevets","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6007-fea4d693-ca1f-45ae-893a-6479feb94544-1566236760"}

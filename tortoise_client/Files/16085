What sci-fi book have you been reading?\r\n\r\nIn QM the universe is represented as a normalised vector on a (usually infinite dimensional) complex [hilbert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space#Definition) space.  Note that the base field is the complex numbers, and the complex numbers form a continuum.  A hilbert space contains all its own limit points - again it is 'infinite'.\r\n\r\nIn [QFT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) the universe is, again, represented as a normalised vector on a (definitely infinite dimensional) complex hilbert space.  The hilbert space in this case is the [fock space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fock_space) generated by the set of solutions of a certain partial differential equation (note it's differen*tial* not differen*ce* - there's a continuum) on ... yes, you guessed it ... the 4 dimensional manifold known as spacetime.\r\n\r\nEverywhere you look there are continuums.\r\n\r\nYou have proved beyond reasonable doubt that you don't actually know any real physics, so I advise you buy yourself a [college textbook](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Quantum-Theory-Fields-Foundations-v/dp/0521670535/sr=8-5/qid=1166699084/ref=sr_1_5/202-0647705-2769451?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books) on the subject and read it before talking shit again.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166700211,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvloe","id":"cvm1u","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"acrophobia","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809102,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42981-51df118d-1f82-4f81-af57-f0b7c23e2bab-1566236774"}

Basically, if `limit f=0` and `limit g=0` then `limit f/g=limit (deriv f)/(deriv g)`. As the examples show, `(sin x)/x` and `(e^x - 1 - x)/x^2` have limits of 1 and 1/2 respectively, even though they both yield 0/0 when x=0. So the real value of 0/0 depends upon  how you got there, which is why 0/0 by itself has to be undefined.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808043,"gilded":0,"id":"cu22y","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tzna","author_flair_text":null,"author":"dustmop","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14997-d884c6a2-f7d5-49ac-a324-190bb5612a1f-1566236762"}

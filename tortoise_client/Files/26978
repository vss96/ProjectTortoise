{"body":"It's huge and mostly empty. In terms of population and real producing power, it's not much better than Germany or France.\r\n\r\nHe almost took the populated part. Really it was about Leningrad, which I think he took, Stalingrad, where he narrowly failed, and Moscow, which would have been somewhat defenseless if Stalingrad had fallen... not that they're geographically close, just that, once Hitler chose to attack Stalingrad, Stalin sent everything he had there as well. Both men poured well over a million soldiers into the city, if I remember correctly, making it THE big showdown of the eastern front if not the war.\r\n\r\nEdit: Huh. Leningrad was under seige for three years, but was not properly captured.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: Off topic, but I'd just like to point out that the battle of Stalingrad was as bad as seven hundred September 11s. How's that for some perspective?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v1el","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166343637,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cv3ce","parent_id":"t1_cv33r","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808744,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33574-004a257e-aa55-426b-a2cb-99983400331e-1566236770"}

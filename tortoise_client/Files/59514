Its not that its IMPLAUSABLE, its just very unlikely..\r\n\r\nIt may be unlikely, but that part is totally true. See the Wikipedia article on the [Washington Times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Times) and its supporting links.\r\n\r\nThe only question, really, is if Moon has invested $2bln or $3bln in the paper. It's simply a matter of fact that the paper was started and published by Moon.\r\n\r\nAs one data point to the trouble the WashTimes has had with getting enough readership, at many Metro stations the Times is given out for free. Right next to the always intended to be free Express (done by the Post) and the Washington Examiner (owned by a national company that does free local papers across the US). And yet, in many other places, they're still trying to get 25 cents for the Times. (I've also heard of buildings at places like 7-11 where you get the WashTimes free with the WSJ (or a free WSJ for the price of a Times.))","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wd9i","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809662,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"skynxnex","id":"cwfkl","parent_id":"t1_cwfeo","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58231-d6f4d361-ae29-40a5-99d5-46574562a0b7-1566236780"}

Before I start, I'll say that I _really do_ like the look of Python code. It's clean and pretty and I can't fault someone who places great importance on clean and pretty for using Python.\r\n\r\nThat said, the thing that drives me batty with Python is lambda and it has _everything_ to do with whitespace. Python's lambda only takes expressions and that's because writing a parser for a real lambda would be _damn hard_. It's not impossible to make such a parser work, it's just probably impossible to make it clean enough to [make Guido happy](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=147358).\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's not crippling because lots of good uses of lambda can be accomplished using other language features.\r\n\r\nBut, it's too bad, because while the opening and closing brackets might be \"ugly\", they're damn useful.","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165896113,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24008-549bdcae-f819-4933-9620-a253f42bd991-1566236767"}

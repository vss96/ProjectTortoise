Fixx had two heart attacks within a year, the second of which almost killed him.  He took up running after the second heart attack in an effort to stave off a third.  It was around 12 years later that the third one hit -- killing him.  Also this was back in the 1970's and 1980's when many of the medical procedures used today in heart treatment just didn't exist.  That particular death doesn't belong anywhere this list.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vkko","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43049-660780c0-7cdf-4d14-a463-f2a7a936a5ab-1566236774"}

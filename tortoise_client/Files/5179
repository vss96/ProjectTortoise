Typing them out without caps lock is a *bitch*.  Also, many types / sections of types of legal documents are typed in all caps, and bold / italics / underline is not an acceptable alternative.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Also, re: his complaints about variation in enter key and backspace key size, I prefer the reduced enter in exchange for larger backspace. It's annoying as hell when you're typing along on somebody else's keyboard and make a little error, and instead hitting backspace three times you hit \\\\ instead.  Blah.\r\n\r\nI do have to say, though: F-Lock should be banned, and it's creator tarred and feathered.  *I don't use Outlook, Word, or anything else* that the 'new' F-row affects.  I *do* use F5, Alt-F4, F-11, and actually in certain games, -all- the F keys.

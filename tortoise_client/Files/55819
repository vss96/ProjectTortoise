Try it yourself with this command:\r\n\r\n    jpegtran -copy all -progressive ssc2006-02a.jpg\r\n\r\nNote: jpegtran is a tool that doesn't change the compressed data (DCT coefficients), so this transformation was lossless. The option \"-copy all\" ensures that even all extra markers are preserved.\r\n\r\nEven if a file becomes greater, to my experience those aren't 25%. And it is more desireable to see an unsharp version of the whole picture than a few sharp lines of stars. The big part in the middle of that picture is way more interesting than those stars at the picture's top.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_keih","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809327,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ckg6c","id":"cvxuw","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48978-0127ae9f-6025-4539-926c-ac15a9a467e2-1566236777"}

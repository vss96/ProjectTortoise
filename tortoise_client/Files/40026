I used to feel the same way as this guy about 24bit being overkill, and still believe higher sample *rates* are overkill, but you can't argue with millions instead of tens of thousands of levels of volume. Luckily computer hardware has moved on enough to be able to take 24bit recording in its stride. I was slightly disappointed that the guy didn't expand on the beauty of purely analogue recordings; to the digital musician, they are quite spectacular, as they contain an *infinite* number of variations in both level and sample rate - limited only by the molecular makeup of the vinyl, in the case of records. If the signal passes through just one digital device, be it a digital reverb or a digital mixer, then the purity is lost. So a record made with a purely analogue signal path really is going to sound different, and they do.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vb19","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38220-f12434a0-8cf1-40ef-96eb-dcdf52a494ab-1566236772"}

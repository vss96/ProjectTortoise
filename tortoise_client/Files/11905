After going through the press-1-press-2 yada yada I managed to talk to some Indian guy who asked for my service tag, which I had to crawl under the desk to locate.  He then put me on hold and then came back to ask me for my phone number, my email address, before he would listen to my simple request.  He then gave me a reference number over the phone, told me that he would email me the same number, asked me to hold, and then had me talk to a supervisor to ask me about my experience with that conversation.  \r\n\r\nBut at least I can go to another PC vendor next time.  With Apple you're stuck with Apple.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wd3v","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809673,"author":"Rummy","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwg5y","parent_id":"t1_cwedm","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58486-e0120716-71d3-4739-b856-bb61dc5393c2-1566236780"}

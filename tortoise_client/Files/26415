First, they lose one of their premier programmers, by critcizing his lack of support for Israeli military tactics. \r\n\r\nNow they lose one of their premier security team by criticizing him for DOING HIS JOB.  I quit using PHP after the first one.  I hope a lot more people quit after this.\r\n\r\nAnd Louf... I don't see where wanting, and helping to make, PHP a more secure product is being a prima-donna.   He VOLUNTEERED to help them analyze and fix their product.  They clearly don't care about their own security.   As an open-source advocate, I don't take this sort of BS from Microsoft, and I wouldn't take it from Zend either.  \r\n\r\nSECURITY THROUGH OBSCURITY ..

{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v88c","controversiality":0,"body":"There's inflation and then there's inflation. One of the reasons that we care about CPI minus food and energy is that we want to know whether or not there are wage-oriented cost pressures in the economy. Labor is by far the largest cost to the US economy and so tracking whether or not wages are pushing prices up is a *huge* part of the inflation equation.\r\n\r\nIf one wants to know what the real spending power of Americans looks like, then one would want to consider the CPI with food and energy factored in. \r\n\r\nBut, the CPI+fuel+food numbers will lie to you because there's tons of price elasticity of demand in both food and energy markets. For example, would you stop buying organic chicken if it cost $10/lb instead of $3/lb? I sure would. That's $13 billion in price elasticity right there, just in a single food product category. \r\n\r\nCertainly, if gas prices get much higher, it'll be worth it to trade in my German sports car for a hybrid. Or, perhaps higher gas prices will spur me to commute to work via public transportation. Or, to cut out a day of commuting (20%) by using a home-office, instead.\r\n\r\nSo, do increases in energy prices really signal inflationary pressures on the US economy? The right answer is probably, \"somewhat.\" But, how much?","score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1166473942,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cv9jg","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv9fe","author_flair_text":null,"author":"kanagawa","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808860,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36669-b63a473a-b5c6-40e5-b9e9-86612464256a-1566236772"}

He gave nuclear secrets to the Chinese in exchange for campaign donations, he bombed the Balkans, there was Waco and Ruby Ridge on his watch, and don't forget the bizarre Elian Gonzalez saga, and that's just what I can think of off the top of my head.  The Clintons were involved in very shady dealings in Arkansas, a lot of people who had dirt on the Clintons died mysteriously (a FOIA request showed that the gun Vince Foster supposedly killed himself with had its serial number run by the ATF before the incident indicating it was a stolen gun or a gun used in a crime, e.g. not Vince Foster's gun).  \r\n\r\nClinton almost got nailed for perjury, but that's all they could get him on.  The actual crimes go far deeper.\r\n\r\nLook, each US president is successively worse than the previous one.  They each set a new low.  I fully expect Americans to come under the thumb of an actual despot pretty soon.  Hell, I got carded for buying cold medicine the other day.  So even buying cold medicine makes you a suspect in a crime now.  WTF?   Thanks Congress, thanks feds, you all fucking suck.  Henry Waxman can kiss a mule for all I care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":-2,"ups":-2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165585271,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cu3xr","parent_id":"t1_cu3f0","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808077,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15886-f5d405c9-9d56-4443-893b-2007b15837f5-1566236763"}

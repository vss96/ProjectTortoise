{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt;Okay, idiot, I have never said that the book was never intended to be published. \r\n\r\nAnd I never said that you did say that.\r\n\r\n&gt;I have maintained, from the beginning, that Ford intended his comments be kept from the public until after his death. \r\n\r\nAnd again, show me where the article states this.  You haven't yet. \r\n\r\nWhat you've shown is \"he said his comments could be published at any time after his death.\"  \r\n\r\nWhich, as I've tried to point out to you multiple times, is not the same as \"he said his comments could be published **only** at any time after his death.\"\r\n\r\nEspecially given the \"though\", which you consistently ignore.\r\n\r\n&gt;This means that the publishing of the book would be delayed until his death, not that it would \"never be done\".\r\n\r\nShow evidence.\r\n\r\n&gt;And I am the one with reading comprehension problems?\r\n\r\nYes.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8u1","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1167359160,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"Gilroy","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cwbfm","parent_id":"t1_cwb8a","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809584,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56095-5d178c7f-b898-4b0c-ac8d-5679396e6462-1566236779"}

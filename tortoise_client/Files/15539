{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uhc0","subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"Here's a link to the [survey itself](http://newspolls.org/survey.php?survey_id=23) and the [question](http://newspolls.org/question.php?question_id=716) providing the \"one third\" figure.\r\n\r\nI'm a little suspicious of this survey. First it asks people whether they are [\"more angry\"](http://newspolls.org/question.php?question_id=713) at the federal government than in the past, then presents questions about the government [covering up aliens](http://newspolls.org/question.php?question_id=715)  and [assisting the JFK assassination](http://newspolls.org/question.php?question_id=714)  as \"serious accusations\". These kinds of questions are leading respondents in a particular direction, not extracting unforced opinions. It would be like running through half a dozen questions about the DaVinci Code before asking whether the Pope is an honest guy.\r\n\r\nFinally, the question itself leaves lots of wiggle room: unnamed \"people\" in the federal government possibly \"took no action\" because they wanted a \"war in the Middle East\". Why the bit about the war if you just want an up or down opinion on the theory that people in a position to stop the attacks knew about them in advance and did nothing? Again, the survey is coloring the question to maximize the audience who will say \"somewhat likely\" by telling a \"somewhat likely\" story rather than just asking the question.\r\n\r\nNote that neither of the direct questions on theories of the Pentagon being hit with a [cruise missile](http://newspolls.org/question.php?question_id=717) or of the WTC collapse being the result of [planted explosives](http://newspolls.org/question.php?question_id=718) get even half the \"likely\" figure of the first question.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165937351,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_uhc0","edited":false,"id":"cuktv","author":"twoodfin","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808396,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24889-cbb14cbd-45fe-455a-b6e8-1285c2d174b2-1566236767"}

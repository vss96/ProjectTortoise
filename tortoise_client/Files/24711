{"body":"What total wankers!\r\n\r\nI kept bees for years, and collected most of my hives from swarms.  One of the safest times to handle bees is when they swarm as they fill their bellies with honey and are literally too full to sting.\r\n\r\nI truly hope those idiots do kill off all those bees in the walls of their house with bug spray.  The resulting stink as all those entombed bee bodies rot will be truly memorable.\r\n\r\nJust so's y'all know, the children were in *no* danger from the bees.  The children in question obviously were in danger from their 'adult' supervision and it's a pity we can't call someone about removing them.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w1t6","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167153618,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":22,"ups":22,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"TaraWheeler","edited":false,"id":"cw2jl","parent_id":"t3_w1t6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809415,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51371-63b8ba97-ff3c-4624-b0a9-e531b2b262e0-1566236778"}

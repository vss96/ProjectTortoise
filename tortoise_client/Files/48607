What this country needs is more protesters - people willing to get off their computers and go out and let government know how they feel. This is exactly what America was founded on, the ability to speak our truths as we see them and live them as we see fit. I do not agree with the people in the video, but they have the guts to go to DC and make their statement. Ask yourself how you're making your statement in rebuttal. Are you really standing up and being counted?","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ua04","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19522-08396c4f-238d-4e1f-ac18-8268d9fe3e54-1566236764"}

Evil as he was, Saddam Hussein was a man like any other, made in the image &amp; likeness of God; he was an infant once, and a little boy.  He laughed &amp; smiled and had friends.  He also murdered, raped and generally misbehaved.  He deserved and received death, but it's still a sad occasion.  I applaud his execution but regret its necessity; he could have done so much more with his life.","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58354-b21bbd6c-03a3-4a22-8104-217b325a54b5-1566236780"}

Infact, he has misinterpreted his findings.\r\n\r\nIt is true PS3s aren't selling like they used to on eBay. But the only people who actually bought PS3 at the astronomical prices were early adopters who a) simply wanted the console for bragging rights, b) wanted it for the cool factor or c) impatient gamers with too much cash on their hand. The people who really wanted PS3, which I should remind everyone is already an extremely expensive console, waited so that the inflation in price by eBay sellers would die and they naturally were not going to pay over the eBay prices have now started buying the console. In short, it's eBay sellers that have run out of their audience/market - not Sony. It's absurd to think that this \"trend\" is an indication of things to come. Sony is definitely on flimsy ground this time, they can't secure the same kind of userbare they did with PS2 (but that's a given, since they are taking huge risks this time) some market share is undoubtedly being taken by Wii and 360. But to say it's a dud is so far from the truth it's simply ignorant - especially to say it at this time in the console's launch.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w37e","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167194436,"ups":9,"score":9,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52307-a7ed92c4-cb8d-41d6-9a75-56e8136e0c90-1566236778"}

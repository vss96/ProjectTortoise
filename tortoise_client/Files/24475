Now, the people who write these can in no way forsee every possible event, so they try to cover the most likely happenings.  So when a situation like this comes up, which was probably not handled in the admininstrator's play book, the administrators must (ideally) look to the intent of the rule and make an intelligent response from that.  The intent of the rule likely isn't that guns are so inherently evil and icky things, that mere posession of it is enough to turn a good kid into a monster, that suspension in all cases is the right action.  Likely, the intent was the safety of the students at large.  Sure, you need to worry about if the kid is telling the truth; that is a judgment call the administrators have to make; and, likely, they should teach the students not to pick up the guns in future situations, and just to report it to a nearby teacher.  But \"zero tolerance\" is a buzzword for zero thought; and if we cannot trust administrators to think, and act right in a situation like this, then they ought not to be administrators.  Zero tolerance policies are the bane of good sense, and one of the silliest excuse for reason that has happened to public schools.  Look at the young boy in the photograph; he is a person, and this is happening to him, and does any right-minded person think that expulsion is a good thing for him? -- the school board ought not lose sight of the human level of the event.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uvo6","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30598-e168a02b-a20b-403c-8954-bb9d41792b5c-1566236769"}

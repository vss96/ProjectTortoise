So, yeah, I can understand higher rates of infections among a global population. However, on a personal level, it doesn't *have* to mean you're any more likely to get the infections if you practice good hygiene. \r\n\r\nIt's up to you whether you think the slight convenience of not having to peel back and wash in the shower every day is worth the trade-off of lower sensitivity and pain during the operation. I don't think it is.","score":18,"ups":18,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166377315,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cv4hz","parent_id":"t1_cv48z","author_flair_text":null,"author":"losvedir","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808765,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34114-9b3e93df-0928-4851-b47c-2229b4a6ea05-1566236771"}

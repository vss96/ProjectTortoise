As long as oil is bought and sold in dollars and as long as Saudi Arabia turned that revenue back into deposits at the Federal Reserve system, the US basically printed money to buy oil. That has been the case since 75'. You could say that the US went off the gold standard and onto the black gold standard. It's exactly that recycling of petrodollars that has allowed trade deficits to grow and when that recycling ends the current account becomes unsustainable.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vc4j","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808947,"author":"borg","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cve56","parent_id":"t1_cvdub","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38978-760f5b6f-18d8-4082-a819-0abef725387d-1566236773"}

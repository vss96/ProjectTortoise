For instance with the rules:\r\na-&gt;aa\r\nb-&gt;bb\r\nand the node for aabba, there would be an edge to the node aba, but not one to the node aaba.\r\n\r\nAlso, you do not actually build the graph. Instead you just do a breadth-first search (being careful to avoid loops). The algorithm to figure out the next-nodes is a little convoluted, but it should have polynomial running time.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10727-f5b1d63b-0e31-45b8-80a7-ec687fdd1eae-1566236761"}

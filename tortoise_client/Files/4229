The explanation in the papers is a little off. \r\n\r\nBasically, the artery and the vein fuse so that arterial blood is shunted into the vein. This can result in  bleeding because the thin walls of the vein cannot handle the higher pressure of the blood coming from the artery. They do grow together in a tangle - but it's the fusion and shunting of blood that's the key. \r\n\r\nNormally what happens is that arterial blood is channeled through capillaries before entering venous circulation. \r\n\r\nA-V fistulas are also where stigmata (bleeding of the hands or feet to resemble Christ) come from. Basically, a person sticks themselves over and over with a sharp object until the scarring results in an a-v fistula and then even when the skin is healed over you will get small bleeding. \r\n\r\nI once had a dog that recovered from being hit by a car heal in this manner, so one of its' feet would occ. bleed right through the skin. It would have been cool to have been able to go back in and try to find the fused vessels and remove them, but the owner didn't want to do any surgery.","controversiality":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166128431,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cut6v","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_upuh","author":"CAcyclist","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808551,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28802-f221eb8d-25be-4fbf-88cc-adb43c88abbd-1566236768"}

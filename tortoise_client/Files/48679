All of the $2,000+ PS3's were still only $600 to Sony, so they reaped none of the benefits of a high-demand situation.\r\n\r\nNintendo is still losing money by not meeting demand (the price over retail is once again going to consumers, not the company), but they have provided substantially more units available to sell, so Nintendo can garner more profit.\r\n\r\nSo, regardless of what eBay prices are, the company only makes money per unit sold.  If eBay prices are any indicator of demand for a product, Nintendo will continue to make more money as they produce machines faster than Sony has been doing.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52687-1c7f63e7-d7bf-4699-9edc-257d084ec40f-1566236778"}

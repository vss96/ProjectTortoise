(^_^) Most translators on German television are far from professional. *Especially* the ones employed by news channels.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after the Columbia disaster, the German news channels were *still* at odds with themselves on whether 240,000 feet correspond to 70 km, 240 km or 240 miles. No shit. And you talk about subtleties...\r\n\r\n(And don't even get me started on those Discovery Channel documentaries running on N24. They are so badly translated they make my ears bleed. Seriously, those translations are so awfully fucked up in so many ways, it's truly unbelievable.)\r\n\r\nA professional translator *does* get \"the subtly different meaning in both languages\". The point is, not everyone is a professional translator. Simply getting yourself employed by a TV channel and putting \"professional translator\" on your business card doesn't mean jack. Someone who translates \"we created a monster\" or \"that makes sense\" literally is a moron, not a translator. Period.\r\n\r\nThen again, nevermind English -- those folks employed by German television can't even write/speak proper *German*. Honestly, I am yet to find another country in which everything from commercials to news, from openings to titles to crawl bars to inserts is so chock-full of typographical, grammatical, orthographical and syntactical errors, flaws, mistakes and lapses.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u7pv","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18626-67f07ae1-872c-48aa-99a2-df19e79dee6d-1566236764"}

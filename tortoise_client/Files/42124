Maybe this kid was a manipulative piece of crap who coerced a drunk 17 year old and a naive 15 year old to make a video show with him, undoubtedly to catalog their love? When I first read the headline, I thought they were lovebirds or something. After reading the full story, I think this guy was pretty dirty to say the least. He also had a chance to plea out for the 17 year old, but chose not to, so the prosecutor went full force with the charge against the 15 year old.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vcwe","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38465-45191342-e7f5-46ea-be46-21f4e63ead96-1566236773"}

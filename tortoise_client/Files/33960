In that manner, the Arabs have \r\n&gt; goaded the Israelis into striking at them.\r\n\r\nThis is the usual pernicious nonsense.  The question of who hit who first is a matter of presentation: in the US, Israel is depicted as 'retaliating', or 'defending', when any sober analysis of the situation would yield the opposite conclusion.  Israel has conducted a brutal military occupation since 1967, imprisoning millions of people in a virtual hell, and killing thousands.  The response of the Palestinians to this extreme form of state terror has been to strike back with the weapons of the weak.\r\n\r\nIsrael is a nasty place, the last vestige of the European colonialism that screwed up the planet.  At the moment, because of political and technological circumstances, Israel is militarily more powerful than its neighbours, and has, of course, a rather large friend with a rather large stick to back it up.  This is a good time for the Israelis to make peace, and I'm surprised they're too stupid to realise this.\r\n\r\nBecause, time passes, cirumstances change, and when the US finally concedes defeat (by declaring victory), and gets out of Iraq, the Israelis might be facing a somewhat colder reality.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think Israeli stupidity comes from overconfidence, chauvinism, and a quite mindboggling level of anti-Arab racism.  A US general recently called the IDF \"a bunch of arrogant pricks who wouldn't last ten minutes on a European battlefield.\"  They may get their bluff called.\r\n\r\nThe Arab Conference (a sort of screwed up version of the European balance of powers in the 18th and 19th centuries) is tilted in Israel's favour, with weak despotic states depending on alliance with the US for survival.  A much colder wind may blow when Iraq is deserted.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vija","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43011-ce8e3b3c-71f0-4070-8b8a-35fe3540ec7f-1566236774"}

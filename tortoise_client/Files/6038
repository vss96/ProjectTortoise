We can still have race conditions or leak resources in many programming languages. Newer languages should make these mistakes impossible. We can also learn from existing languages. For instance, the messaging model in Erlang prevents many types of timing problems. Functional languages may eliminate the many types of bugs which arise from side effects. The essence of a design should not be concerned with timing or unexpected side effects, so whenever possible this should be solved in the language itself.\r\n\r\n* Make validation of designs easy. How about the following requirement for a new programming language: It must be straightforward to write a unit test to reproduce any possible bug.  Since designs must be validated with computer simulation, we must make those simulations easy. Huge strides have been made with various unit testing frameworks, but there are still shortcomings. Proofs of correctness are impractical for most systems, but the ability to easily assert a system doesn't have a particular bug is the next best thing. Furthermore, any bug discovered at any time should be added to the test suite to make sure it never occurs again. This ensures the defect rate of a system trends towards zero.\r\n\r\n* Design and code should merge into a single artifact. We still need design at a higher level than current programming languages, but this design needs to be an asset rather than a burden that gets out of synch with the code.\r\n\r\nOriginally from my blog post:\r\n\r\nhttp://toomuchcode.blogspot.com/2006/11/software-has-held-more-promise-and-yet.html\r\n\r\nedit: fix some formatting","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807682,"gilded":0,"id":"ctip1","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tif6","author":"brush","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6069-d5fb749f-04e3-4e1d-9d87-5d9c16fbebb2-1566236760"}

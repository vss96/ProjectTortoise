Worse yet it is a multi or incremental backup so what you get is 600 megs of the same swill over and over.  The disk images aren't labelled many are just copies of crawly crypt cds, atari compendium and others. From what I have been able to determine is that this lamer bought a bunch of CDs from toad computers when they were in business and burned them. It would be nice if he had the decency of a last informing you which disk images were which cds. I was so horked off at this tosser I thought about creting my own DVD set and marketing it on ebay. It would be far better than the swill this guy slapped together. To top it off 4 disks are nothing but wav files of crappy techno loops. How interested is the average atari user in wav (microsoft file type) files? Not bloody much I can tell you. Save your money don't buy this tripe. You have been warned. \r\nAn old atarian.\r\n-Karl","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48142-035bc335-913e-4b1f-83da-f990d2772e10-1566236777"}

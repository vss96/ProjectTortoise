In the long run the language that makes libraries easier to write will accumulate more of them, and hence become more powerful.\"\r\n\r\nThis argument has a large flaw in it, namely the current state of libraries doesn't reflect this claim.  The largest and most powerful collection of libraries seem to be .NET, CPAN, and the Java libs, certainly not Lisp libraries.\r\n\r\nBut the advocates of Lisp would argue that it's the most powerful language, and it's clearly been around for a long time, yet the Lisp community has not accumulated the most powerful collection of libraries.  So unless the next 40 years are going to be different from the previous 40 years, you can't really assert that language power is going to automatically lead to a rich set of libraries.\r\n\r\nI stand by my original comment in the previous article that programming is more about APIs and libraries than about writing their own code, and that if you are focused on measuring code-writing performance, you are just measuring the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nI also disagree with his claim that this is unmeasurable because doing a real-world test is too expensive.  As long as the project is solvable in a few programmer-weeks, you can test it out with different languages.  I took a computer science class (Comp314 at Rice) where we were expected to write a web browser in 2 weeks.  It wouldn't be that hard to have a programming test which incorporated a database, a web or GUI front end, and some kind of client/server architecture, e.g. implementing a small version of Nagios, or an IM client, or some other toy application.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry but writing a command line application that parses a CSV file and does some fancy algorithm to simulate monkeys writing Shakespeare is about as relevant to modern software engineering as voodoo is to modern medicine.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ujjm","subreddit":"programming","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1165948350,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25288-68420c1b-1831-4b64-9a6a-33184dbe4881-1566236767"}

I said: \"when sth is controversial, go see it for yourself\". Go read it again &amp; again or go examine your head, you retarted paranoid.\r\n\r\nMoving pictures.. of course you have only seen a subset of moving pictures with le cruel Israel. You haven't seen pictures of women got stoned, lynches, public hanging. You haven't heard of Theo Van Gogh killed in Holland for making a movie about women in Islam. And when I showed you links of muslim manifestation in UK with the posters \"Europe wait for your 9/11\" and \"Freedom go to hell\" you responded that it's their right to express their feelings. So it's clean you are very selective when speaking of information sources. Then again, I proposed you to go there instead of relying on selective sources. It's harder to MISS some insight when it's under your nose, you misinformed asshole.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tfob","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808689,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"wojtekk","parent_id":"t1_cu7v4","edited":false,"id":"cv0jy","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32291-721880bb-d306-4849-beaa-034ca301c9e6-1566236770"}

Generally what happens is that they celebrate the pile of children's bodies left by the Mayans.\r\n\r\nEven more unfortunate is that \"beliefs\" are insufficient to explain human acts. That's because beliefs are not explanations but rather they are facts *in need of* explanation. And no you may not explain beliefs by appealing to other beliefs!\r\n\r\nBeliefs can only be explained by interaction with reality. And where they cannot be so explained then they must be explained by cognitive biases (systematic errors) and psychoses (inability to perceive reality). The person who watches Mayan sacrifice and is straightforwardly horrified at it, has a better grasp on why the Mayans did what they did (they were nutters) than someone taken in by some pseudo-rational line of bullshit.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself why Americans support the massacre of Iraqis and the oppression of Palestinians. Is it that they trust the mainstream media and the federal government? For what possible reason should they trust their media or government? Nothing in their experience can justify such trust. So it's clear that Americans are nutters. And in particular that they are bloodthirsty psychos who want a suitably large ritual sacrifice of blood.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u82w","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165707684,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19236-f8ee87fb-c112-4e3d-b664-9e455a4c221b-1566236764"}

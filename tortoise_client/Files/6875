The PS2 had lackluster launch titles, but it also had no competition and people still bought buckets of it because it was also a very cheap DVD player. So developers had a very strong incentive to make games for the PS2 - in fact they would have been retarded not to. The PS3 is different as there are so few of them that developers would actually lose money making a PS3 exclusive, as they would never break even with such a small user base, let alone make a profit. It has been confirmed that several games originally intended as PS3 exclusives will actually be multiplatform titles, the latest in this trend being Sega's Virtua Fighter 5. Put yourself in the shoes of a very capable game development studio: is there any reason you *should* develop for the PS3?\r\n\r\nIt might be premature to predict Sayonara for Sony, but they're *definitely* feeling the heat.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w37e","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":13,"ups":13,"created_utc":1167182580,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52095-d9e01df3-e1ec-47b0-9afc-5da53665c3cf-1566236778"}

Intimidation and getting a reputation as a crazy fuck can go a long ways when dealing with people whom you have to interact with on a regular basis (like classmates).  It can help you avoid a fuckload of fighting.  Way more than running away is ever going to do.  Trust me, I  was a runner.  They don't stop coming.  There's always tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe rest is about \"once it's on...it's on\".  If you're not using every advantage you have, you're fighting wrong.  When defending yourself, you fight until the threat is over and you don't worry about hurting their itty bitty feelings.  \r\n\r\nAre you seriously going to tell me that the reason you won't hit someone in the balls is because if you miss it's going to be worse? Why not curl up into a ball and scream while you're at it?  If I can hit someone in the back of the head with a fucking rock and it gets me out of the situation with my life and my teeth, I'll hit a motherfucker with a fucking rock.","link_id":"t3_vjjh","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44184-dc27eae0-fb32-457c-947d-d268d70b9eae-1566236774"}

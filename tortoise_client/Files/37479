Nobody can force them to be ready.  It will take generations, if it ever happens.  Destroying the infrastructure didn't help this endeavor at all.  Especially when it was done by the people from the \"Land of Freedom and Democracy.\"\r\n\r\nThen there's the problem of the artificial state of Iraq.  The border lines were drawn arbitrarily by the British a hundred years ago.  Only a ruthless dictator was able to unify the disparate groups of people.  Now, we should redraw the borders to facilitate self-determination, a necessity of democracy.  Thus, the Kurds should be given their own nation in the north.  The 100% Shia areas in the east should be allowed to secede and join Iran if they desire.  The mixed Sunni/Shia portions of Iraq are still a problem.  There may be a way to get those people to stop killing each other and cooperate.\r\n\r\nIf Bush **really** wanted to fix the mess in Iraq, he would garner support of Muslim leaders.  He would travel to Iraq and Iran and visit with the Sunni and Shia religious leaders.  He would ask them to condemn the killing.  If Bush was a man of quality, he would do this.  Unfortunately, as the blogger points out, Bush doesn't know what he's doing.  :(  There is so much blood on his head... on all of our heads.  When the next terrorist attack occurs in the USA, how can anyone say we don't deserve it? ****shame****","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808221,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cubin","parent_id":"t1_cu9wb","author":"mleonhard","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20029-7ebead1e-9692-4f27-af42-285326fefc02-1566236765"}

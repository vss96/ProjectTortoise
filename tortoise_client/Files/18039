They don't get any commission.\r\n\r\nI used to work as a retail rep for HP: I worked just like the store reps, except that I was paid by HP (actually, a marketing company under contract with HP) rather than the store, and would push only HP products.  I floated between CompUSA, Best Buy, and Circuit City.  Of the three, Best Buy was by far the most horrible place to work.  I nearly got thrown out of one store for *not* lying to a customer.\r\n\r\n(By the way, I had a similar incident at Circuit City but it didn't escalate nearly as far.  CompUSA is easily the most upstanding of the three.)","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165373008,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10549-5b2290e0-1cb4-4ec7-af88-1688a201a6a3-1566236761"}

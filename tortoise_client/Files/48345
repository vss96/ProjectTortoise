The article basically matches what I see in the Boston area: prices are down about 25-35% from where they were a year ago.  However, when that's a drop from a million to $750k, when 10 years ago the same house would fetch maybe $300-400k, it's hard to be too sympathetic.  I think prices *still* have a long way to go.\r\n\r\nBTW, houses here are not crappy, energy-inefficient, pressboard-and-vinyl boxes.  Many are quite charming historic homes, often built 100+ years ago, and within walking distance of the center of town.  But people here frequently have high-paying tech jobs, which let them take out huge mortgages at what have been very low interest rates.  That inflated home prices on the way up, which means they have a long way to deflate on the way down.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvcu","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13034-60e0fe88-0a74-4733-8550-524ef1ecc34c-1566236762"}

Now, suppose that I hold one unmanaged resource (one OS handle). I stripped all the other code from the article, I still need 15 (25 counting in {s and }s) additional lines of code. WTF!?\r\n\r\nCompare this to plain old C++:\r\n\r\nmy_class::~my_class()\r\n{\r\n  CloseHandle(my_handle);\r\n}\r\n\r\nI wonder if IDisposable could have been implemented at a framework level. Writing *so much* code to close one friggin' handle is plain ridiculous.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_3b8o","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u3oe","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808078,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Gotebe","parent_id":"t3_u3oe","id":"cu41j","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15922-aca6c291-7f59-4624-b690-e827eaa79e17-1566236763"}

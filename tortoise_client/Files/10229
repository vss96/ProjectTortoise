Just tradition.\r\n \r\n&gt; 2. Scatological humor.\r\n\r\n&gt; 3. Finding the Caganer is a fun game, especially for children.\r\n\r\n&gt; 4. The Caganer, by creating feces, is fertilizing the Earth. However, this is probably an a posteriori explanation, and nobody would say they put the Caganer on the Nativity scene for this reason.\r\n\r\n&gt; 5.

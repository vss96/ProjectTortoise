I was stopped by a policeman in the 1970s and, in front of witnesses, he said he would kill me if he got the chance.  My lawyer advised me to not protest this as, if I did, someday they would find me dead for certain.\r\n\r\nI have first-hand or one person removed (i.e., something that happened to a personal friend of mine) information on several incidents like this which is one of the reasons I have more confidence in [jury nullification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_Nullification) than in lawyers and judges.\r\n\r\nBy the way, many years later I found out the policeman had threatened me because his fianc√©e was cheating on him with a guy who rode a motorcycle the same color as mine.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v4jc","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808795,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"keylime","parent_id":"t3_v4jc","id":"cv62p","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34994-1a90763e-ef54-45c0-a9dc-3d76b8a7525f-1566236771"}

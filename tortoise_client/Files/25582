Each has 3 possible outcomes (left, balance, right). This is equivalent to a register made up of 3 trinary bits[1]. If you set up the permutations of the weightings correctly then the solution will be the decimal conversion of the outcomes.\r\n\r\nNow your puzzle is to solve for the permutations that will end up giving you these trinary bits. A hint is in the second puzzle that the article gives you.\r\n\r\n[1] bit is \"**b**inary dig**it**.\" I support trinary digit should be \"tit\".","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_ueqk","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808308,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"fnord123","id":"cug6h","parent_id":"t1_cufi2","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22504-b5cec9f1-8834-48f5-b557-2e89bc8bea5d-1566236766"}

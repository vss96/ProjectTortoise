IDEs are canvases, classes are paints, methods are brush strokes (and in that same respect, show me where unnecessarily long brush strokes created a masterpiece) and the keyboard is the brush. The great part about programming is you aren't limited to a set amount of colors.\r\n\r\nSecondly, It's true that the programmer doesn't have time to do EVERYTHING properly but there should be a set of best practices that should be followed regardless of timeframe. The guidelines presented by the author are an excellent start. \r\n\r\nThe time argument has been played and rejected many times (Steve Mcconnell's Code Complete proves much of it). Any developer worth their snuff knows that it takes more time to fix bugs when code isn't developed \"properly\" in the first place. Pre-factoring and pragmatic programming leads to less bugs, cleaner code, and is inversely proportional to development and maintenance cycle times.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u0r5","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1165545428,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15145-2066097d-f860-473a-85c3-4b096c274807-1566236762"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"I have a suggestion to you and anyone else that is making a post here (atheist OR theist) actually watch this movie in it's entirety. I have done so, well before this post actually, and because of that I think I can justify my OPINION.\r\n1) This is not the average Christian camp. This is far beyond that. Note in the movie a christian even phones in expressing that these are not the same morals he was taught. \r\n2) Teaching your children that Global Warming doesn't exist is wrong. Do your research please. Global Warming is not a debated issue anymore it is a fact. \r\n3) SHE compared her motives to that of Muslim extremist. Not the director and not these posters. SHE DID.\r\n4) Creationism is not a valid theory to combat Evolution. I don't care what faith your from, not exposing your kids to the facts and evidence is hurting them in the future. \r\n\r\nAs an atheist I would like to make it very clear that this isn't about religion vs atheism. It's about this particular camp and the things that they do there should be considered wrong no matter what. These children may not be brainwashed but the attempt is clear.\r\n\r\nIf you want a more 1-on-1 discussion about this please feel free to email me. I'd love to pick your argument apart piece by piece:\r\ncman04_99@yahoo.com\r\n-Cheers!","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ua04","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165780803,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"cman_04","parent_id":"t1_cubii","id":"cucnq","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808242,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20616-8ff2c44b-28d4-437c-9920-57b8a7f5bb27-1566236765"}

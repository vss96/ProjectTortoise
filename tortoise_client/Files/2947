Maybe the ancients didn't know about it and couldn't ascribe its invention to their gods...?\r\n\r\nAs one of 'those' atheists who have studied scripture (in their original languages) I can't comprehend why people of faith have such resistance to the notion that humans wrote these books. \r\n\r\nThis doesn't undermine their value as books of great historical, literary, philosophical and moral value (carnage and mass extermination aside), if anything it allows a much more honest and open debate about the kind of cultures who developed these early belief systems. Sure this is at odds with what the power brokers at the helm of each faith actually wants but then they have a power interest in maintaining the false notion that the books are divine.","score":9,"ups":9,"created_utc":1166983292,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvxfx","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvxf0","author":"stubble","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809318,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48711-f293a9c6-4421-4937-9283-6923dea36535-1566236777"}

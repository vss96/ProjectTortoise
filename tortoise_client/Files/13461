What I'm saying is that in a case where you know you are misleading and taking advantage of someone else's foolishness then perhaps you've crossed the line.\r\n\r\nWhich means, I guess, that I wish people had compassion and morals. \r\n\r\nI never said we should pass a law. When a society encounters this kind of behavior social mechanisms are used to deal with the problem. (and yes, this does lead to some social mechanisms being used to attack people who are not wrong, they merely have the wrong religion, or skin color, or gender, so it isn't a catch all solution). \r\n\r\nSo my proposed solution is really nothing more than what Reddit already is nowadays - the place you go to learn who is in need of scorn (and while I'm partially kidding, I'm partially not).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I do take your point, and I wasn't implying legal sanctions.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165110522,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctakc","id":"ctega","author":"Random","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807601,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4218-a64575fa-a847-49a8-a962-aae9b7add31c-1566236759"}

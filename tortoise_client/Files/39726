Maybe some creative sound engineers too (not every band has a dedicated engineer anyway). Say 20,000 people.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one billion per year ($3 per american citizen per year), you can offer them the following deal: \"$50,000 per year to allow unlimited non-commercial use of your music, and you can make extra money from live gigs, TV shows, etc\". I bet the majority would accept and only the top 1% divas, their fat-cat producers, and their distribution chains would still insist on crippling the computer industry with DRM.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47818-8c0a0dad-e6c2-4cd1-9ed4-a659453960ad-1566236775"}

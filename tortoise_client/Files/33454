I've been in a couple of debates with people arguing for theism in which they've insisted that I could not defend atheism because I was, in their terms, an agnostic.

What many people aren't aware of is that atheism and agnosticism are at many times compatible 'beliefs' (or at least they can overlap). \r\n\r\nGood little relevant piece by Bertrand Russell: http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm\r\n\r\n","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167000765,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvxcw","edited":false,"id":"cvy2j","author":"wolfsleepy","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809331,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49092-a7c5ff93-f535-4a81-9159-49a5f40d0f2d-1566236777"}

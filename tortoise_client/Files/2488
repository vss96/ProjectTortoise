It is not just gypsies and mainlanders, there's more to the class structure than elsewhere in the world. It is complex enough that a particular caste can be regarded well in some regions or villages and poorly in others. People do NOT sell their own kids off to beggar masters, they happen to kidnap others kids to do that. Every country has its bad apples pica. Do you think child pornography and prostitution rings are being run by blacks and Latinos here? Is that a lesser crime?\r\n\r\nI find your predilection for generalization intriguing. A single factoid fitting in with your preexisting set of beliefs is enough to compel you into thinking that the behavior is symptomatic of an entire population. \r\n\r\nIf I were you, I would go ahead and conjecture that all racists have similar tendencies where they attribute highly visible crimes to the psychological make up of a community, but I'll hold that back for want of more specimen.\r\n\r\nDo you make an effort to seek out information sources that run counter to your beliefs? You should read 'A fine Balance' by Rohinton Mistry to better appreciate the complexity of caste based interactions. It is fiction, but tells a vivid tale that many Indians can relate to realities they have been subject to before.  \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0h7","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167164995,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51643-8c63555a-0821-4ac3-8fd4-6000f3a5aab2-1566236778"}

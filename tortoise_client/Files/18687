If you have ever heard of stenography then you know that a message can be hidden in another message. Now imagine that the message that you hiding the first one in isn't a jpeg or something like that but  plain text itself. Then you crack the first message but the real message is hidden in that text. \r\n I 'm not sure about this but I also think it is possible to encrypt text so that it \"decrypts\" rather quickly using an easier cipher. Think about it, if you are using a real cipher isn't there a key that make your cipher text look just like a ROT-13 of some other message? If not then is there some way to exploit the fact that your function isn't onto?\r\n\r\n\r\n ... sorry didn't see the last point on the first post about stenography.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31892-262b0767-d59c-4468-a2a3-e7e7abb04ca5-1566236770"}

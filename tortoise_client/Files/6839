{"body":"The one thing I liked especially:\r\n&gt; “We love America, but have doubts,” Jack said. “They let Syria come in here in 1991 for help in Iraq.” Jack was referring to former Secretary of State James Baker, who green-lighted Syria’s invasion and overlordship in Lebanon in exchange for “help” during the first Persian Gulf War.\r\n\r\nSo the man that actively participated in ruining Lebanon now want to push his agenda in Iraq. You can see on Lebanon example what does it mean to give to Syria to influence....\r\n\r\n&gt; “The US will hand us over to the Syrians again for help in Iraq,” Antonios said. “That is what Washington is speaking of doing right now.”\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Actually, the Iraq Study Group (headed by none other than James Baker himself) explicitly said Lebanon is off the table, that Assad cannot expect any American support for his little imperialistic adventures. But this detail has been lost in the wash, and I can hardly blame Jack and Antonios for suspecting the worst now that Baker is back.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wgvv","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167555634,"ups":0,"score":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"marglexx","parent_id":"t3_wgvv","id":"cwj3o","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809727,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59909-62b460e3-6318-4a97-992f-2142ac875f1e-1566236780"}

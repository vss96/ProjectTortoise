Isn't that nice!\r\nAnd, the best part, if you finally get back on your feet, your ex can audit you and have payments increased.  And the state thinks that's great because \"don;t you want your kids to have the extra money?\"  Yea right.  Firstly, if they actually got that extra money, what could they possibly spend it on at their young age?  The benefactor is the ex wife who got half of everything plus these outrageous payments AND the ability to get more.  This is not fair and frankly is a major de-motivator for me.  Makes me feel as if the system  is in cahoots with the ex to screw me.  You just can't win.","controversiality":1,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807954,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_tvr2","edited":false,"id":"ctxcp","author":"Specul8","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12966-9c533c35-8c56-447e-be33-e3965c149c97-1566236762"}

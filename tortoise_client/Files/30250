{"body":"The first one especially so.\r\n\r\nBack in the late 90s, there was this thing called the Bubble, bankers were begging you to take and spend their money, companies could afford the gigantific machines, the excessive bandwidth, and the incredible SLAs that their superstitious business plans required, and that their IT teams loved to brag about.\r\n\r\nNow, they're more experienced, and they have tighter budgets, so they make business decisions, maybe even sound ones. They've finally noticed that planned downtime, properly announced, can be an hour a day, or a day or so every year. Plus, unplanned downtime doesn't automatically destroy businesses. So, they're taking advantage of these facts to significantly reduce their operating cost. Is that a problem?\r\n\r\nNote that community-based sites are different, I believe they require much shorter downtimes, maybe not at all. (Addiction, and all that.)\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm surprised by the two-weeks downtime of gap.com. That's way too much.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uesv","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165841080,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"boa13","id":"cufc7","parent_id":"t1_cuf8c","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808292,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22131-b7820453-4fdb-474f-8234-cfdf2c2a897e-1566236766"}

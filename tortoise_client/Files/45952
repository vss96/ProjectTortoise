You find the perfect method in Java but have to hunt down 15 other methods (some of them dead ends or which only halfway work) just to get the ends you want.\r\n\r\n* Are composed of RTFMer bullies.\r\n\r\n* Have no problem deprecating a method with careless disregard for code that's older than 6 months. A programming team may take 6 months to build something, but then it only lasts 2 months before they have to rewrite chunks of it because some dorkwad server room admin upgraded the Java.\r\n\r\n* Still think it's okay to run around with different vendor versions of Java compilers and incompatible J2EE servers.\r\n\r\n* Love your compiler too much, slowing down the pace of development. And don't you all just love how the compiler command line requires things specified a certain way with the right folder paths or the thing won't run.\r\n\r\n* Love to take 15 lines for what my language can do in 5.\r\n\r\n* Love to rename software design strategies with stupid new names.

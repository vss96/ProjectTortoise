Lots of places have a $2 bill that they keep always in the register and have the serial numbers on file with local law enforcement.  Since $2 bills are so rarely used, it's a TON easier after a robbery to tell other businesses to keep an eye out for a person spending a $2 bill than other denominations.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w9jz","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":18,"ups":18,"created_utc":1167338543,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55483-f152ed87-ebab-42a8-aa09-b271d99f3c07-1566236779"}

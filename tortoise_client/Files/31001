Which is it?\r\n\r\nWe are already researching better means of propulsion, but nothing is really being used yet.  Ion drives have already been invented, but they don't really work in atmosphere.  Unfortunately, actually implementing anything can't happen until we have a base in space or on the moon to better test these things.\r\n\r\nUnless we actually have a base somewhere off-planet, with actual colonist, we won't really get much going in terms of innovations and research.  We could do it in a space station, but lunar gravity might be a better place for it than a space station.\r\n\r\nThe moon also has resources that a space station doesn't.\r\n\r\nIf you ever want to see us get to space, we gotta do it now rather than wait.  If we wait, we'll never go.  We'll always have the issue of needing to focus the money here.\r\n\r\nSlate.com is wrong.  Rocket technology has improved in the last 50 years.  Materials are also lighter and will improve more.  But we might not be using rocket technology other than to exit gravity wells.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17600-d24ed9a9-bd5d-4cce-b7be-9ba8319e93f7-1566236763"}

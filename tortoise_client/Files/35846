Additionally, does Amazon have experience integrating their existing services with existing software and hardware solutions?  How do they have an upper hand over already established (non-DRM) stores?  \r\n\r\n(That said, competition is very good.  If Amazon were to enter the non-DRM music service market it would be a really good thing for consumers.  I'm just curious why you feel existing stores aren't meeting people's needs.)","created_utc":1166567841,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvf4t","edited":false,"id":"cvf6x","author_flair_text":null,"author":"psantora","retrieved_on":1473808968,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39552-faf29a43-393c-4bb9-a0da-485c523219c7-1566236773"}

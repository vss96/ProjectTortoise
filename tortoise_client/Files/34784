Someone recommended I read the publicly available first chapter of \"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\" and I was utterly awestruck at how perfectly and seamlessly Doctorow ripped off both William Gibson's prose style and Philip Dick's dysfunctional realities. The characters were as two-dimensional as Keanu Reeves in the movie adaptation of Johnny Mnemonic and the plot so turgid that I felt my friend owed me a favor after fought my way to the end of the chapter. But this friend of mine, a huge sci-fi fan from when we were kids, hadn't heard of Doctorow before a friend had sent him a link to BoingBoing (which, not coincidentally, was saturated with ads for Doctorow's latest book).\r\n\r\nI think Doctorow's hype machine is fueled solely by his status at BoingBoing and his ubiquitous appearances at any conference/mob/gathering/whathaveyou emphasizing style over substance. There are plenty of writers of his capacity who publish online and in the trades who don't have nearly the visibility he does, and I bet if he removed himself from these appearances and stopped writing for BoingBoing, you'd see just how far he gets on his writing talents alone.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tnlk","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807812,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rafuzo2","id":"ctpqi","parent_id":"t1_ctp4b","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9242-33ec37d5-64ff-496a-8523-435c84097362-1566236761"}

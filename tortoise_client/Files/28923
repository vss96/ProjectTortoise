Yes, everyone indents the code for easy reading. But using indenting for storing information is bad, and here's why:\r\n\r\nRefactoring. When you refactor code, you move it around. But problem with indenting is - it is relative to its surroundings. So you cannot move indenting around.\r\nWhen you move code to new place indenting is lost, so you have to restore it. If you did not store any information in indenting - no big deal. You can restore it manually, or you  can automate it. In lisp I use Ctrl-Alt-Q to automatically indent the code.\r\nBut if you did encode information into your indentation, then it is lost the moment you start moving code around.\r\nHow would you like when every time you move piece of code - all \"a\"s in it automatically disappear, so you have to manually hunt them down and reenter again ?\r\n\r\nI use python and like it a lot. But i use it for small scripts that are built once, and then never touched. I just schedule them, and forget about them.\r\n\r\nSecond reason whitespace is evil...is exactly because we MUST indent the code. I mean EVERYONE does it.\r\nThink about it - if everyone does some task, then it is a very obvious thought try to AUTOMATE that task.\r\nWith coding blocks or branching with whitespace - there's no way to automate indentation. You have to manually do it every time, for every line of code.\r\nAnd do not tell me that editors automatically jump on right position? because no one writes code sequentially. You always jump around the code, return back, add or remove lines etc.\r\n\r\nWith lisp no mater what i do with code - automatic indentation is 1 shortcut away.\r\nWith python - indentation is necessary chore.\r\n\r\nAnd i do not like chores.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uhgd","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1165875245,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-6,"ups":-6,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23355-0b9248b0-7055-42ee-a368-3d2390919c54-1566236766"}

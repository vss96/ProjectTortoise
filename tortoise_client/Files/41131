If a person with whose beliefs I fervently disagree says something that contributes to the conversation by making me think, or by bringing to light interesting and original points (whether or not I can refute them), there's a decent chance I'll upmod; at the very least, I won't downmod.  I reserve downmods for trolls and for thoughtless, inane, or hostile comments that detract from the discussion.\r\n\r\nThat said, I downmodded the root comment; one word comments with nothing to support them contribute nothing to (and in my opinion, detract from) the discussion, irrespective of whether or not I agree with the sentiment.","created_utc":1166493613,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":20,"ups":20,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37339-93e74aa2-4412-47ad-b265-6d37e8d04b47-1566236772"}

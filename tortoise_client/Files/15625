{"body":"Depends on the ratio of live set / available memory.  Stop-and-copy is usually used in the early stages of generational collection, when data is 90% or more garbage.  However, it wastes half the available memory, so many generational collectors use mark &amp; sweep for the tenured generation, so they don't need 250 MB of memory to support 125 MB of live objects.  (Actually, a stop &amp; copy collector running at 50% load will be collecting *continuously*, which isn't terribly efficient.  You typically want 4-5x the live set available for good stop &amp; copy performance.)\r\n\r\nThe rule of thumb I normally see for generational collectors is that the youngest generation (eden) should fit entirely within the processor's L2 cache and then each successive generation should roughly double in size.  Usually that means 2-3 copying spaces and then 1-2 mark &amp; sweep spaces.  \r\n\r\nMany embedded systems also use mark &amp; sweep, because you don't have memory to burn in consumer electronics.  And mark &amp; sweep is often more amenable to concurrent implementations.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w4aj","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167238476,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cw5n3","id":"cw5vd","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809480,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53209-485a01ed-7aca-4c46-9536-3f83b9a5121e-1566236778"}

My explanation was that SPOILER WARNING:\r\n\r\n1. Ignore even numbered dice\r\n2. Sum the odd numbered dice\r\n3. Subtract the number of odd numbered dice\r\n\r\nThen I wondered why the answer was always even.  There are two cases:\r\n\r\n1. There are an even number of odd numbered dice.  In that case there are 2n dice.  Suppose the dice have count 2a+1 2b+1, ... for 2n dice.  Since there are 2n of them the sum is even (there are 2n +1's).   We then subtract 2n (the number of dice).  Subtracting an even number from an even number always yields an even number.\r\n\r\n2. If there are an odd number of dice similar reasoning following with 2n+1 being subtrated from an odd number.  It's always the case that odd - odd is even.\r\n\r\nAside.  Proving that even - even is always even is trivial.  For two even number 2a and 2b 2a-2b is 2(a-b) which is even.  Similarly odd - odd is even because 2a+1 - (2b+1) = 2(a-b) which is even.\r\n\r\nJohn.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_taga","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3344-9f6dc6fa-3722-4af1-ba2d-4eb417da6d4e-1566236759"}

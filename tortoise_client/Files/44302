{"body":"shit article.\r\n\r\n* dukkha does not translate into suffering\r\n\r\n* Ainâ€™t nothin' that says you have to...seems to me one of the primary tenants could be described that you shouldn't accept anything that doesn't ring true in yourself.  Not to mention that I believe the later works came out and said that the early works were tailored for the locals (ie 'his monks').  Oh, and Fuck the Dali Lama.  Damn Tibetan Buddhists anyway...\r\n\r\n* Enlightenment is typically a transient state.  Otherwise the historical Buddha would have been able to condense his work into a decent single volume that any sod would easily be able to say 'of course, how could I have gotten it so wrong all of these years'.  Enlightenment is something to attain, and to attempt to remain in as much as possible.  Ideally, you'd live your life in the most perfect way possible...the goal of Buddhism...as I read it once, not a destination but a life long journey, or something like that...\r\n\r\n* I'm at a loss for words...wow, good thing that lady made it out with her life...who knows what could have happened!!!!111!!11!1\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBuddhism is different to people the world round, depending upon the local social and historical accretions, but one thing it remains is a way to try to improve yourself as a person.  \r\n\r\nTo the poster, zeroboss, I suggest you get a 'range' of books to read up on Buddhism about, instead of just leafing through one and making witty and uninformed remarks with a catchy and inaccurate title.\r\n\r\nWhere are the 'how to correct them' and the 'live a happy life' parts?\r\n\r\nWorthless worthless junk.  Why even bother reading about the historical Buddha unless you are just curious?  You might as well read a biography of Jesus, its going to be completely flavored by the bias of the author.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed Buddhism: Plain &amp; Simple by Steve Hagen because it does remove the mystic mumbo jumbo, fancy foreign words and other worthless bullshit that has accumulated onto Buddhism over the past two thousand plus years and cuts right down to the important bits...not perfect, but better than most books on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w7mg","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167280384,"author":"gaso","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cw7ui","parent_id":"t3_w7mg","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809518,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54346-83aa80fb-ef05-471f-84d4-8a5905e56a96-1566236779"}

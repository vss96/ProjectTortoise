High-quality professionally engineered multitrack recordings with session musicians, etc, television shows, and movies can be extremely expensive to produce. We love them, and listen to/watch them all the time- clearly they are worth having around. They could not exist without some sort of way for the creators to be compensated for them. Would you have a world without quality movies, music, and television shows? If so, I think that demonstrates the extremeness of your position, and I think most would disagree with you. If not, how do you propose they get made if the costs to produce them are high and people have no way of recouping those costs?","created_utc":1166902006,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47634-df0f8e40-fd87-4936-9ac0-976df765063b-1566236775"}

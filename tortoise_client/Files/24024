I guess I like to talk about the issue though because I like to see issues covered thoroughly rather than just accepting trite lines that pass for history, and because I'm reluctant to jump on bandwagons that criticise leaders whose actions had good outcomes for their people (and I'm not trying to hide the human rights mess in that - but I hope you see what I mean).\r\n\r\nIt used to amaze me at university that people would wear tshirts with Castro or Guevara yet talk about the United States as though it was an evil empire. Often in these reddit threads I feel that same sort of madness coming through and I like to challenge it.\r\n\r\nIt makes me uncomfortable that Pinochet was evil yet had a good outcome, particularly as I *don't* believe in means-to-ends types of thinking. So, I want to cover all aspects of the issue and get a feel for it and work out how it should have been.\r\n\r\n&gt; Pinochet deposed a democratically elected leader in a\r\n&gt; military coup\r\n\r\nI don't think this particular aspect is as simple as you present. If you'd been in charge of the army in a country that was on the edge of collapse as a direct result of the incompetence of the president and parliament was calling on him to be removed, and you had a feeling that if you didn't restore order someone else would - what would you do? What do you do in these circumstances?\r\n\r\nTurkey has managed to avoid becomming an Islamic state a few times over the last fifty years, and it is a country where the army has at times stepped in to restore what they judge to be democractic values.\r\n\r\nDo you really have simple explanations for these contraditions? And if not don't you find them intriguing and feel disdain for people who claim to have it all worked out yet want to ignore the fact that Chile was turned around so successfully in so little time after 1973?\r\n\r\n&gt; Leaders should be judged by how they act, not whether\r\n&gt; they are on your ideological team.\r\n\r\nI almost agree with you - but I think outcomes are more important than intent. Doing evil through the intention of doing good is simply not good enough.\r\n","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1165818971,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuegw","parent_id":"t1_cueae","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"cratuki","retrieved_on":1473808277,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21700-508ca0d2-266d-469b-b0ed-707e8a68a4a1-1566236765"}

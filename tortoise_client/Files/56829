{"body":"Consider the typical corporate payscale.\r\n\r\nThe one where a CEO makes $5 million+ per year and the average engineer $60k.\r\n\r\nThe people creating value are the engineers, and they don't need a CEO skimming off all the profits just so they can do the meaningful work. That is why startups are better.\r\n\r\nWhatever it is you are doing at your big company, you could do independantly for a better lifestyle and often more money. You would even make more money just quitting, then writing the software your company needed, and selling it back to them. \r\n\r\nThe fact is that engineers are not paid what they are worth, because engineers tend to be the type of person that doesn't know what they are worth and is willing to settle for an interesting problem to work on while sales, management and marketing play the political game to maximize their own personal wealth.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_t576","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165607802,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct8qj","id":"cu5qq","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808111,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16836-c327a051-2a2c-4e2e-b1ad-6c7fb328d66c-1566236763"}

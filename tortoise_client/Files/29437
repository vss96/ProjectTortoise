This prompted a huge influx of letters from outraged Americans who decried the barbarism of this culture's treatment of Man's Best Friend.  While some would say, \"to each, his own\", a majority of Americans *strongly* oppose killing and eating dogs.\r\n\r\nEthical vegetarians extend that kind of compassion to other animals as well, which means they feel very similarly about how an animal is treated regardless of its label as \"pet\" or \"being raised for food\".  Treatment of factory-farmed animals would be felony animal abuse if not for that legal black hole that exempts farmed animals from any kind of protection.  Being against it has nothing to do with being posh.\r\n\r\nIn the U.S., we are very pet-friendly, and our children's entertainment is full of talking animals.  This means that it is uncomfortable for many people to think about where their food comes from.  A very usual response is to react negatively against anyone who reminds them of it.\r\n\r\nAn interesting idea is that if everyone simply ate 10% less meat, a billion animals a year would be saved (not raised for slaughter).  We currently kill about 10 billion land animals a year in the U.S.\r\n\r\nSo, you don't have to make an all-or-nothing decision.  Eating meat even one meal less per week will make a practical difference on a large scale.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tryveg.com/cfi/toc/\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166216510,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuyl2","parent_id":"t1_cuwlt","edited":false,"author":"lemmikins","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808653,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31376-d78f5ab5-0408-4b07-9dd2-557bd3bccc0a-1566236769"}

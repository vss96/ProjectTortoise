Microsoft got started making language interpreters and compilers, then operating systems. Facebook is a make-your-own-webpage copycat. It could be implemented by any 1st rate programmer in a week.

Don't fool yourself into thinking that your website is something special, or that you're Bill Gates. Back in the day, Gates had the world by the balls--he beat IBM, he beat Apple, he beat Clinton's thugs; even now, he could destroy google if he wanted(*).\r\n\r\n(*) By releasing an ad-blocker as an IE update.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vw3y","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809303,"author":"mynameishere","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvwku","parent_id":"t3_vw3y","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48330-441b4808-da9f-4e98-a4c3-31cec36eafb7-1566236777"}

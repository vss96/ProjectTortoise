The clubs can have an arbitrarily low entrance fee.  Brewvies, for instance, has no fee for \"membership\" or any membership cards or anything like that.  It's just a combo bar/grill/theatre that allows smoking and drinking on the premises, and it is located in the heart of downtown Salt Lake City Utah.  Obviously the definition of \"Private Club\" is fairly loose here, and I doubt it's much more strict elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI don't like the smoke so I don't go there.  I have friends that don't mind it so they go there because it's nice to be able to eat a nice meal and maybe have a beer while watching a movie.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ubmh","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20916-6fe6e4c0-95aa-458a-9ecf-78dd30adcc2a-1566236765"}

A possible reason for the disparity between these \r\n&gt; figures is that the U.S. military enlisted corps is \r\n&gt; adamantly opposed to real progress toward a University\r\n&gt; degree amongst the rank-and-file.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is that the relative youthfulness of enlisted members is such that this level of progress is exactly what one might expect.\r\n\r\nI had trouble finding broader numbers, but the Wikipedia page for Lacklind AFB (the location he mentions) says that 79.8% of the people on base are aged 18 to 24.\r\n\r\nIf this number is representative of enlisted members in general, then it seems entirely unsurprising that more of them have \"some college\" than are holding degrees, especially since these are enlisted members of the military and are as such already pursuing an option widely regarded to be an *alternative* to college.\r\n","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166603905,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vg0w","edited":false,"id":"cvgut","author":"dionidium","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809000,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40473-2d0a5434-763b-4642-b3b0-a0dc05c654f2-1566236773"}

How can we know how to vote if we don't know and can't know what the politicians are up to?\r\n\r\nThey know full well that if we *did* know what they're up to, we'd be plenty pissed off. The citizens of the various fascist regimes of the 20th century certainly didn't know what their governments were up to.\r\n\r\nThis and the other recent examples of government going  behind closed doors is a very frightening warning sign.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808714,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v1ex","id":"cv1te","author":"NoFixedAbode","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32754-d0fac4ba-d315-4460-acca-853681206670-1566236770"}

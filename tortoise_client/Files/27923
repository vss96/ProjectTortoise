{"body":"I'm sure you could find dozens more songs that fit those chords. So what? You can find dozens if not hundreds of jazz tunes based on the simple chord progression known as \"rhythm changes.\" \r\n\r\nSee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_changes\r\n\r\nThe point of writing music isn't to use as many chords as possible. It's to use whatever chords make the most sense for the song you're trying to do. There are lots of great rock songs with only 3 chords -- add too many more chords to a rock song and it'll  start to sound like prog-rock wankery. Many of James Brown's best songs are one-chord vamps. Plenty of musical traditions pay no attention to harmony at all.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tn3v","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165310215,"author":"catlebrity","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cto5h","parent_id":"t3_tn3v","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807783,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8580-5593152a-17b7-4b78-a795-0287c6994adc-1566236760"}

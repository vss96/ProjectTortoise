(To be fair, C++ is old and you have to set your expectations accordingly).\r\n\r\nHis argument regarding C++ references is silly. C++ references and references in other languages are not exactly the same. Other references act like shared_ptr in C++, which is susceptible to the very thing he's complaining about.\r\n\r\nWhat other languages have generics and have it worse than C++? I honestly don't know.\r\n\r\nRe: opensource support: it's certainly a good thing, but I wouldn't say \"I love language X because many other people do, too.\" By that logic we all should love Perl.\r\n\r\nRe: integration with C/C++. D'oh. You could demand language X have better FFI. But, this is such a trivial thing that if this is your #5 for why you love C++, you are a very loving person.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v6rx","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166502210,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37533-f77ac926-e085-423b-be96-b343e001aaed-1566236772"}

One was 'gifted an talented' and went to accelerated classes with me one day a week, the other had learning disabilities.  I don't know exactly what the deal was, probably a problem during their deliver that led to one of them having blood cut off long enough to cause some brain damage.  Anyway the 'nature vs. nurture' starts from the moment of conception and the two are hard to separate.  \r\n\r\nNature vs. Nurture is not strictly a genetics vs. upbringing argument, but it should be.  That's a clear cut case.  If you don't start with good hardware as dictated by your genes, you're at a disadvantage for reaching the highest human potential.  And even with the best hardware in the world, if something goes wrong in your environment; missing a parent, stupid parents, falling on your head, getting the umbilical cord around your neck during delivery...  well it is all pretty obvious that both are important isn't it?\r\n\r\nFastest car in the world is going nowhere without clean gas, good tires and a flat road.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1164983973,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":3,"score":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1189-a2369994-340b-4c9d-9a1f-64ff4083a863-1566236758"}

There's essentially nowhere else in the world to invest your money right now, other than the USA, Europe, and a few other places. Compare the risks associated with buying interest-only loans in the USA against the risk of buying stock in China or buying long-term US Treasury Bonds, many of which have a total yield that is less than projected inflation. Bleah. \r\n\r\nIn general, people and companies with huge piles of cash tend to spread it around amongst a wide variety of investments, including mortgages, packages, and other real-estate derivatives and whatnot. The amount of risk that they build into their portfolio has everything to do with the number of other dollars out there competing each opportunity to make money.\r\n\r\nNone of this really indicates a fundamental flaw in the economic system. People or companies with lots of capital are much more risk tolerant on the level of individual investments because they're more likely to catch a bunch of the shooting stars. \r\n\r\nSo, this is a situation in which the _check book economics_ we all live with don't necessarily relate to the realities of the financial markets.\r\n\r\nAnyways, that's my arm-chair analysis.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36615-af3f6438-f1e9-47d1-bb54-4d71c4f4d6c7-1566236772"}

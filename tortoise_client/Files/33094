In all that time (probably 50-100 trips), I never had a single really bad trip (the most I ever did at once was probably six sugar cubes).  However, even after I gave up all drugs, I found I was really out of it which had a detrimintal effect on me in social situations for years afterwards.  I would warn that too much acid can have a cumulative effect that lasts a long time after the drugs have stopped being taken.  I'm not sure if that holds fro shrooms, too.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vdx0","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39511-72a9ec76-e677-44c7-a85c-349d64795c17-1566236773"}

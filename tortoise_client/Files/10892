Would you rather have your web designer spend time learning to program in whatever language(s) your developers use, or would you rather have them spend that time learning more about their tools, and figuring out how to do new, nifty things with CSS and XHTML?\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of technical depth to creating visual art; my usual web designer has a bewildering array of programs she uses (Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, Imageready, Painter, and even Bryce and Poser sometimes), and I don't understand most of what she says about techniques and styles. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, I only need a text editor and SFTP program to do my webapps.  Well, and a browser.\r\n\r\nTemplating systems often get in the way, causing the designer to have to change the design to accomodate them.  Avoid program logic in a templating system.  If your templating system has generic conditionals (\"if;else\") or exposes program variables or classes without any need to explicitly expose them, it's wrong.  :)\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1166735240,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44238-0f970770-1b6f-4880-aac3-29bf3f2d5267-1566236774"}

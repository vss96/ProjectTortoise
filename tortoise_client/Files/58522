An \"externality\" is something outside the market mechanism, i.e. a good or service that people receive but don't pay for (or a harm that they're not compensated for).  \"Positive\" externalities presumably mean the former only.  \"Network\" is what you'd expect - more people using it, and those additional people adding some value in some way.  So \"positive network externalities\" means that the more people use something, the more valuable it is, *and that value is not fully captured by the price mechanism*.\r\n\r\nThat part matters.  If the added value was part of the price producers receive for the service, you wouldn't have lock-in and other network effects.  Consumers would receive more benefit, but that would be offset by higher costs, so it'd just be a basic quality/price tradeoff.  But since you can't usually charge for *other* people using a service, consumers capture the full benefit, which makes it less enticing for them to switch to a new entrance.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wa1q","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56656-0af0f3cd-14ec-4bc2-9775-9d84ef6bd50c-1566236779"}

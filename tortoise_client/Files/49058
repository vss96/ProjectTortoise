I was not offering \"legitimate authorities\" at all.\r\n\r\nNor have you refuted any of this perspective.  You have simply offered a set of facts which you think justifies your own.  I disagree.\r\n\r\nWhat surprises me most about your perspective is that you are, at the same time, deeply suspicious of one set of Western elites, and at the same time display not only a deep trust of another set, but a belief that they can exercise omnipotent benevolence if they come to power.\r\n\r\nMore than anything else, this is reminiscent of the attitude of the Qing Dynasty mandarins toward Western powers in the 19th century.  It is a deeply narcissistic worldview.  It fails to attribute agency and power to external forces.\r\n\r\nI am not in any way a neocon.  (My views on foreign, though not domestic, policy, are best represented by [Larry Auster](http://www.amnation.com/vfr/). In fact, I think what is so dangerous about the neocons is that they combine this exact same narcissism with a tiny dose of reality.  A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.\r\n\r\nBut there are other ideas besides the ones you get in the official papers.  Let me offer you a brief introduction to reality as I see it.\r\n\r\nIran and Syria are not going to be \"supplicants\" in any transaction, any more than Queen Victoria was a \"supplicant\" of the Empress Tzu-Hsi.  The relationship is quite the opposite.  Read the recent message from Al-Zawahiri: his analysis of global politics is, in many ways, entirely correct.  He sees the West as a weak and decaying empire, which is exactly what it is.  The Ottomans are another good comparison.\r\n\r\nAll the supplication between the US and Iran and Syria is flowing, at present, from us to them.  Iran made some concessions after 9/11 because they were a little terrified.  Wouldn't you have been?  But the reality of the situation clearly showed that the US did not have, and has never had, the stomach to attack Iran, despite Iran's many attacks on us.  This is weakness by any name.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one thing the history of the Cold War shows is that the Soviets, Chinese, North Vietnamese, etc, for a long time consistently *overestimated* the US's willingness to counterattack, which is not surprising considering that any of the Communist leaders knew more about the dynamics of factional violence than the entire US government put together.  They are frequently recorded as being astounded at the stupidity and weakness of the US.  For example, when the US got rid of Ngo Dinh Diem because they thought he was too undemocratic, Ho Chi Minh declared that the war had been won then and there.  Of course he was right.\r\n\r\nIn other words, my view is that these hostile foreign organizations - governments, gangs, call them what you will - are not evil at all.  I have absolutely no interest in \"bringing them to justice.\"  I believe this is a horrible idea.  I believe that they are rational actors, and if they display any miscalculation it is irrational timidity.  They could probably push it a lot farther, and they would know this if they had a better understanding of domestic Western politics.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when you try to negotiate with a rational actor who has no rational reason to cooperate with you is a phenomenon where said actor \"won't take yes for an answer.\"  If you concede to their demands, their incentive is to simply replace those demands with a new and more extreme set of demands.  Sometimes they may make promises, which they will break.  At least, it is rational for them to break these promises.\r\n\r\nWhat is really hard for me to understand is why you, who are so deeply opposed to traditional American foreign policy, fail to understand that that policy has completely failed and is now dead.  The US does not have \"soft power.\"  Increasingly, it has what Europe has, which is no power at all.  Granted, it still has a lot of money, and it may be able to obtain temporary reprieves by buying off its enemies.  But they have no reason to stay bought, and they won't.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vq1i","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809320,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvxgd","parent_id":"t1_cvw8u","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48717-319e90da-1d68-446f-bea2-89a385b67b39-1566236777"}

Other MP3 players are better. Here's why:\r\n\r\n* They have a proprietary database on the things.\r\n* Can't just drag songs on the file system and it plays -- you have to use an iTunes or iTunes compatible program. Many other MP3 players allow you to just use the file system.\r\n* You can't easily pop out the battery and replace it.\r\n* Regardless what anyone says, I find the interface frustrating. If I want to end (not pause) the song, I want a button with a square on it. If I want to turn down the volume, and often I find myself going up and down the volume, I want an ordinary thumb wheel on the right side.\r\n* Who knows if iTunes doesn't \"call home\" (or phone the RIAA) when you do something you're not supposed to do with it? Shouldn't that be my business, not theirs to police me?\r\n* They're overpriced and mostly what you're paying for is the name brand.\r\n","score":-3,"ups":-3,"created_utc":1167545360,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_wi17","id":"cwit6","edited":false,"author":"supermike","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809722,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59753-90b07e00-58d7-460a-b0aa-18923884a29f-1566236780"}

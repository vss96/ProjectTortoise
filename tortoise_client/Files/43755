Then upload the 200MB image and let concerned citizens view the map in Google Maps view.\r\n\r\nOnce such a system become popular, everyone will know that in case they're lost, all they have to do is make an SOS sign or signal in some way such that a satellite could pick it up. And if the satellite detects the color orange or red, it can take slightly higher resolution pictures too.\r\n\r\nIf used nationally, it would probably be much cheaper than maintaining fleets of local helicopters for scanning and instead only use helicopters for the actual rescue part.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tmpb","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165278158,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7921-e793e385-9f71-47e8-9f3e-7f1ad35904a5-1566236760"}

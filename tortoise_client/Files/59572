{"body":"Clearly you've bought in to the propaganda.  A \"ticking bomb\" scenario is so improbable that we might as well assume it won't happen.  Consider what would be necessary for that particular event to happen:\r\n\r\n1. The bomber would have to plant the bomb completely undetected, on no surveillance at all.  But considering current trends, it's much more likely that the bomber would probably just choose to do it suicide style, and no \"ticking\" would ever occur.\r\n\r\n2. The authorities would have to know this bomb exists, somewhere, but have no intelligence whatsoever about its location.  The scenario also implies they know about when it will go off, but still not know its location.\r\n\r\n3. The authorities would have to find this person *and* confirm that they actually did know where the bomb was.\r\n\r\n4. No one else involved in planting the bomb could have means for detonating it early, say, by cell phone (as was done in Madrid) once they notice their comrades have been captured.\r\n\r\nThe point is, you can come up with hypotheticals all you want, but just because they work for a movie does not mean they'll happen.  More to the point, anything short of a rule is too flexible to be trusted.\r\n\r\nJust imagine, hypothetically, our intelligence is so bad that an event like they describe could occur without us knowing until the last second.  If that's the case, then it's probably equally as likely that we will just *think* that we have that scenario on our hands because of bad intelligence, and someone, say, you, get arrested because you've been visiting an OTB on the Upper East Side a lot, where notorious terrorists are known to meet.  Just imagine they start torturing you on the location of a non-existent bomb.  How is that hypothetical any less likely than the one they provide?  Just because you saw it on 24 doesn't mean it's going to happen.  We need to put our foot down, no torture, absolutely none, that's the rule.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v9pw","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":17,"ups":17,"created_utc":1166503520,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"tghw","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvb8p","parent_id":"t1_cvar2","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808893,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37567-f500b6bf-2ae4-423f-9e36-a35610ab6e85-1566236772"}

{"body":"I have an iPod but most of my music is from CD's I ripped from my collection or borrowed from the library.  No one mentions the fact that you can check out a CD and burn it then sync it with your iPod.  How is that any different than file swapping on Limewire or Acquisition?  I have downloaded music from iTunes and I have to say that the quality of the music is very good much better then the quality of the mp3's I downloaded. I have yet to experiment with downloading videos from iTunes.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_ujny","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165961018,"ups":0,"score":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"1Dunya","id":"cumkd","parent_id":"t3_ujny","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808428,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25742-3370167a-4a79-45a4-8f7e-d5feb4108838-1566236767"}

It was the only Nintendo console to do so.\r\n\r\n&gt; GameCube was the first console that Nintendo lost money on at launch, and even then, only in the single digits, and that loss was erased in six months.\r\n\r\n[link](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/editorialArt.cfm?artid=537&amp;CFID=20445274&amp;CFTOKEN=dd8b88e143346db0-4687B0D8-C09F-3E62-05452F93547BAE77)\r\n\r\nThe GameCube has been very profitable, though not necessarily very popular for Nintendo. I think if they would've taken a small loss on the Wii initially, it would've been a smart move. They could've made profits on the console within the next 6 months yet overall had a good deal more powerful machine.\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't expect it to compete directly with the PS3 and 360, but there are quite a few of us who value technology and gameplay. It may be my problem, but I can't enjoy 10-year old games no matter how hard I try. I just don't enjoy those experiences anymore. To me games with poor gameplay but great graphics are pretty much worthless, but I don't totally disregard graphics.\r\n\r\nI agree an extra controller would've been fine as well. I think that would've been a good value.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tdyf","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807610,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctey0","parent_id":"t1_ctevk","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4434-2bfb9f24-4954-4fed-b71e-eb2473b16906-1566236759"}

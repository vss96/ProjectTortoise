In the dark it could be pretty easy to wander off of that.  Also, there had been a substantial amount of snow in that area when they were lost and it didn't really warm up much for it to melt.\r\n\r\nI've heard people express surprise that someone in the lower 48 states could actually make a wrong turn and drive off into a situation where their lives would be in danger.  However, the area in question is  _very_ remote.  Heavily wooded and mountainous.  The snow came early this year as well - normally it probably wouldn't have been like that till around Christmas.","created_utc":1165442874,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":27,"ups":27,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctw78","id":"ctwe7","author_flair_text":null,"author":"UncleOxidant","retrieved_on":1473807936,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12546-ca7cb933-90bb-47a6-807f-5d4ab5c6f16a-1566236762"}

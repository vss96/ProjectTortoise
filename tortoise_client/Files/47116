I don't know how Bill Gates manages to do it, but since I acquired this dual-monitor setup last month, my productivity has *plummetted*, with the major culprits being:\r\n\r\n* mIRC always on top, and I find myself unconciously eying it to read new messages twice a minute, while the programming reference sits there in its shadow, and of course\r\n* reddit, refreshed every half an hour. Since I now think I can read articles on the other monitor without disrupting my workflow now, I do it with little to no guilt/inner resistance, and always end up wasting hours trying to turn all the blue links purple.\r\n\r\nI don't know about three monitors, but I suspect it would be worse. Reading the article with care is greatly advised; I smell some conspiracy behind this.\r\n\r\nedit: typo","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20332-b8ba81af-c07b-4cb5-ac65-20e27dfe2f6e-1566236765"}

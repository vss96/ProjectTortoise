{"body":"Ironically, I don't agree with Jamal. I was just pointing out a logical fallacy.\r\n\r\nThe reason I don't agree is because what one generation considers healthy might be considered poison to another.\r\n\r\nFor example, I remember my mother telling me that margarine was healthier than lard. Today we know that eating margarine is almost like injecting your veins with plastic, and should be avoided.\r\n\r\nHaving said that - I don't see taxation of junk food in order to subsidize heathier food as a form of personal regulation. If anything, it would make people freer to eat well, thus extending life.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tol1","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165359195,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"altheahouse","id":"ctrdj","parent_id":"t1_ctq53","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807844,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10099-002dac0f-138d-4a00-afb7-9987ac7c9a6a-1566236761"}

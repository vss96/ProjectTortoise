{"controversiality":0,"body":"I guess I see things a little too differently than you to fully understand what I think you're saying.  If you're tired of explaining yourself to people like me, you don't need to respond, but I am interested in your view.  You seem to state clearly that we have no moral obligation to pay taxes.  Do you feel it is unethical to benefit from the payment of taxes?  In other words, I take a Kantian approach that what's good for the goose must be good for the gander, and not paying taxes (on a large scale) means no public schools and no welfare for the mentally handicapped.  So is it unethical to advocate not paying taxes, but at the same time send your kids to public schools and/or receive disability payments from the gov't?\r\n\r\nIt appears that your answer would be that this is morally acceptable, so either I have misunderstood you or you have taken to position that cannot be simultaneously taken by everyone.

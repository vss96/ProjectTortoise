Presumably, I could find statistics for some region which had some unusually cold seasons. Would anyone seriously interpret that as a sign of global cooling?\r\n\r\nIn short, there is no way this article could cause anyone to start 'believing' in global warming, unless that person thinks anecdotal evidence can be used to make authoritative generalizations. Since no one would actually admit to thinking this way, the headline is just silly.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vm6j","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809154,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"pchiusano","edited":false,"id":"cvooz","parent_id":"t3_vm6j","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44353-c69838aa-8dc2-4b5b-9c6d-90a5447bba79-1566236774"}

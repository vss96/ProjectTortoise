The study went and found that an audience exists for an existing corporate news bias, rather than the other way around. Would  circulation go up or down if they started reporting the truth? It would go up. What would go down is advertiser interest, in the short term. [Case in point the hidden 100 company blacklist of Air America radio.](http://mediamatters.org/items/200610310008) The real customers of TV and newspapers are their advertisers, not the readers. \r\n\r\nNewspapers have local monopolies. Some may have a *presence* outside their market or to a limited extent nationally but all are essentially serving a captive audience.\r\n\r\nWith TV we have the same situation via regional monopolies of cable companies coupled with the bundles of channels that are predecided for the consumer.\r\n\r\nNeither of these institutions will lose market share for overt corporate political activism. The only lose when people go an entirely new media via disruptive technology ala the internet. On the Web there is real choice, there are no barriers to entry, and as a result we see that the news that  supposedly is going to a consuming reading base, can't has no market at all. When people have real choice they don't listen Bill O'Reilly and they don't read Tom Friedman, except in the context of illustration as to what is wrong with their overt political corporate media activism. \r\n\r\nThe NBER is a self congratulating study much like the ISG from the Baker-Hamiliton group which does not really address  the underlying problem, but rather attempts to corral public discourse into a narrow range of acceptable framings for public discussions of \"the  solution\".\r\n\r\nI am not \"attacking\" the study based of feelings, rather I'm illustrating its obvious weakness from experience. Corporate monopolies will continue to claim that there is no bias and that there is no overt control of media pipes, until they have no more pipes to control.  Watch and see.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u1yd","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23414-964dcf4a-56fa-464e-9341-0f0f98d10469-1566236766"}

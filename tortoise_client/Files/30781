From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetarism#The_rise_of_monetarism\r\n\"\"\"In the late 1980s, Paul Volcker was succeeded by Alan Greenspan, former follower of Ayn Rand, and a leading monetarist. His handling of monetary policy in the runup to the 1991 recession was criticised from the right as being excessively tight, and costing George H. W. Bush re-election. The incoming Democratic president Bill Clinton reappointed Alan Greenspan, and kept him as a core member of his economic team. Greenspan, while still fundamentally monetarist in orientation, argued that doctrinaire application of theory was insufficiently flexible for central banks to meet emerging situations.\"\"\"\r\n\r\nThere's some awfully big names in there. In the current situation it's quite a stretch to describe Greenspun's economics as 'kooky'.\r\n\r\nYou refer to 'economic voodoo'. 'Voodoo economics' was coined to describe the notion of supply-side economics which is not monetarism - the difference are briefly covered also at wikipedia:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics#Supply-side_vs._Monetarism_.26_New_Classical_Economics\r\n\r\nDid you end up getting hold of the Freidman videos?\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808277,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cueh0","parent_id":"t1_cueaf","author_flair_text":null,"author":"cratuki","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21702-66e1562d-e3d7-4cff-85d0-788c8f4e1278-1566236765"}

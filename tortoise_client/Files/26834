The UN is a big talking shop, and the only way to get action is to form consensus, at a minimum between the five permanent Security Council members.\r\n\r\nOne doesn't form consensus by cracking a whip. One forms consensus by avoiding needless provocation, and actually making an effort to take into account the concerns of other nations.\r\n\r\nActing as if all other 180-odd diplomats were clueless obstructionists is hardly going to get them to do what the U.S. would like. \r\n\r\nThe U.N. has no troops, by the way. It can only ask member states to contribute troops. The U.S. could very well send American troops to Darfur, just as it sent troops to Iraq, if it really wanted to, but the fact is that the Bush administration clearly feels the risk to American troops outweighs the benefits. Why should any other nation come to a different conclusion?\r\n\r\nThis administration claims diplomacy is one of its tools, but the aside captured some months ago where GWB said \"I felt like telling Kofi to call, to get on the phone to Assad and make something happen\" reveals the total lack of understanding here.\r\n\r\nWhy would Assad do what Kofi Annan says on the telephone? Does GWB do everything Kofi Annan calls and asks him to do? Of course not. Assad will do something when he perceives it to be in his best interest. Diplomacy is the art of creating that perception. It is not just telling people what to do and having them fall right in line.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807753,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctmea","edited":false,"id":"ctmls","author_flair_text":null,"author":"sickofthisshit","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7849-ae2e2675-48ad-492c-8a1b-6bb28e6ecd50-1566236760"}

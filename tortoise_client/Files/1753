This did not turn out well.\r\n\r\nMany of the points you have made are blatantly wrong in their implications, or irrelevant.\r\n\r\nAlso, China's military modernization is not a solid criticism in and of itself. Should it allow its military to grow more obsolete so as to appease a paranoid America tied up in foreign wars?\r\n\r\nThe only point you have leveraged that stands on its own is the issue of labor abuses and repression of dissent.\r\n\r\nTaiwan remains an issue, but China invading North Korea? Where the hell does this come from? Why invade North Korea now? Because it can? You aren't making any sense.\r\n\r\nI also like how you, who claims to be a conservative Republican, make it sound so easy to invade countries. Just three electric power plants, right?\r\n\r\nA major reason why America could not do a thing if China did invade these countries is due to being tied up in Iraq. \r\n\r\nChina's rise to power as an authoritarian regime that does not respect human rights is certainly a concern, but we all need to make sure we have sound reasons for any foreign policy we embark upon regardless of our party affiliations.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165766838,"score":13,"ups":13,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20236-77cd0a8c-abe1-425b-a9c1-e9189c8672f0-1566236765"}

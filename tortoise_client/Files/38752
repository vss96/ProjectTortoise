I don't have words to express just how much you are overestimating the intelligence of our Legislature.\r\n\r\nIt was only 10 years ago that they changed the marriage law so that you could no longer marry a 14 year old girl with just consent of her parents and without the consent of the girl.  You are welcome to imagine how popular that made our state with men who wanted a legal way to rape an early teen girl, and had the cash to pay off her parents for the priviledge.\r\n\r\nOh, and don't forget that this is a state that actually enforces their sodomy laws.  There is in fact a guy in jail with a 20 year sentence for going down on his wife.\r\n\r\nI live here and I still don't know what the fuck is so wrong with the prosecutors that they would even push to punish a couple of kids for this, while the only time they ever go after the polygamists who regularly sexually abuse children is when something particularly nasty forces them to because of public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe very idea that these twerps can deduce the consequences of their actions is utter foolishness.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u021","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165532793,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":34,"ups":34,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14817-57eb7fc7-9cff-472d-9f17-9d6aa6d923a7-1566236762"}

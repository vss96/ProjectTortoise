For example, all the info for one user's gmail account is atomic. That makes it easy to say \"Server X currently owns the data for bob, server Y has the data for jim and kelly.\" \r\n\r\nData for web searches are even easier, as each web page is basically atomic and read-only. And if some servers are out of date, who cares? They will just get picked up in the next sweep.\r\n\r\nThe data for my company doesn't work that way. I'm processing live financial transactions, where a delay of 15 minutes can result in large fines. My data has to 100% accurate and reasonably up to date, where reasonably may be a few minutes to a day depending on the data. And changes to one record may have repercussions to hundreds of accounts. Almost nothing is isolated, and it sucks.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that most database-backed web sites are more like mine than like googles.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3829-36a9e178-090d-45a4-8a9f-ee65e83780d9-1566236759"}

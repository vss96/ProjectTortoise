How about toxic chemicals other than cigarette smoke?  What if instead I randomly fired shots into a crowd, is that OK?  Where is the line on how much damage I am allowed to do to everyone around me before it's no longer OK according to the thinking of smokers?\r\n\r\nI'll be honest about my position.  I think that once you've passed the line from \"bad smelling\" to \"actually hurting people\" you've committed assault and should be treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis means that I think that if you smoke anywhere near someone with asthma or other sensitivity to cigarette smoke you should be sent to prison.\r\n\r\nI'm all for gun rights, so I'd be hypocritical to say that tobacco should be illegal.  I think, however, that it should be treated like other things which can hurt people.  Thus, like guns and knives it's fine to own them and use them, but if you hurt another human using them you should be in trouble.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ubmh","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165779438,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20568-23600a42-0dc3-4b86-bd9a-cc884c1f36f7-1566236765"}

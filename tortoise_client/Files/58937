I would assume this is done by others with front page stories they don't want overtaken.  \r\n\r\nI have even seen this done on a very popular submission with 30 upvotes almost immediately.  The ratio of up to down was 30 / 5.  Each time it got upvoted to the front page after that it would get 2 or 3 negatives immediately.  This would be followed by several up votes in a row then 2 or 3 negatives again.  As soon as the story was bumped from the front page the negatives quit coming.  \r\n\r\nI wish Reddit would add names of those who voted by the history to make this gaming 100% transparent so users here could do what they are good at and downmod the offenders into oblivion.\r\n\r\nOne can only wish.\r\n\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808404,"gilded":0,"id":"cul9d","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uk8y","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Simply23","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25113-d7ee63a0-d85f-4b09-947d-d6e4d9c64ddb-1566236767"}

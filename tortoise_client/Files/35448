This is so controversial that I don't\r\n&gt; &gt; even know where to begin. Maybe the refactoring tool will be able to\r\n&gt; &gt; help and can automatically convert imports using old locations to\r\n&gt; &gt; imports using new locations? Then if the new locations are also made\r\n&gt; &gt; available in Python 2.6, we'd even have an upgrade path. Who wants to\r\n&gt; &gt; help out here? There's a huge amount of work and if it is left to me\r\n&gt; &gt; it won't get done.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; I'm afraid that this problem just needs a decision: How do you (Guido, not\r\n&gt; python-3000) want to organize the standard library?  Maybe you already made\r\n&gt; that decision and it was in one of the threads I never read -- if so, sorry\r\n&gt; :P\r\n&gt; Anyway, there's lots to be said for all approaches to organizing the\r\n&gt; standard library, so I think you should just decide between java-like\r\n&gt; (deeply structured), the current (unstructured, but with modules renamed to\r\n&gt; fit styleguide, possibly with a 'stdlib' package covering all) or inbetween.\r\n&gt; I favour second option without package; the other two options will no doubt\r\n&gt; generate much discussion about how deep the structure should be and what\r\n&gt; categories it should cover. I'd rather spend time renaming modules than\r\n&gt; archiving threads :-)\r\n\r\nOk, so be it. Let this be a pronouncement -- the only stdlib reorg\r\nwe're doing will be (a) deleting silly old stuff; (b) rename modules\r\nthat don't conform to the current module/package naming convention,\r\nlike StringIO, cPickle or UserDict.\r\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167307118,"score":13,"ups":13,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54725-a1517759-e441-44ba-8750-a096e60b30ea-1566236779"}

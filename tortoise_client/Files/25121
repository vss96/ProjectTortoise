Mr Tweek, so simple, even advertized his \"simpler\" coffee from a \"simpler\" time.  The corporation railroaded into town, rode out a brief confrontation, and won.  In South Park as in other towns.\r\n\r\nThe gnomes illustrate that Harbucks knows what \"Step 2\" actually is.  Step 2 is railroading into town with lots of money and a corporate infrastructure.  Unstoppable.\r\n\r\nThe overall point is that there was nothing Mr Tweek could have done to stop Harbucks.  Not loyalty to community, not advertizing, not political maneuvers.  When the big corporation rolls into town, you might as well just give up and not come off looking like a buffoon next to a well oiled machine.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry was indeed better than the machine, but the machine was unstoppable.\r\n\r\nBut where are all these machines--both physical and corporate--taking the country?  Sometimes the future looks dystopian.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tib7","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6576-b16ad9d2-d0b4-455b-8d3c-617cf317ecc9-1566236760"}

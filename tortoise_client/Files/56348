{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ud3o","controversiality":1,"body":"* I never said otherwise.  However, no where in LDS scripture does it claim that Elohim has multiple wives.  If it does, please provide a reference.  Also, the phrase \"hundreds\" is never used with connection to the number of wives that any LDS priesthood holder should have.  Again, please provide a reference to LDS scripture.\r\n* Yes it is.  I clearly stated that this is the case.  Yet the term Gods in Abraham is not the same as what was in the film.  The term Gods in the Book of Abraham refers to Jesus and other pre-mortal spirits destined to come to earth.  They are not understood to be on the same level of existence as Elohim.  How could they?  They're his children.  And yes, Mormons believe they too will be Gods.  I never suggested otherwise.\r\n* Inspired and \"official doctrine\" are two very different things.  See below.\r\n* But he was not Adam and that's clear in several references in and out of the temple.  Besides the temple ceremony is completely allegorical.  Anyone who suggests its supposed to be a literal history doesn't understand it in the least.\r\n* See below\r\n* See below\r\n* That's one interpretation of that scripture, but I have _never_ heard that claimed in any LDS church service, manual, or by any instructor.  The LDS church believes that all Mormons are the seed of Abraham.  Is that literal?  No and no one believes it.  They believe they are \"adopted\" into the house of Israel upon baptism.  Big difference.  I believe the scriptures referred to there have a similar allegorical or spiritual meaning.\r\n* Yes.  I said in my earlier post that he will help, but so will other prophets.  The idea is that God delegates and you'll have levels of judges.  But most believe that God and Christ will still be personally involved at some point.\r\n\r\nDo my homework.  Okay, look I was raised Mormon, went on a mission, my father was a bishop and in the stake presidency.  I know Mormon theology better than just about anyone you'll ever meet and I can see where you got each point listed.  To give a detailed explanation of that film is not something that would reasonably fit in a reddit comment box, so forgive me if I didn't explain every detail to your satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHowever, the issue you appear to be having and what many other Mormon critics have, not secular Mormon critics but Christian Mormon critics, is that they want to take every word some old LDS leader said and treat it literally and as gospel.  It's like including every stray writing of every monk as Catholic cannon.  Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you but Mormons today don't believe in it like that.  You can tell them they should but they'll just keep on living their religion as they like.\r\n\r\nMormon theology is slippery because it evolves.  The only things nailed down are what's in the 4 standard scriptures.  Everything else can be changed or adjusted by later leaders.  That's the whole idea of having living prophets is so they can further clarify and give revelation.  So anything a leader says today trumps someone from before.  Moreover, it's well understood that leaders have their own opinions and not everything they say should be taken as gospel.  Determining what should and shouldn't be taken as official is tricky, even for lifelong Mormons.  Consequently, the current set of leaders are particularly aware of the tendency for Mormons to attach themselves to every word they say, so they're much more careful about saying anything that might be controversial.  Personally I think this has made the church much more bland, but oh well.\r\n\r\nSo you can claim Mormons believe crazy things (well, they do) and you can find references in books that some individual pre-1900 Mormon preacher said something but if 99% of modern Mormons don't believe in it (let alone have heard of it) then can you really say that Mormons believe it?  That just doesn't seem like an honest or realistic description to me.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165849594,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cufon","id":"cuftr","author_flair_text":null,"author":"farra","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808300,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22347-eac5c295-2f52-4350-94cc-913e9c1b9712-1566236766"}

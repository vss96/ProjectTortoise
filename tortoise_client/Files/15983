It's insecurity.  Marginally smart people are insecure about people who are smarter than them.  They turn out marginal products.\r\n\r\nHighly intelligent people aren't threatened by other highly intelligent people for numerous reasons.  One is that geniuses realize that doing anything hard takes hard work, and hard work is the determining factor.  Being smart doesn't make things magically appear, and being smart is useful only insofar as you put it *to use*.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that no matter how smart someone else is, it doesn't make you any less smart.  In fact, being around other smart people is *stimulating*, and being exposed to new ideas creates new connections in your own brain, making you *smarter*.  \r\n\r\nAlso, having an ego is not about thinking other people are inferior, but that what you bring to the table is worthwhile no matter who else is there.  It is very unlikely that two people's abilities overlap precisely, meaning smart people are complementary.  \r\n\r\nI may be the best at skill X, but I still need people who are good at Y and Z.  That's what's so great about open source/free software; I can get very good implementations of large parts of the solution, and maybe I have an idea to tweak a couple of things, but they had ideas about how to do the 100 other things that I didn't.  No matter how good I am at skill X, a beginner may ask a question that makes me realize something new.  \r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ttmi","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807950,"author":"lemmikins","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctwy6","id":"ctx3n","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12849-d38c2dc6-d11d-4f82-903d-18d13c1a5434-1566236762"}

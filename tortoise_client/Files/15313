{"body":"The problem is that it completely ignores the intent of the person who donated the clothing. The clothing was given freely with the presumption that a poor person would be receiving it for free.\r\n\r\nSo instead of getting free clothes, they get slightly cheaper clothes and no local clothing industry because they **can't compete against a merchant that got their product at negligible cost**. For a developing country with a large population of unskilled and moderately skilled workers, losing an industry like clothing manufacture may greatly outweigh the benefit of slightly cheaper clothing.\r\n\r\nI realize there are costs associated with transporting and distributing the clothes, but most charities accepting clothing donations *do* get monetary donations as well. Goodwill and the Salvation Army seem to have plenty of money to build stores and collection centers all over the place, after all. Even if a pair of jeans were sold at the after-transport price of $1.30/pair, the benefits might outweigh the costs.\r\n\r\nWhat annoys me is the suggestion that this is just normal competition and the local industry is just inefficient and therefore should die. Company A is manufacturing something and selling it, Company B is importing something that was acquired at zero cost and then selling it at slightly less. They're given an unfair competitive advantage because their product was given for free by people who assumed it would be given for free to poor people.\r\n\r\nWould you say the same thing if canned goods you donated to a food bank were ending up being sold in Africa for prices just cheap enough to kill off the local industry?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vo79","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1166815621,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_cvr1e","id":"cvrzb","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809215,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45969-09c89c41-1433-4023-ac3a-863aec229977-1566236775"}

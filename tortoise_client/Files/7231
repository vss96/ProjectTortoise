But just because they are not very cuddly doesn't mean they deserve to have surgery performed without anaesthesia, do they? A Australian man is removing the venom glands from snakes so he can handle them safely. (Why not simply refrain from handling them in the first place?) He does it without assistance from a veterinarian, with no other medication than cooling them in the fridge. That only means they can not move, not that they can not feel. There are laws to prevent such cruelty to animals in most modern Western societies but apparently this is ok in Australia because the authorities seem to allow it. This page details the whole affair and hopes to have it stopped.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165429656,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11959-197899fc-710e-49e3-a0df-5d7238f0729b-1566236761"}

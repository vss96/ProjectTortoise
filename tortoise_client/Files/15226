The conventional wisdom is that a weak dollar would hurt German exports to the US, however the author notes that that at this point only about 10% of Germany's exports go to the US.  Consider that there are lots of Chinese able to buy that Mercedes now so while some small part of their market will be impacted, other new markets are developing.\r\n\r\nAlso, since Oil is (currently still) priced in US$ that helps Europe get lower energy prices based on the exchange rate.  I think on balance, there will be some lost exports to the US, but it could be counterbalanced by cheaper energy and new markets for German (and other European) goods.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808432,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cumr6","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cumjf","author":"UncleOxidant","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25833-98d7c2ab-30af-47d6-b573-3008fb891456-1566236767"}

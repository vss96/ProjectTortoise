{"controversiality":0,"body":"This guy was one of the implementors of the TI Explorer Lisp machine, so he's certainly not full of shit. He uses terms like 'weak typing' because he has to dumb down his message in order to reach Java/C# programmers. It appears that what he wants is a Lisp which runs on the JVM or CLR. Such projects exist, however are not mature (eg, see Armed Bear Common Lisp for the JVM). Personally I don't see why one would want to use the JVM, but obviously some people do. His other suggestion that Lisp should drop the number tower and use machine arithmetic types (ints, floats) is outrageous, though. Proper support for bignums/rationals/complex numbers is a very useful thing to have, and it is something Ruby and Python have not copied yet. Maybe he really wants Ocaml or Haskell instead.","link_id":"t3_tdba","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165124320,"score":8,"ups":8,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctde5","id":"ctf4m","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807613,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4528-2eb19c74-d0ff-4fef-9053-f5bf0d76119a-1566236759"}

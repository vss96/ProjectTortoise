Religious faith is especially problematic because it *does* demand action, and also demands special treatment (\"it's my religion - shut up\").\r\n\r\nBut 70%+ of the UK population call themselves Christian. A vocal minority of them want to teach Creationism and prosecute blasphemy, but for many of them it just means a warm, fuzzy belief that dead kittens and relatives still exist, and that someone is listening to them when they want to vent. This probably indicates a lack of intellectual rigour on their part, but it's pretty benign as the rich spectrum of human irrationality goes. I'd rather address more poisonous irrationalities - nationalism or climate change scepticism, or fundamentalist Christianity and militant Islam - first.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v6h2","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808843,"author":"lessofthat","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv8nj","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv8ku","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36200-b6136dbc-a87f-4bef-a6cc-f30c12afdaa1-1566236772"}

(See below to find out what they do. Note that you have to press Play twice to get through LCM.) But the real cool stuff comes after the tests finish. On a 3G iPod, you can press buttons to make noises come out of the built-in speaker. Press Previous to hear the wheel's clicking sound, Menu and Select to get two different long beeps, and Next for an effect that sounds a little like a Star Wars blaster. You can have a lot of fun walking around with your iPod, pressing buttons and staring intently at the screen as if you were doing something serious. The clicking sound makes a great fake radiation detector. Press Play to return to the Diagnostics menu.","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39595-20af439f-8fb8-42f3-bec6-660c29fb9fc5-1566236773"}

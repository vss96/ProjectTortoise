However for obvious production and logistic reasons that help was very small in the most critical first 6 months after German invasion of Russia. So Russia stopped Nazi advance pretty much on its own. Besides Russians had plenty of room to retreat, they could surrender Moscow like they did 150 years before that to France and retreat hundreds of miles to the east. So it was only a matter of time for them to defeat Germany. Lend-Lease greatly sped up that day, the war was shortened by many years and millions of lives were saved, but I doubt Lend-Lease help was critical.\r\n\r\nJust to illustrate exponential nature of help: during the first three years up to may 1944 USA delivered about 200,000 automobiles to Soviet Union, and during the last year (may 1944 - aug 1945) USA delivered about the same number of automobiles. So most automobiles were delivered when Germany was already doomed.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808204,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cuamz","parent_id":"t1_cu992","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19612-d0dcb09d-c744-4f2f-8dc6-cd15304a37cb-1566236764"}

Things are arranged into modules, but the modules aren't arranged into any sort of a hierarchy to help you find things, and the naming scheme for modules seems somewhat haphazard. Some modules are named with CamelCase, some with all lowercase (mimetools vs. MimeWriter vs. mimify), many are abbreviated (quick, what's in the \"quopri\" module? How about \"cgitb\"?), some not, some have 'lib' on the end of them, some don't, and so on.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of good functionality there, but it's not arranged very nicely.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w820","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54511-5c02bf53-f358-4d68-8a1b-de37fe3824d4-1566236779"}

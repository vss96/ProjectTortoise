It has a small population of developers and is relatively recent. Python on the other hand has a large (in comparison to ruby) user base, many large proven deployed projects, and many web frameworks. I am not sure that I would rush to emulate the ruby worlds view of how many web frameworks is right.\r\n\r\nThe last time I checked competition was generally thought of as a good thing, spurring innovation, and the 'central planning &amp; one implementation school' had died a death.\r\n\r\nIt beats the hell out of me why only having one real web framework is seen as one of rubys advantage. To me it says writing web frameworks in ruby is either insanely hard, or simply unwanted. Surely if it was easy , or significant demand existed, there would be many of them.\r\n\r\nOnly one web framework looks like a lack of experimentation and original thought to me.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808126,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cu6gi","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu697","author":"seanodonnell","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17259-a412c6b4-c386-420a-841d-c04f668f6807-1566236763"}

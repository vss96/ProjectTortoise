I know what I'd pick.\r\n\r\nI'd take issue with the +1. You generally already have that class around.\r\n\r\nI can't get over how often people thing this is a numbers thing. You think it's about the number of cases, someone else thinks it's about the number of times you have to switch. It's not. If you are branching on what is really a type, you really should use polymorphism of some kind. If you are branching on a value, than a lookup table or a switch is undoubtedly most appropriate.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u0r5","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808065,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"xcbsmith","parent_id":"t1_cu2x7","id":"cu39u","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15623-747d3985-6496-4de9-a791-849421c2f1d2-1566236763"}

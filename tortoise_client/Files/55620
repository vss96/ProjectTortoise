The problem with a purely punitive penal system is that it traumatises people to the extent that they are unlikely to be able to rejoin society -- prisons in many cases serve as academies of crime.  Then the penal system has the responsibility of holding onto those criminals it has rendered unfit for reintegration, and interning them for the long term (see the US's anomalous -- among democracies -- rate of incarceration).\r\n\r\nOf course, this is a boon for the privatized prison industry, since it keeps the fedbucks rolling in.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ubo5","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165832586,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21971-c6be3de7-eb71-4d72-a72f-11ffbeaa8b49-1566236766"}

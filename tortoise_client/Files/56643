Being able to read a kanji and being able to write it are very different things, that's all. I would say that most adult Japanese people who finished high school can read a newspaper and get enough meaning out of it without using a dictionary too much. But they probably couldn't write more than half the kanji without checking if they were right or not. Moreso than English, I think that the gap between being able to read and write is large. In English, if you know the pronunciation of a word, you can usually make a reasonable attempt at spelling it. But in Japanese, its no help at all most of the time. On top of that, there are many kanji with the same pronunciation, any of which could reasonably be used, so guessing can be really tricky. \r\n\r\nAs for the subway station, especially things like faraway place names are all highly irregular words and often only locals can read them properly.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vzzg","subreddit":"science","ups":4,"score":4,"created_utc":1167113885,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50763-ab349056-f9aa-407d-86cd-cab450d5341f-1566236778"}

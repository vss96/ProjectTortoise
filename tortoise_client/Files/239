In other words, you dont really *see* the remote going into his head, but camera trickery makes you think that you do.\r\n\r\n2) The necessary velocity of an object the size of a remote to actually puncture and embed itself inside of someone's skull is beyond that which any human throw could possibly produce.\r\n\r\n3) A blunt object hitting your head will not pierce it, it will (with sufficient force) crack your skull and cave it in a bit, but its not going to embed itself like that.\r\n\r\n4) *IF* by some miracle of nature the guy who threw the remote was strong enough to throw it such that it would pierce a skull like that, it would absolutely *not* just stick half way out of the head. The structure of the head is such that beyond the skull is brain matter, which is very soft, and the remote would certainly go *all* the way into the head.\r\n\r\nOk, 'nuff said.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166730794,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43996-a0de02d1-9505-4f66-bc98-7aedcd628180-1566236774"}

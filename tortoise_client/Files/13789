Although it reminded me of a phrase, whose origin I can't remember: \"Managing Up\". Obviously this is not always possible, and it sounds like this was one case where it was hard, but I still see it as a part of the job of a technical lead type role to guide management to the right decision.\r\n\r\nObviously, if you have to do this too often, you'll get pissed off, and maybe should find somewhere else to work, but until then, it's part of your job. Of course, if he had already laid out a nice table, detailing the effort and expected performance of the solutions, and management still said \"Fire bad. Neural Networks good.\" then he'd done all he could. (And could be happy he got to do two cool projects, and get well paid).","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807576,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctd7d","parent_id":"t3_ta5x","author_flair_text":null,"author":"jbstjohn","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3600-3e79a146-22dc-48b5-af16-f170c26c9328-1566236759"}

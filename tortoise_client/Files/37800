I was that guy. And I was sure that those people on the other side of the political spectrum were trying to control my life. And then I went to Boulder and got rid of my Birkenstocks immediately, because everyone else had them and I realized that these people over here want to control my life too. I guess that defines my political philosophy. If anybody’s telling me what I should do, then you’ve got to really convince me that it’s worth doing.\r\n\r\nThis meets my definition of a libertarian.\r\n\r\nAlso I don't quite understand how he can think Mormonism is cool while Scientology is totally bunk if he acknowledges both are based on \"complete bullshit\".  The only differences he sites are that Scientologists try to convert others to their beliefs and that Mormons are somehow \"nicer\".  From personal experience I've met some real asshole Mormons (as you'd find with any group) and I know they are one of the biggest on \"spreading the good word\" amongst the Christian sects.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807819,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctq3l","parent_id":"t3_tpok","author_flair_text":null,"author":"thevalarauk","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9428-8c2ef355-0712-420f-b2cb-9cbed3fd8dcd-1566236761"}

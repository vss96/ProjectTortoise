I mean, what is more horrible, the sentence \"If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged (...) he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her\" or the lame picture of a thug assaulting a woman in a wedding dress? I'd go for the sentence. Or perhaps it was about the adjective \"funny\"? Well, this text is obsolete and no one advocates its litteral application (contrarily to equally horrifying surates of the Koran) and there is an absurd, grotesque feel to it, so yeah, I find it funny, in the same way that the \"brick testament\" makes me giggle. Anyway, - I probably have a peculiar sense of humour.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t031","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2545-3db548e0-9cc5-4e4e-920c-f3c4160392f7-1566236758"}

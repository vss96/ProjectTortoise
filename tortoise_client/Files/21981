It's hard to stab somebody with a pencil and not have anybody know who did it.\r\n\r\nNitpick nitpick: The most notable variable in muzzle energy by a long shot is muzzle velocity, not mass.  Talking about a typical pellet gun, the variation in mass, regardless of style or brand of pellet, is almost insignificant next to muzzle velocity.  Same goes for most guns in general.  Why do you think that, despite the obviously huge size of a .50 bullet, most .50 manufacturers focus all their graphs and advertising on muzzle velocity?  The same reason that nobody needs to know the momentum when they hear about a Ford F-150 going 60mph and mowing down grandma in the crosswalk.  Sure, mass\\*velocity is the technically correct way to discuss it, but realistically, if you're familiar with Ford F-150s, grandmas, and 60mph, you can get a pretty good idea in your head without having to futz around with a calculator.","controversiality":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166218761,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cuymb","edited":false,"id":"cuyqt","author":"oditogre","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808655,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31467-47addfb7-c6c6-4ff1-aee0-e530a8941a64-1566236770"}

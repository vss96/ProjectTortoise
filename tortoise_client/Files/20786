I’m beginning to think that impromptu face to face conversations/brainstorms with white boards, pen and paper flying, wild gesticulation, and general excitement are the moments that really fuel inspired work. I’ve never really been able to recreate those moments with phone, IM, or virtual office type applications.\r\n\r\nYou might think, \"what about Linux?\"  It's \"remote development\", but almost all the main players actually *go to work in an office* with peers.  So, the question should really be rephrased to refer to \"working from home\", because working from a real office with other people, and collaborating remotely with other people who are also in real offices, seems to work pretty well.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to recall how it was I used to be such a good at-home worker, and now that I think about it, it was before I got broadband!  You don't fuck around on the Net as much on dial-up.\r\n","link_id":"t3_uvcf","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29944-dd6c87cf-62e0-4cd0-9b12-7e341f5a8eb4-1566236769"}

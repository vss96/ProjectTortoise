I will say that in comparison, if you take one action and apply it to both a human and an animal, then the application in my mind to the human is always worst. Hopefully that's able to qualify my view of it.\r\n\r\nNo, I know that my LDL levels are perfectly fine, it's only my HDL. I've had discussions with my doctor over it.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental contaminants are in all food these days. Your body can handle the levels present in them.\r\n\r\n\"Due to being accustomed to living an unexamined existence\" is an ad hominem. I stand by my previous interpretation.\r\n\r\nYour constitution, which may or may not be the same as mine (Canadian), is different from others. It is a document that your society has agreed on. Different societies agree on different things. Would you say the \"Right to Life\" is inalienable? Why then does Capital Punishment exist? Society can take away rights just as it can grant them. Similarly convicts are not awarded the right to freedom. I didn't say government, I said society.\r\n\r\nWhere in your legal statutes does it say animals have rights? *Protection under law doesn't imply individual rights.* It's well defined legal theory. Animal cruelty statues are not based on rights.\r\n\r\nI was saying philosophical theory hasn't been resolved. There is a great difference between evolving scientific theory and evolving philosophical theory.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166399059,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34710-24ab42a7-feb6-408f-8aaf-c4affe6d8089-1566236771"}

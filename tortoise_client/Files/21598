First you say people aren't going to send their kids to good schools, then you say there will be too much demand for good schools.\r\n\r\nNot a contradiction to point out two seperate problems. The first is that parents for the most part, won't be savvy enough to actually choose based on those things that matter, or if they do, will be smart enough to tell one from another.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is, people have little or no understanding of what makes a good school. Or that there are finite resources, that once exhausted, guarantee that it's no longer possible to create more good schools, without watering all of them down.\r\n\r\n&gt;anybody with a few hundred thousand dollars of seed money will be able to set up a school. \r\n\r\nTeachers aren't planks of wood. They aren't electronic components that you can buy from Taiwan. They aren't cheap chinese plastic junk to be stamped out in an injection mold.\r\n\r\nAssuming you want good teachers, and there are no more, you have to bribe them away from another school, which then loses a good teacher.\r\n\r\n&gt;You could talk to other parents\r\n\r\nMost of them will be pretty stupid too.\r\n\r\n&gt;The market would work as advertised.\r\n\r\nNo, it would work as markets work. That's the difference. Then again, maybe you generally believe advertisements.\r\n\r\n&gt;Contrast that the the oligopoly that controls your internet connection. Here, I can choose between RoadRunner and Southwestern Bell DSL. Not much competition, and predictable, shitty results, as you observe.\r\n\r\nAh, didn't think you would catch that. The problem is, economies of scale will kick in, and these private schools will soon be big corporations. Sorta like those HMOs that tell your doctor it costs too much to give you proper treatment. Gatto himself believes in small schools, with only a couple hundred students at most. But corporatizing, privatizing all these school systems will create only super schools. Some accountant will decide that it costs less to bus your kid 2 hours away to one with 5000 kids than it would to build two buildings. And all the other accountants at all the other school corporations will come to the same conclusion (not that there will be so many competing ones).\r\n\r\nBut go on being deluded, your choice of democrats (er, I mean school vouchers) is so much better than the republicans (er, I mean state-sponsored education).","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166994805,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48993-fc0d1152-ae15-4d8f-9144-1283174d8b6c-1566236777"}

The fact that it's the basis for the most common religions doesn't mean religion is at fault.  It means that those religions are at fault.\r\n\r\nHowever, even these religions aren't the root of all evil on this planet.  They were just the method used by people trying to manipulate others.\r\n\r\nThe root of all evil is probably the urge to believe that what you \"know\" is absolutely right, and that any means necessary to make others agree is acceptable.  (not you specifically, that is)\r\n\r\nI guess that boils down to the urge to spread one's belief, whatever it happens to be, whether it's political, religious, or even food related.\r\n\r\nIt probably evolves out of a need for acceptance and/or self-assurance.  If others agree with you on it, you get positive feedback.\r\n\r\nThis could also explain the urge to do violence on those that disagree with you. (not you specifically)  Hearing someone disagree with your viewpoint, it would come across as negative feedback regardless of how it was stated.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to disagree. ;)\r\n\r\nThe question that arises is...where did this urge evolve from?  Is it leftover from when we were living in tribes, and acceptance meant better survival?","link_id":"t3_v6h2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166475690,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36745-4dc5db58-da34-4161-9e42-99bab8e80c8a-1566236772"}

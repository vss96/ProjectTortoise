The scheme:  make supply scarce so that the supply-demand curve is skewed and they can set a very high price.  \r\n\r\nIt seemed to be working well at first ... scalpers camped out for three nights outside of stores.  The initial prices on ebay were 4-5 times retail.  \r\n\r\nBut within two or three days after release of the PS3, prices on ebay fell to 2-times retail.  Then by Christmas, at or below retail.  \r\n\r\nThere is some kind of sweet justice in this.  The people who were only iterested in profit (and not the gameplay itself) didn't get their money after all, and I'm glad. \r\n\r\nNintendo didn't get cocky, they said, \"Here's our product, we're doing as much as we can to ship as much product as we can to meet demand.  We're charging a fair price from day one, and not overpricing in the beginning to sqeeze more profit from the first wave of buyers.\"  A classy, honest company beat a scheming, greedy company.  This time.  So far.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809442,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w37e","id":"cw3zc","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52165-23c44512-0794-4f77-a38a-b46f96602dde-1566236778"}

I then went on to write and publish commercial video games for the 8 bit home computers, Atari ST and Amiga, again in C and assembler and ran on the bare metal, no DirectX or Windows for me. \r\n\r\nTodays computers are like lego kits in comparison but if someone wants to customize a box, it's cool. 5 years ago, custom building was cheaper than buying (ask me how I know). Today thats not true. So, a little of what you're saying is already at work, custom is going to cost more now and even more moving forward.\r\n\r\nThe general person is not safe to hold their data at home. Me, I use online quickbooks for my company and carbonite for personal backup and I forget about it, no backup worries, leave it to the staff at Intuit and carbonite.\r\n\r\nMy mum has the same problem, lots of digital photos, documents, movies etc and for her, backing them up is a chore.

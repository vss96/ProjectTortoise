At least I'm assuming that anyone starving to death wouldn't be reading.\r\n\r\nSo the only thing left is social status. The guys who walk up and down baseball stadiums selling beer make over 100K a year if they have good hustle, working only 100 days a year. (According to Aramark who is the food contractor at most of these stadiums)\r\n\r\nThe thing is though, selling hotdogs and making 100k a year isn't going to get you laid, whereas being a coder making 60k a year will. Wait, bad example. But you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nAnd as technology exponentiates, physical goods will become close to worthless and the ONLY thing that will matter is social status. I'm not claiming we're really going to hit the singularity in 2040, but when you consider the average middle class American can afford the stuff that only the super rich could afford 50 years ago and then the rate of change is going to be 200x faster this century than the last...\r\n\r\nThe only possible conclusion one can come to is that one should be going after social status and not money.\r\n\r\nGRANTED, college is fake social status, and going to college for the degree is essentially the equivalent of paying for friends. But that is a whole separate issue.","score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165603691,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cu5f3","parent_id":"t3_u476","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Alex3917","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808106,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16639-4aa500f1-464b-4533-b705-b759c3e15d0c-1566236763"}

Transfat is a SBD killer, silent but deadly.  You can smell smoke, you can avoid smoke, and second hand smoke is no where near as provenly bad for you as unceccessary and 'cheap' transfat.  And it's slipped to you on the down-low.\r\n\r\nI also am happy about the requirement that organizations that provide caloric content *must* do so right on the menu.  McDonalds, KFC, BK, Wendy's, etc.  Either they stop providing caloric content(total PR faux paus) or they will now be required to list their 600Kc per McFish-w-Cheese right next to the price.  Sweet.  Dude, have you even been to a McDonalds lately?  God, it's awful, nasty, procesed, pre-fab, factory churned out, high-fat, high-calorie, nastiness incarnate!  Oh, and waaaay too may carbs per meal...  Did they think that some dubiously yoghurt like secretion plus some walnuts, grapes, and apples is gonna offset this?  Shit, it even makes it worse!  Nothing but sugars and fats.\r\n\r\n-dr\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ua13","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808192,"author":"rebel","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ua13","id":"cua1y","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19274-8e2244e2-761d-429f-aca3-e09392d4c7b1-1566236764"}

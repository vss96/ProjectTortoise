I had a short-lived fancy that I would set myself up as an importer once I returned to the states... but it was, of course, the alcohol talking ;]\r\n\r\n[Estonian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language) is held as one of the harder languages in the world to learn (along with its sibling Finnish and ancestor Hungarian). But, like Finland, Estonia is really starting to shine once out from under the Soviet anchorweight. My guess is that making language non optional for citizenship produces a citizen that is committed to making the most out of that investment of time and effort.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166476507,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_v7fq","id":"cv9qr","edited":false,"author":"sblinn","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808864,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36773-e7afb62e-5924-4729-9546-0da41ebca3da-1566236772"}

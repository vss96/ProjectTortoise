Get out of here you clown!\r\n\r\nConsidering how complicated an OS is and, if they were under perssure and rushing, MS workers were unable to check everything that was coming over from Spider I'm completely unsurprised that this happened.  Heck, I don't see you complaining about \"Hot Coffee\" that was left in GTA.","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37680-dd6f8f13-8348-4548-92f4-951f19af8d11-1566236772"}

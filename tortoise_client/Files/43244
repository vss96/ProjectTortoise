However, the fact that so many people choose to go to college anyway indicates that there must be something else that college gives you that is worth more than the difference in what you're going to make.\r\n\r\nThe social accomplishment of completing college is a big part of the package for many who go.  For others, college is also where they find their spouses, many of their lifelong friends, find their passion, and grow up.  If you add all these things together, they might be worth the $70k price tag to some folks.\r\n\r\n(Also, one can go to college for much less than $70k in-state in most states.)\r\n\r\nWhat was my reason, personally?  I grateful that I added enough to my personal capital that his calculations are moot for me; I will easily make back the difference in the first ten years.  But social pressure and failure to understand the alternatives also made a big impact on my decision.  I would do it again, but if I had known all this beforehand and hadn't known the outcomes, I would have thought a bit more before I made the leap.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u476","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16187-3f2ca23b-7d3c-434e-8a92-0260d3f2f42d-1566236763"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Can Erlang call blocking C functions directly from Erlang processes?  (Not via erl_interface, that communicates over socket.)  I'm curious how they get it to work internally - do they spawn an OS thread to handle all FFI requests, and then lock the message queue every time an Erlang process calls a foreign thread?\r\n\r\nIf it can't, then the article's a little misleading, because Erlang would suffer all the drawbacks of Twisted in integrating with C libraries.  And integrating with Erlang libraries is an uninteresting case, because it takes you back to the \"rewrite the library\" hassle.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t7eb","subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1164991988,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ct8tm","parent_id":"t3_t7eb","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807494,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1453-736d02c3-ac26-471d-a532-b4298e93faf2-1566236758"}

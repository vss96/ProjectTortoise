I don't want a plumber I pay to be less trained, but if an invention made the need for my hiring a plumber obsolete, well, great! I just saved $400 installing the water heater myself.\r\n\r\nSpreadsheets made a great deal of programming accessible to a lot of people. Is that dangerous? On occasion. Desirable? Absolutely. Do I let the guy with the spreadsheet build my bridge? Not yet. Do I let him do his own financial planning? Of course!\r\n\r\nThe idea of \"programming as a semiskilled task, practiced by people with a few months' training\" is paradise.\r\n\r\nArchitecture of buildings and engineering of bridges and trains is practiced by a few because the materials we use are weak.\r\n\r\nIf 200 years from now the average Joe could build his own car and safely drive it over his own home built 60ft bridge would that be so bad? Seems unlikely and all, but B talks like the abilities to create things are inherently the birthright of a gifted few.\r\n","link_id":"t3_u5pe","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165693436,"score":7,"ups":7,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18862-52affc87-7855-420a-b472-439e7c74091f-1566236764"}

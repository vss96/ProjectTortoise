And even so, it's only illegal if it is lethal. And *even* if we were to consider mantrapping relevant here, tort law seems to exempt lethal \"mantrapping\" in [circumstances](http://www.4lawschool.com/torts/kat.shtml) like those of a rape victim and assailant. \r\n\r\nSo, in short, no this would not qualify as \"mantrapping.\"","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165846856,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cufnu","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuecf","author_flair_text":null,"author":"frankieist","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808298,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22277-880f019e-37db-470f-9e46-0bb7ea6daf22-1566236766"}

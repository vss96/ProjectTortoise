If visual studio existed for OS X, however, I would throw away my copies of windows and stomp on my linux discs, and never use any other operating system again. I would also do this if Ruby or Python had a GUI development system on par with visual studio and suitable opengl support for games (note that python does have the latter).","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vs61","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809246,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvtkt","parent_id":"t1_cvtd8","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46878-6fbd4617-e7c4-48c7-b1d4-d7cc05c23792-1566236775"}

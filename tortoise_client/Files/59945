If every politician cuts spending, it's good for everyone because the economy recovers.  But if you cut spending and other politicians don't, all that happens is that voters vote you out because they don't want to pay so much taxes and not get anything.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is even assuming that politicians want to cut spending and are fighting the entitlement attitude of their electorate.  I believe, however, that politicians are even more in favor of government spending than most.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is how the current situation came about.  Things are going to keep going in the same direction unless something drastic happens to shock people into changing their behavior.  Unfortunately, they may misdiagnose (again!) the cause of this mess, and make things far worse.","retrieved_on":1473808986,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cve4k","id":"cvg3z","author_flair_text":null,"author":"asokoloski","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40077-850af2ae-aebf-42fc-9591-37e5ee7085bd-1566236773"}

In section 1 of the CoJ (Meredith's translation) he says \"the judgement of taste ... cannot be other than subjective.\" He goes on to say in section 6 that someone who judges a work of art in a disinterested way (e.g. someone who is not an enemy of the artist) will tend to feel that other people should share his opinion.  \r\n\r\nThat's the opposite of what I'm saying.  I'm claiming that in the very narrow sense of pleasing humans, beauty actually is a property of the object, in the same way that fitting into a two-prong socket is a property of a plug.\r\n","created_utc":1165868670,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":11,"ups":11,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23106-2d5f0572-d0c4-44a2-8eb6-75c06c2e6981-1566236766"}

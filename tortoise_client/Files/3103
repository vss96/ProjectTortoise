Many kids in food service are subject to that kowtowing, no-dignity position where they cannot freely stick up for themselves when a customer is truly out of line. But often, because they're kids and the pay is low and there are lots of other similar jobs available, they can rapidly get a case of the farkits. I've been there--waiting on some unruly drunks at 2AM in a Denny's. When I'd put up with enough crap, I just dropped the bill on the table and left 'em alone. They'd try to get me to come over for refills or some other BS and I'd just blow 'em off. Didn't care about 1 tip from a group who probably wasn't going to tip anyway. Didn't care what the manager had to say about it. \r\n\r\n2. Some kids in food service don't even need an excuse to mess with your food order. I know this from experience. I have never messed with a customer's food or beverage, but I've seen it happen for revenge and for no reason at all. I actually had to stop a couple knuckleheads from making a pizza with a crust dough that they'd mixed with tobacco juice (tomacco sauce?). \r\n\r\nSo passive-aggressiveness has it's place in the dynamic. When you piss off your server or the cook, you might get a little sumth'n sumth'n on your burger that you didn't order.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808547,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_upgw","id":"cuszk","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ewokjedi","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28695-31589ba4-9217-402b-ad71-e75271a42f0d-1566236768"}

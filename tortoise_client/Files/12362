In a classical world - every effect has a cause. (Let's not go into quantum mechanics and causality in the present discussion.)\r\n\r\nSelection is caused by specific environmental conditions. Swampy conditions, for example - forced the emergence of webbed feet in aquatic birds. The mutants aquatic birds that did not have webbed feet simply did not live long enough to reproduce in that particular location, and were *selected* out. So now from the large set of possible random mutants, one now has a much smaller subset of aquatic birds with webbed feet, that kept reproducing, and formed the lovely ducks you might see in a nearby pond.\r\n\r\nBy the way this is negative selection in action. There is also positive selection, where positive traits get enhanced simply because those characteristics make that animal more prolific ! e.g. all the tall, well-built good looking guys get all the babes - just imagine if all his mates had babies...","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vx5n","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":15,"score":15,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166982959,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48707-a93ea2b4-f77f-48cd-bc1e-7055d8fae89d-1566236777"}

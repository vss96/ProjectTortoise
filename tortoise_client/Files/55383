MS insists on SPs for a long time. I don't mind their insistance on them. However, SQL injection is mostly orthogonal to the use of SPs.\r\n\r\nIn comments to the blog, when confronted with the truth (by commenter Bob Barrows), the author Lippert admits he's wrong. So he knows what he's talking about and he knows he screwed up.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of the day, there is a blog post that says a lie (SPs prevent SQL injection) and goes on about how good SPs are. (There are dozens of other articles on the web **exactly** like that, by MS-brainwashed people, I guess...)\r\n\r\nOTOH, there is **one** sentence, amongst comments, that no-one will read, that calls it what it is (\"Call stored procedures with parameters, otherwise you're just trading one injection path for another.\") And in fact, it's true for parametrized statements in general, not just SP calls.\r\n\r\nUn-fuckin'-believable!","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809011,"gilded":0,"id":"cvhdi","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vh2t","author":"Gotebe","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40666-dd939c19-4a24-4332-b5e7-dc5074388836-1566236773"}

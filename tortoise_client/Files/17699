Are you suggesting that even the most extreme case of a demonstrable sociopath should be able to voice his or her opinion.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting that pica is that kind of a person, but I do not understand how calling one out on his or her abnormal or deviant behavior is wrong.\r\n\r\nIs this a personal attack? It is personal in that I have chosen to call upon a specific entity, but attack, tot at all.\r\n\r\nIn fact, pica would well defend his positions with vigor, which is what I'm fascinated by. No, I really am. I like to think I'm not immature enough for Ad Hominem attacks.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w4i9","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167211731,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52662-a1403cce-7ad5-4cfa-a8b4-201d9d339fd4-1566236778"}

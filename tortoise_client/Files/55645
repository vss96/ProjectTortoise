It's a big tent.\r\n\r\nThere are some very smart people who program in Java.  I know of one personally, but I don't think he's tried Python or Ruby or Smalltalk or Lisp or Haskell or OCaml.\r\n\r\nIMO Python is a lot more attractive if you know C, because you DO have the option of speeding things up when needed.  I assume the same goes for Ruby.  If I didn't have that ability, Java would look more tempting than it currently does.\r\n\r\nPython has significantly more aesthetic appeal to me largely due to less typing { public static final this.that.doesSomething.goodThingIWriteIn160Columns() }, being dynamic, introspective, and not enforcing hiding (not to mention serialization for anything is a one-liner).\r\n\r\nOther people have different values which weight things in favor of Java.  It largely depends on what exactly you're using it for, and how many people you're doing it with.  Python = good for masturbation, Java = good for by-the-book, orderly orgies with protection.  Or so I've read, supposedly all the enforced strictness makes various categories of screw-ups go away.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_ulc8","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25875-f4612697-981a-4847-9c19-505f12ac2e90-1566236767"}

Above all, we value static type checking for minimizing runtime errors in applications that run in unknown environments and for wrapping legacy programs in strongly typed functions to ensure that we pass valid arguments.\r\n\r\nIt's *all* about glue, interfaces, and external systems, and making them safe and easy to plug together.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_twtt","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":11,"ups":11,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165552220,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15346-f10f2e5a-3e11-4248-9a2c-ebee01585d17-1566236762"}

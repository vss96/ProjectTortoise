I think you lack experience and foresight. You've probably been doing database reporting software for the past 20 years -- switching from COBOL to Java 6 years ago.\r\n\r\nLet me address your question, not your personal attacks.\r\n\r\nI did not, in fact, say what you just claimed. I didn't claim that the only good business decision is to use Java.\r\n\r\nYou asked me what \"risk\" means in this other thread:\r\nhttp://programming.reddit.com/info/vzw8/comments/cw1bw\r\n\r\nWhat \"a good business decision\" is a similar thing. It's a decision for which you can provide reasonable justifications which are based on the company's objectives and market realities. Often companies have local team and division objectives and global strategic  objectives.\r\n\r\nFor example, in persilian's case, his justifications would be that a) Java get the job done, b) gets the initial development work (20% of development costs) done for no more of a cost than the alternatives presented here, c) gets the subsequent maintenance work (80% of development costs) done for much less of a cost than the alternatives presented here, d) has an upwards compatibility guarantee, e) has a proven track record, f) has a very active job market, g) has a very active open source and COTS component market, h) the  components on the market are high quality, i) there are more good components for Java than for any of the alternatives presented here, j) should the company want to train its own personnel in the technology, there is a bunch of training available globally, and so on.","created_utc":1167119552,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"cw1h3","parent_id":"t1_cw1bk","author_flair_text":null,"author":"mikaelhg","retrieved_on":1473809395,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50852-a1012c29-59dd-460b-a6bf-14793253b6e4-1566236778"}

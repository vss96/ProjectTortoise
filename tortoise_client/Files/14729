Not so many years ago, they used to recommend margarine (aka hydrogenated oils) to heart patients. They also used to xray people's feet repeatedly just for kicks, and shove mercury up people's asses. \r\n\r\nRead carefully this account of the death of George Washington:\r\n\r\nhttp://xnet.kp.org/permanentejournal/spring04/time.html\r\n\r\nNote the various measures that doctors used to address his ailment. The most interesting to me is the administration of calomel (aka mercurous chloride). I'm sure shoving mercury up George Washington's ass seemed like a good idea to the doctors at the time...\r\n\r\nYes, that's right, when George Washington was sick, they shoved mercury up his ass.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but that was hundreds of years ago; medicine wasn't even a science back then...\"\r\n\r\nUm, there were lots of studies to \"prove\" that margarine was better than alternatives.\r\n\r\nSee my point?\r\n\r\nHere's another:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-navajo20nov20,0,4270583,full.story \r\n\r\nfor a nice example of doctors \"proving\" things with studies. Doctors are only human. Many of them are less than 100% competent, and less than 100% unbiased.\r\n\r\nI recommend being very careful when dealing with studies that \"prove\" that things are harmless. \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165984968,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26388-b0221972-1120-43ef-84d8-367cf6109bde-1566236767"}

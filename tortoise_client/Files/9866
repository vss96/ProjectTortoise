The article is him asking for feedback on the syntax options available to him in the next version of VB.NET, which will support lambda functions (close enough to \"real\" lambda functions, although from past experience I would guess there will be at least a few irritating differences).\r\n\r\nHis terminology may have confused you because indeed it is confusing. VB has a nasty habit (which they call a \"philosophy\") of renaming things for the sake of making them more \"VB-ish.\" Another example of this would be \"Friend\" access modifier, which is the equivalent of \"internal\" in C#. I think this was a particularly bad choice of naming because it is completely distinct from C++'s \"friend,\" and all of the baggage that that brings with it. \r\n\r\nIt's just an unnecessary source of confusion, if you ask me, but they seem to be mostly concerned with people who have only ever coded in Visual Basic. There are, apparently, legions of them.\r\n\r\nLuckily, it looks like he has settled on calling them lambda functions.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20467-c6af6c46-d680-472f-8939-8cf4eb9a703f-1566236765"}

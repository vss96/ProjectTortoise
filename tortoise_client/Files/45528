{"controversiality":1,"body":"The article said, \"This talk was given at the LRC Health and Wealth Conference...,\" without any explanation of what \"LRC\" was. After a quick Google, I found: \"Lew Rockwell, founder and president of the Mises Institute in Auburn, Ala., and vice president of the **Center for Libertarian Studies**.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the Libertarian agenda is, and have no burning desire to find out, but bear in mind that while this may be a \"wealthy country,\" recent data from the Census Bureau shows that the number of uninsured Americans stood at 45.8 million in 2004, and the number of uninsured is steadily increasing.\r\n\r\nEven if you don't care that those who cannot afford health care live shorter lives of a lesser quality, you should at least care that uninsured people costs everyone.\r\n\r\nThis is a very real problem that is unlikely to be solved by taking cheap shots like, \"delusional left\" or \"Republican sloganeering.\"\r\n\r\nYou complain that \"we will surely hear talk of mandatory national health insurance, more spending for health care for the poor and elderly, and more taxes on individuals and business,\" but we pay for health care whether there is health insurance or not -- unless you finally admit you want to refuse treatment for those who cannot afford it -- and I think that is at the heart of your diatribe. You want to cling to every penny you earn, helping no one. Millions may die an early death so that you might die with a few extra dollars.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v25x","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-2,"ups":-2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166311061,"author":"DA5lD","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_v25x","edited":false,"id":"cv28b","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808722,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32966-542b01e6-a534-47d9-a447-15ce014ad7dc-1566236770"}

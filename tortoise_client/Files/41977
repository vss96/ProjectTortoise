{"body":"A guy I know was building, not a spherical house, but a geodesic one (which is pretty close).  He was all about the saving in materials because of the reduced surface area.  The problem was in the permits and inspections.  Code had it that there had to be vertically-oriented studs, paced at 24 inch intervals.  All of his studs came togehter in triangles, and few of them ran perpendicluar to the ground.  The inspector tried to make him **add** vertically-run, short-length studes inside the triangles.  When my friend grilled him on this, the inspector insisted it was because the outlet boxes had to be vertically oriented as well, and if some later owner wanted to add some, they'd need to know where to find the studs.\r\n\r\nThe extra 2x4s alone (forgetting the labor) would have put the materials **over** a conventional stick-frame house.  My friend fought for, and eventually got variances.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_td6l","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165205976,"ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"toastspork","edited":false,"id":"ctif8","parent_id":"t1_ctdmm","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807676,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"5932-ab86fcd0-191f-4650-a03d-2339081c444a-1566236760"}

No firewall, no routing, no protection unless the customer is savvy enough to install a software or hardware firewall.\r\n\r\nObviously, they aren't completely to blame as Microsoft has their share of vulnerabilities, but if the broadband companies had customer-premise protection, there would be a lot fewer compromised computers sending out spam and a lot fewer worms.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165419641,"ups":2,"score":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_tsh3","edited":false,"id":"ctue9","author_flair_text":null,"author":"marklubi","retrieved_on":1473807900,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11585-459935ed-b72c-4bee-a692-e5d7eea8cd26-1566236761"}

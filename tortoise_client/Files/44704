India (and China, which has a similar problem) will end up with surplus male populations.  In both cases the limiting factor will be the number of females who can reproduce in that generation.  I've seen studies that claim other animals' male/female birth ratios will adjust according to population pressure - I wonder if humans do that too?\r\n\r\nThere's some literature about the possibility of \"lost boys\" style gangs (like those cast out from fundamentalist LDS sects) becoming a real problem in Asian urban centers - undesirable men who cannot find wives because the gender ratio is so unfavorable.\r\n\r\nStill, it's one of those things that tends to sort itself out.

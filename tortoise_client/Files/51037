Plus it's faster that way. Plus it prevents most advertisements from running. Which makes browsing even faster.\r\n\r\nI use NoScript, which disables all JavaScript except for sites that I can temporarily or permanently authorize. Whitelisting sites is a simple clic-drag-release mouse action, not a big hurdle.\r\n\r\nSince I started using NoScript, I noticed most sites still work perfectly or reasonably well. NoScript has heuristics to turn the most usual JavaScript link tricks, such as window.open() and some concatenations, back to regular links. This helps a lot.\r\n\r\nOf course, I have permanently authorized the sites I visit regularly. I trust their JavaScript, and their JavaScript is useful. There's about 40 sites in my whitelist.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day, I visit many more sites. I have seen breakage in various shades of spectacular. Most of the times, the site is still readable, which is what matters to me. Some times I'll authorize its JavaScript, some times I won't. The cool thing is that, even in the cases I authorize a site's JavaScript, I don't have to authorize all the advertisement and tracking agencies it uses. :)\r\n\r\n(Also, NoScript blocks Flash objects by default. I can click the object to launch the Flash animation, if I fancy it. The web has become a quieter place.)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tm90","subreddit":"programming","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1165323081,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8776-664e9993-cf55-4b21-a2da-034dd7cd72ef-1566236760"}

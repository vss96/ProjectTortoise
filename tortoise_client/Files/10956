There are two parts to the article, and only the first one do I agree with.\r\n\r\nFirst, there's an argument against complexity that was introduced merely to make something look more ingenious than it really is. His examples are from academia, but I notice the same thing in real-world source code, documentation, and user interfaces. I once talked to the programmer of a small in-house application at the company I work. It had a screenfull of buttons to start and select the various subtasks of the thing it's supposed to do (sorry, no details). After some innocent questions, he admitted that the UI could be reduced to about one button. \"It can figure out what to do on its own. But then it would look less sophisticated.\" (That's a direct quote only after translation...)\r\n\r\nThe second point is that technical vocabulary is a kind of fabricated complexity. In my opinion, shunning technical jargon is fabricated simplicity. If your unfamiliar with the subject, it's difficult to get your head around a complex fold, no matter if it's called fold or aggregate-thingy. This reminds me of [an article about user-friendly mathematics by Dijkstra](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD889.html).","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809584,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwat6","id":"cwbdm","author":"xenon","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56066-68c102eb-dd8d-47d1-b7be-77f89e160c9b-1566236779"}

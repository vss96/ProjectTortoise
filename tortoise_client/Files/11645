Are you talking about hardware or software? (or both?) GHC 6.6 is supported on all of the platforms on which Debian is supported, (alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, sparc), and generic linux binaries are available for x86 and x86_64. For Windows, there's binaries for 95/98/ME/2000/XP on x86 (and special versions if you'd like better integration with Visual Studio). There is a binary for Solaris 10 on x86. Finally, Mac OS X is supported on PPC and Intel. I don't get how you group that into 3. I suppose if you group it into \"UNIXesque\", \"Mac\", and \"Windows\", it's 3.\r\n\r\nIt's also available in source form, but you need a previous version of GHC for your platform, and a bit of time to compile it. There are binaries available for slightly older versions, for FreeBSD (x86), NetBSD (x86), AIX 4.3 (ppc), and OpenBSD (x86, x86_64), which can be used to compile up to the latest release if you'd like (and it would probably be a good idea to submit the binary if you do, so that others don't have to compile it).","retrieved_on":1473809391,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw19f","parent_id":"t1_cw16e","author_flair_text":null,"author":"cgibbard","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50746-982440d2-100b-48f1-b047-6bf0fcacd538-1566236778"}

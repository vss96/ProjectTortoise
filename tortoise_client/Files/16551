It's not like we're being attacked by trans-fats, \"we\" are choosing to eat them.  If other people want to eat a tub of Crisco for supper, why is that any of your business?\r\n\r\nIf the government were really interested in promoting health by banning harmful crap, why is smoking still legal?  Oh, right, tax money.  We should also ban television, potato chips, couches and *not*-jogging.\r\n\r\n&gt; Government exists for this sort of legislation.\r\n\r\nThat sort of sentiment is why the government spends $2.25 Trillion/year, and why we have literally millions of laws, between federal, state, county, municipality and city laws, with many thousands applying to any one individual.  Of course, you're expected to know and understand every single one, because ignorance is not an acceptable defense.\r\n\r\nNo, the most common philosophical justification for the state is that governments (should) exist to protect the rights of individuals and to \"preserve justice,\" which is really the same thing.\r\n\r\nDo you have a right to low insurance costs?  Do you have a right to expect other people to behave in a way that keeps your insurance costs down?  You may feel entitled, but as far as the government is concerned you have no such rights.\r\n","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0iv","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50543-05e9ce53-ec67-47cb-ae65-5f34a1a7d02d-1566236778"}

Just a few slaves in history actually had nothing much to complain about, apart from not being free (read up on the ancient [Greeks](http://www.crystalinks.com/greekslavery.html)). Even though the Land of the Free used to be pretty good at slavery, it doesn't have exclusive historical rights to the practice.\r\n\r\nLet us first define [slavery](http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9378860):\r\n\r\n&gt; Forced labour for little or no pay under the threat of violence\r\n\r\nFits the modern-day situation rather well, don't you think? The \"modern-day\" part (which you conveniently disregard) means we are smart enough these days to implement such slavery in legal limbo. The status of slavery is simply not formalized by law. Sure, the current day victims are not bound by chains; they are bound by desperation. They are not literally owned.\r\n\r\nCalling their plight \"an unfortunate position\" shows a sublime talent for eupemish.\r\n\r\nAnother example is the relationship between the rich countries of this planet and the poor. It's the same modern-day slavery going on, just a bit further away and more sophisticated than in the past.\r\n","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36454-780412c0-f028-4605-b966-0a70b82b52f5-1566236772"}

I blogged on this topic here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.autodogmatic.com/index.php/a/2006/12/06/man_fakes_retardation_to_secure_governme\r\n\r\nMy point isn't to justify my own actions, it's to point out that we have no moral obligation to be honest to the government* (*the government is defined as any set of agents acting through government-granted powers through the institution of the State).  You can't commit fraud against the government (or the government's agents).  Therefore, the actions of this man *against the government* were fundamentally different than a similar mans actions against his fellow man.  \r\n\r\nI think a lot of people jumped on this b/c it's so easy to point the finger.  I wonder if many have really thought of the moral obligation (or lack thereof) of our actions with the State compared to our actions with other human beings.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22901-0e1786a7-6e9b-4a87-9a1c-e0905865de82-1566236766"}

Those are the ingredients for a Molotov cocktail.  Not that I planned to set one off... I'm only pointing out that I was able to carry on the components for one without problem.\r\n\r\nCheck http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_weapons for a brief introduction to improvised weapons...\r\n\r\nAnd see http://www.designobserver.com/archives/shiv1.html for photos of some weapons made by inmates.\r\n\r\nYou can see that every one of those weapons can be made with common household items that are allowed on airplanes.\r\n\r\nThe whole TSA is a giant act.  It provides virtually no added safety.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v8q5","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808900,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvbne","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v8q5","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37754-893bd6cf-c3b0-4516-987e-db543d1f2365-1566236772"}

Interviewers aren't supposed to ask you this stuff, but if you tell them of your own volition, all bets are off. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I take the opposite approach: when interviewing, I tell everyone who will listen that I'm married and have four kids. If that means they don't want to hire me, I definately don't want to work there anyway - I only want to work at places that are truly family-friendly. But this only works if you aren't desperate for a job.","created_utc":1165408179,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cttr3","parent_id":"t3_tpyd","author_flair_text":null,"author":"conrad_hex","retrieved_on":1473807887,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11299-9246ed15-1cfe-4e65-a2d0-41896f0aed49-1566236761"}

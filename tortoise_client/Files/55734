You owned a Pam IIX and a Zaurus, which you think were toys.  And somehow this means the Newton was a toy as well.\r\n\r\nThe Blackberry is a nice machine, and it is obviously built for its purpose, which is not what the Newton is built for.  But as far as small-device wonder technology (which is what our discussion is concerning), the Newton is *way* up there.\r\n\r\nThe Newton is not a Palm Pilot: it was a very advanced machine.  The Newton MessagePad 2100 is a 167MHz computer with an advanced proto-style object-oriented operating system inspired loosely by Sun's SELF design (and *far* more advanced than RIM's).  The Newton's database-oriented filesystem beats the crap out of the Blackberry's underlying system, allowing advanced, global per-application searches of a tremendous amount of data.  Its GUI is superior to the Blackberry in every way I can think of.\r\nIts handwriting input system is still better than essentially any other device on the market, and its GUI is built *around* handwriting, rather than viewing handwriting as an input device.  The GUI is famous for eliminating the number of taps etc. you have to do to accomplish anything.  You can use a keyboard as well of course.\r\n\r\nThe Newton has two PCMCIA card slots and nowadays rather straightforardly supports Bluetooth, 802.11, ethernet, cellular phone modem cards, among others.  It does MP3 playback, has a fairly advanced calendar, notes, and contacts system, wireless syncs of data, etc.  \r\n\r\nApple's employees are among the brightest in the world, and they did a very, *very* impressive job with this machine.  They can very easily do it again.  The Newton failed not because it was unimpressive but because it was *too* impressive:  Apple designed too much technological sophistication in it, and wound up with a price point (around $1K) which had no real market.  Palm, consisting of ex-Newton third-party software developers, figured this out faster than Apple and beat them to the $300 market sweet-spot with a vastly inferior, but cheaper, machine.  The rest is history.\r\n\r\nAs to the iPod's OS: I fail to see the point.  Apple bought an existing OS from a small company consisting of former Apple (and former *Newton*) employees for their v1 product.  They've modified it radically since then.  These people are not dummies.  And does the fact that these employees came *from* Apple not go against your basic premise?","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20579-fe5f127d-6b21-476c-8bce-2579dfd11ef9-1566236765"}

How about a simpler example:\r\n\r\n1. We know A is false.\r\n2. If we assume B is true, we can 'prove' A is true.\r\n3.

So we convert (i.e., *reduce*) the notion of B being true to that of A being true, giving us an absurd situation that can only be resolved by rejecting our assumption about B.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v4ak","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":9,"ups":9,"created_utc":1166405422,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34875-5694cf6e-bcf5-453d-ac3f-f7e0563bd3fb-1566236771"}

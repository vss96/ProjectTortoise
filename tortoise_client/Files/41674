I don't see how you can blame the African situation (which is similar to the American one) on the \"Great Society\", welfare and other white-caused effects.\r\n\r\nRight, because we all know that Africa has existed as a blacks-only microcosm, free from all interference by other races, for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nI find your use of the phrase \"maternal provisioning\" peculiar.  I looked up the phrase and found numerous references to maternal provisioning for organisms such as \"Rhamnus alpinus, a dioecious shrub\", \"Poecilia reticulata and Priapichthys festae\", \"viviparous cockroach Diploptera punctata\", \"frog Crinia georgiana\" and various freshwater fishes.\r\n\r\nI did not find any application of this term to humans.  Perhaps this is further indication of your eugenic beliefs.\r\n\r\nHowever, if by \"maternal provisioning\" you mean that the women in African societies tend to look after the children more than the men do, I would have to ask you which country or society you are using as a contrast to this behaviour, since in all the places I have been that is also the norm.  The stay-at-home dad is a rare breed in the countries I've been to in Europe as well as in Canada and the United States.\r\n\r\nSo the \"fact\" you desire an explanation for is certainly not exclusive to African societies.  I'll leave your juvenile assertion about '\"playa\" behaviour' aside for this response.  \r\n\r\nYour comments about Japanese people are equally naive - you appear unable to separate culture from genetics.  Do you really believe that Japanese have a gene that makes them more polite than other people?  Perhaps you also believe they have a gene that makes them good at Aikido, or a gene that makes them adept at preparing raw fish.  Maybe Canadians have a gene that makes us good at shoveling snow.\r\n\r\nHuman beings are not dogs.  That you would invoke the behaviour of greyhounds as an explanation for the social situation of black people in America is sad as well as offensive.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808759,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cv41f","edited":false,"id":"cv46k","author_flair_text":null,"author":"adrian","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33932-ed6fe5f0-4298-4ede-bcb2-c53d93271f4e-1566236771"}

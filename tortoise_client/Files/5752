And I assume that most of these high ranking officials that recently retired earned their stripes in the 80's, when the one of the biggest terrorism problems were Puerto Rican terrorism.  I think it would make sense that most of the counter terror officials in the FBI don't know much about Islam, because it has only been a domestic problem for a little over a decade, and only really emphasized since 9/11.  Most Islamic terrorism has been international, and that is the realm of the CIA.  \r\n\r\nThat said, the FBI definitely must make an effort to increase its knowledge of Islam.  But don't believe that these men are incompetent as counter terror agents because they know little about Islam.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165349950,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9747-044d06c9-7ff6-461b-a831-b717121ef32f-1566236761"}

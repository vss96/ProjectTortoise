Three decent options:\r\n\r\n1.  Buy a Euro-denominated CD.  There's a decent bank in Florida that sells 'em, and the CDs are insured by the FDIC.\r\n\r\n2.  Buy a European Bond fund.  T. Rowe Price International Bond fund is a decent no-load fund.  Make sure the fund doesn't hedge against currency swings, that would negate the advantage.\r\n\r\n3. Buy European stocks.  Not quite as good as bonds, since the European companies will come under stress if the Euro climbs a lot.\r\n\r\n4. If you have a spare $100,000  you can buy a European government bond outright.  Saves the cost of bond fund management.\r\n\r\n5. Buy Euros.  Bad because you won't be earning interest.\r\n\r\nBesides this inflation stuff, there is a looming threat that certain U.S. creditors will stop using the dollar as their principal reserve currencly.  That is what has recently put the dollar under pressure.  If it is true, the dollar is in for a long, long slide.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tkec","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165285121,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8073-969e4cc2-9918-4292-a9e2-965efd030be4-1566236760"}

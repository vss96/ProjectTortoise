Rape and mosquito bites are quite different. Besides, most people kill mosquitoes that are biting them.\r\n\r\nThere is no insect repellent option in assault. Would you suggest there's a more peaceful way to stop an attacker if you have no way to escape? Talk with them, maybe. Share your feelings...I don't think so. If you are in a position where you can't escape, then you have two choices: 1) be assaulted, or 2) or try to fight back.

Self-defense is not a bad thing.","retrieved_on":1473809138,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvnzi","parent_id":"t1_cvlb8","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dus7y","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43908-21ac06a3-6660-4166-b5a5-4b5621c9cad1-1566236774"}

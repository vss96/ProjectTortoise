Why can't we just TRY to be objective.  WHY OH WHY do white people always have to try to justify the brutality of their forefathers? \r\n\r\nI say it isn't so much that brown people are obsessed with race as it is white people obsessed with justifying their racism.  If you don't believe me, try to watch any film about culture, history, etc., and look for it.  You will find it; justification is always there. I spend my time enjoying History Channel, A&amp;E, and what-not, but I always always always have to edit out the white man justification for subjugation and \"manifest destiny\" bull-crap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":-8,"ups":-8,"created_utc":1165682960,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18585-c2ce91ae-fc00-414d-b1c7-cff6679b6274-1566236764"}

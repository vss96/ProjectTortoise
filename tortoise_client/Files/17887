I've used both a fair bit, and I just can't deal with Gimp, for two reasons. First, it's designed by engineers, not artists, and so it feels all wrong compared to photoshop. It's much harder to use. Second, the makers of the Gimp absolutely *refuse* to  allow even the option of single document interface (everything in one window, like photoshop). I know GNU is more or less based on multiple document interface, but clearly it's possible to have the option. They just don't think it's good design, and so they ignore the requests of thousands of users and would-be users. This is arrogant and annoying, consequences aside.\r\n\r\nI've never used Kdevelop, but I'll give it a try.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio.NET is miles beyond Visual Studio 6.\r\n\r\nemacs annoys me (I don't want to learn another set of arbitrary keyboard commands, one is enough for simplicity), so I use kate or jedit (*shudder*) or gedit (*double shudder*). kate is a recent choice, but it's working pretty well for me.\r\n\r\nI really like Scite (the scintilla editor that comes with windows ruby), and I wish it was linux/osx available, but so far all I can find is source files that I can't get to compile.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vs61","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48317-78cbc3a1-fde2-46f4-9bf6-c9ac66489c24-1566236777"}

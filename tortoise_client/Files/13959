Unexplained correlation is a clue and until it's understood all we have to go on are theories. So we take theories and try to disprove them. But the greenhouse theory is tough to disprove and it continues to gain credence among the scientific community. There is no competing theory that has as broad a following. Right now that unexplained correlation is all we have to go on but when I have to choose between a scientist whose study was funded by Exxon/Mobil or one whose study was funded by the NSF, I don't have to think too long about which result to believe.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809122,"gilded":0,"id":"cvn38","parent_id":"t1_cvmzs","edited":false,"author":"borg","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43425-73df41bb-07dc-454a-8dca-f20f2fe7b6c3-1566236774"}

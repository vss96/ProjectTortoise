Lets take EHTML for example (the one used in yaws):\r\n\r\n    {html, [], \r\n      [{body, [], \r\n        [{p, [], \r\n          [\"Hello \", \r\n           {a, [{href, \"http://www.reddit.com\"}], \r\n             [\"Reddit\"]}]}]}]}\r\n\r\nEveryone with a basic understanding of HTML can immediately derive the whole syntax of EHTML from this little example and it is much easier to manipulate in Erlang than strings (even if strings were not one of the weak points of the language) because lists and tuples are native datatypes.\r\n\r\nSimilar in Chicken Scheme's sxml:\r\n\r\n    (html\r\n      (body\r\n        (p\r\n          \"Hello\"\r\n          (a (@ (href \"http://www.reddit.com\")) \"Reddit\"))))\r\n\r\nLearning one of these will take you approximately 5 minutes, time you will easily save by not typing each tagname twice in these notations.","retrieved_on":1473809125,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvm0v","id":"cvn9u","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Taladar","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43538-230d4b94-88a4-4ae3-b983-66b5a8bc2837-1566236774"}

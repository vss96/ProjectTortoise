It’s part of fanning out the southern states and letting the northern ones curl in as the lines of longitude converge toward the pole. The curved Canadian border can even make it look like Maine comes north of the 49th parallel, which it doesn’t nearly.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you pull up Google Earth, you’ll find that Portland OR is north of Portland ME, that Seattle is fully 350 mi (a third of the coast) north of Boston, and that most of Cape Cod is south of the CA-OR border. Besides the curved 49th, I think people’s intuition is thrown by the colder weather in New England; we think of temperature as being about latitude even though we know about wind patterns.\r\n\r\nGo win some bar bets.","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165489429,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctyqj","parent_id":"t1_cty2l","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"celoyd","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807980,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13548-dae43d6e-c1fa-414e-a171-adc10c0685b6-1566236762"}

Unless you validate all their post, and end up annoying them. A lot.\r\n\r\n* It's extremely verbose, markdown (or Textile, or the MediaWiki syntax) often have a lower amount of syntactic noise, even if they're less powerful that kind of things is good when your users are creating the content\r\n\r\n* You have to escape it to protect yourself from XSS injections and stuff, and escaping HTML correctly is hard, especially since every browser has exploitable quirks in its HTML handling. This means that the best way is to build an HTML parse tree yourself, clean the parse tree, serialize it back to HTML and save that as your user's post.\r\n\r\nA lot of annoyance and hard work, for an extremely low (if existant at all) gain.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u1e3","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808102,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"masklinn","edited":false,"id":"cu592","parent_id":"t1_cu3zr","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16532-6658194a-fc9f-4fba-b064-19bf06c38527-1566236763"}

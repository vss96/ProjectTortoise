I have insurance, so Geico pays me the market value of the car. My one year old car, for which I paid $20k, has a value of $15k. I've lost $5k (it only had 1000 miles on it, I don't drive much) since I will replace it with the exact same new car.\r\n\r\nWhere did the $15k come from? Geico? No, YOU paid me, since the insurance company just raises everyone's rates to stay profitable.\r\n\r\nLet's assume Mr Car Thief only steals 1 car per month (way low). So 12x$15k=$180k/yr.\r\n\r\nI'm not including the costs of renting a car while mine is missing, my time while shopping for a new car, police time taking down the report of the theft and doing nothing, the FUCKING TAX I PAY REPLACING MY CAR...&amp;c.\r\n\r\nSo, I will happily pay for Mr Scumbag to go to jail, instead of Yale, since it will cost a LOT less.","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1165384659,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":-2,"score":-2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctsrq","parent_id":"t3_trhc","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"bobcat","retrieved_on":1473807870,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10869-939d8413-3aff-4e2f-a18a-547bbd986b1d-1566236761"}

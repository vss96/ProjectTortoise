In Vietnam, it was a legitimate criticism that the children of Senators weren't fighting, because in theory they should have been drafted at the same rate as everyone else, but in practice they used their connections to get out of the hard stuff. In Iraq, we have an all volunteer military, so the criticism is non-sequitur. \r\n\r\nIt's like saying, \"How dare you support eating those fish from Alaska that are really dangerous to catch if you don't send your children off to fish for it!\" or \"How dare you live in a brick house if you don't force your child to work in a brick factory!\" It makes no sense. \r\n\r\nThe people who fish in Alaska are well aware ahead of time that a lot of fishmen get swept over the side of the boat into the ocean and die. They get paid $100k for a summer as a result. People who work in a brick factory know that sometimes, a man falls into the ovens on accident. They too receive just compensation for their risks. \r\n\r\nA volunteer military is no different from any other risky thing people can do for money. The men and women who sign up are all over 18 and intelligent enough to understand and weigh the benefits and brisks. The pros of joining the military are it pays well; it gives benefits to your family even if you die; and it even gets you a lot of respect from others. The cons are a higher rate of injury or death than if you do some other job. \r\n\r\nDo I personally think the benefits outweigh the risks? Not really for me. I'm semi-pacifist and would rather do something else with my time. On the other hand, my brother and brother-in-law weighed the risks and came up with the opposite conclusion, which I respect. So far, it's done them a lot of good. They have job security, etc. They also have to worry about being shipped off. \r\n\r\nA draft is an idiotic idea, because it's the exact opposite of freedom. Freedom means each individual decides whether they want to join the military or not. A draft means we all die together whether there's something we 'd rather do or not. \r\n\r\nIf the problem is the military is too small, then the reason is the benefits aren't high enough. The solution to the problem is to increase the benefits. For 200k a year, _I_ might join the military for 5 years. For other people, that number is lower. So long as we have a volunteer army, people can decide for themselves what the number is. A draft army is the definition of slave labor, since you're forcing people to do a job they wouldn't choose to do themselves.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w3iu","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809505,"author":"earthboundkid","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw76n","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w3iu","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"53958-6f41fd55-6744-45b4-92dd-5bd273b9e16a-1566236779"}

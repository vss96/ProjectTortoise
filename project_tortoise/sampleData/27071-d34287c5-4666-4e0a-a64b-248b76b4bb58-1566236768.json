{"body":"In general, any publication that's ad-heavy makes its money on ads rather than subscription fee. Therefore, the bigger it is on ads, the cheaper it SHOULD be.\r\n\r\nThe caveat: people value things that they pay for more than things they get for free. That's why they charge for publications to begin with. If you pay, you want to read every page, and in so doing see lots of ads, which is what the publisher wants.\r\n\r\nThus, 6 euros (roughly 9 bucks) is simply too much up front to necessitate someone reading every page, without demanding likely unrealistic story quality from a monthly. \r\n\r\nJust a dollor or two up front should initiate fervid reading. Besides, if the publication's writing no longer drives its customers to read it, then its life is over anyway.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_up9q","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1166053729,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"andrewd","edited":false,"id":"cupig","parent_id":"t3_up9q","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808484,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27071-d34287c5-4666-4e0a-a64b-248b76b4bb58-1566236768"}

However, there will always be [\"reflexive/knee-jerk atheists\"(link)](http://reddit.com/info/scgc/comments/csd2f) who are just anti-Christianity..I am not sure if they know or if they follow the logic I try to explain below..)\r\n\r\nTo put it as simply as possible:-\r\n\r\nIslam and Christianity tell their respective followers to strictly follow the Quran and Bible as their respective \"absolute truths\".. So, when most Christians and most Muslims choose NOT to follow ALL the rules set by their respective religions [(stoning gays to death, etc(link)](http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/index.htm), they use that non-religious (evolutionary, hard-wired) moral sense.. \r\n\r\nAtheist (should want to) concentrate on exclusively on those inbuilt moral-values and try to analyze day-to-day scenarios/decisions using that moral-sense.. And do away with the silly, cruel, divisive effects of religion..\r\n\r\nAll Abrahamic religions (ie 3 of the top 4 major religions) demand denying other gods and religions..And profess conversion of \"non-believers\"..This social group of 'religion' is an unnecessary division in the otherwise (relatively) cooperative unit of human society.. Note that there are other boundaries to individual \"loyalty\" (cooperation), like countries, politics, race etc..Which may still foment wars and genocides, but religion is the most ignored of all these artificial \"boundaries\" to loyalty and  cooperation..\r\n\r\nIn early animal-life, co-operative behavior (in the long run) was rewarded by natural selection. Most of those interactions (decisions of cooperation V. defection) could be analyzed (in a very simplified form) as Prisoner's dilemma problems. These inbuilt traits of co-operation (within social groups) helped those animals survive the wild better, helped collecting food and protecting the young and even fighting rival groups (ie cooperation was only within social groups)\r\n\r\nA more advanced form of this cooperation (of rewarding others who cooperate and choosing according to circumstances whether to punish those who don't..) is seen in humans, again in decreasing levels according to \"closeness\" of the social group. (ie. One is (usually) most loyal to offspring and partner/spouse, then parents, then other family and so on to macro levels like country, 'religion' and species..)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Find more details in this 1987 documentary by Dawkins called  \"Nice Guys finish First\". (link)](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8068309038544717701&amp;q=Dawkins&amp;hl=en)\r\n\r\nA lot of time in the above documentary is wasted to demonstrate and explain the classic Prisoner's Dilemma problem. Skip that part if you already know what that is.. A computer simulation of various co-operative and non-cooperative strategies (over multiple runs and combinations) is used to prove over the long run, \"simulated social-organisms\" which use cooperative strategies survive longer (or get stronger) as compared to the cheats..\r\n\r\nAlso, Read Dawkins' book, I guess Chapter 6 and 7 of \"God Delusion\"..\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tq6l","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10860-d569b22a-af49-4c66-862e-eb7bf36c04b6-1566236761"}

If there were only one product, it would need to satisfy almost 100% of the users.  But, when there are two products, each one can satisfy 80% of users, with both products coexisting happily.  Now, real world, there are many products and each product could be successful satisfying just 20% of users.\r\n\r\nI just wish that most software vendors didn't aim for 99% of the users but actually end up satisfying only 10%.\r\n\r\nThe example of the journalist who needs a word-count feature is a good one.  The journalist types a lot of words, checks for errors, and views some statistics about counts and complexity.  MS Word is way overkill for that.  More of interest would be ways of hooking the text editor into data sources, such as AP and UPI, and web sites--with ways of storing references to the source material.  Not flashing text in 100pt Comic Sans.  Perhaps a Wiki is a better fit for a journalist than Word.  The point of this rambling:  consider your audience.  Just make sure you don't foolishly believe your audience can be \"all computer users\".  (Very few have succeeded at \"all users\": MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, Yahoo.)\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ualu","subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165767103,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20241-4151c2e4-dfdf-4cb3-a862-54279c267156-1566236765"}

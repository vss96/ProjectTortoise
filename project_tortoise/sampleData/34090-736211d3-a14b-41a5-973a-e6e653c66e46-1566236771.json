Some of that is due to genes.\r\n\r\nYou're saying \"human populations\" to avoid saying breeds of humans, because you know what dangerous ground that would put you on.\r\n\r\nNo one disputes that genes affect appearance, and genes also affect (but do not determine) human behaviour.  Where you're wrong (and racist) is when you apply the behavioural effects of genes to \"populations\" of humans.\r\n\r\nIt's uncontroversial to say an individual has a talent for music that runs in the family.  What you're saying, on the other hand, is akin to saying that black people are musical.  Except in your case you're claiming, among other things, that black men are genetically \"playas\".\r\n\r\nYour attempt to use science to justify your beliefs is not working.  At the root of all this is your belief that you are better than other people because of the colour of your skin.  Because of your \"breed\".\r\n\r\nThe American Heritage Dictionary defines racism as:\r\n\r\n&gt;The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.\r\n\r\nAnd what is race?\r\n\r\n&gt;1. a group of persons related by common descent or heredity.\r\n&gt;2.a population so related.\r\n\r\nYou are on common intellectual ground with some very nasty people.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34090-736211d3-a14b-41a5-973a-e6e653c66e46-1566236771"}

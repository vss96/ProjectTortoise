The same way you write the terminating bracket at the same time as the opening bracket in an \"if\" statement, I try to write, say, the \"fclose\" at the same time as my \"fopen\". \r\n\r\nKnowing there's no \"return\" buried in the code in between the open and close means I know the \"fclose\" is going to get called. A sneaky \"return\" in the middle feels like a \"goto\".\r\n\r\nI even like the progressively nested scopes; first, I can look at code and see what conditions it depends on, and second, as scopes nest deeper, it gets less comfortable to work (same as the comments on reddit), and that forces me to keep methods tight.\r\n\r\nMy acid test is, if I have to use a flag or something to break a loop or convey an error through the rest of the function, I've taken single-return too far, and either break the function up or write guard returns.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure most of the commenters here have thought this issue through more than the original post did.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14757-890f6902-2684-4149-8d9e-f1a74aa96d78-1566236762"}

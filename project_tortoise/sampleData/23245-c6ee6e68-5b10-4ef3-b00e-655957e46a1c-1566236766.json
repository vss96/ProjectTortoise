Certainly, it's the same kind of idea even if the implementation wasn't precisely the same.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, I like it when I learn about new vulnerabilities like this, because as a web developer I need to be up on this stuff.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I hate it, because I have clients that I've developed systems for in the past who are cheap and don't ever want to pay for new changes to be made, even if they are in response to security threats.\r\n\r\nPlus, it makes me a little paranoid about visiting websites.  If it's true this can be used to retrieve sensitive data, this is a major vulnerability.  It should be fairly trivial to write Javascript code that would send xmlHTTPRequests to Gmail, for example, searching for such information as \"username password\" or \"credit card\", retrieving matching emails, and then saving the results to a different server, again with xmlHTTPRequest.\r\n\r\nIf that would work, it could be huge.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uh5h","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23245-c6ee6e68-5b10-4ef3-b00e-655957e46a1c-1566236766"}

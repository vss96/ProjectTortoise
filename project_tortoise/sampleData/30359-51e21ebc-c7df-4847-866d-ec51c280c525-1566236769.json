I really like the idea of using multiple languages, but... I think a lot of people don't want to or aren't able to be fluent in a number of languages, so they tend to gravitate to one that they can use everywhere, even if it's not perfect for everything.  I have worked professionally in lots of languages, and I know that even I like to stick to a few at a time, so my reasoning is that someone who doesn't even like to learn new languages is very unlikely to want to have to deal with a new one for each task.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808612,"gilded":0,"id":"cuwfg","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuw78","author_flair_text":null,"author":"davidw","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30359-51e21ebc-c7df-4847-866d-ec51c280c525-1566236769"}

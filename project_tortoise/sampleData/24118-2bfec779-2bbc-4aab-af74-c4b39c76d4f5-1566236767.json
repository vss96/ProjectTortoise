I also don't find your lisp essays without examples very compelling, either... but that is a different story. Perhaps leaving out examples is a throwback to your days as a philosophy student. The only time I've ever read art books without art in them was back when I also majored in philosophy and had to take a few mandatory aesthetics requirements.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you mention the sistine chapel. It appears you consider it great art. Ok. I don't think anyone would disagree except the most jaded postmodernist. The sistine chapel isn't a very problematic case. It would be more useful if you picked a bunch of controversial examples and let us know how your theory applies to those examples. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\ngreat art or not?\r\n\r\nChuck Close:  http://www.geofffox.com/MT/images/chuck-close.jpg\r\n\r\nChristo's gates: http://christojeanneclaude.net/tg.html\r\n\r\nJim Dine's drawings: http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2004/dine/dine_ss.shtm\r\n\r\nAny architecture by Frank Gehry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry\r\n\r\nThe beatles\r\n\r\nMozart\r\n\r\nJeff Koons\r\n\r\nGiacometti's sculptures\r\n\r\nanything by Picasso\r\n\r\nWalt Kelly's Pogo cartoons\r\n\r\nChris Ware's cartoons\r\n\r\nSouth Park cartoons\r\n\r\nJackson Pollock\r\n\r\nPiet Mondrian\r\n\r\nOs Gemeos\r\n\r\nNeck Face\r\n\r\nM C Escher\r\n\r\nDostoyevsky\r\n\r\nMichel Houellebecq\r\n\r\nJK Rowling\r\n\r\nI've tried to purposely pick examples of art that a lot of people seem to like, but do employ some tricks, but even so, took a great deal of effort and skilled craftsmanship to create.

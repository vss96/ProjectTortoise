Furthermore, his definition of an \"idealist\" is rather vague.\r\n\r\nLook at what he uses  as examples of \"idealist frameworks that have caused enormous damage during the twentieth century:\"\r\n\r\n&gt;Other races are sub-human or evil compared to mine.\r\n\r\nThat's not idealist. Idealists were the ones who said that all races can get along. Racists were the ones who insisted that the most practical thing you can do with other races is to separate them - otherwise they would taint the racial purity.\r\n\r\n&gt;It's unjust that some people should be rich while others are poor.\r\n\r\nWTF? He really needs to elaborate here. Is he talking about communism? Or is he accusing anyone who works for social justice?\r\n\r\n&gt;The internet will destroy all existing businesses.\r\n\r\nI remember the idealists saying the exact opposite.\r\n\r\n&gt;America is responsible for all the world's ills.\r\n\r\nHuh? \r\n\r\n&gt;My nation is the greatest ever, and deserves unrestrained power.\r\n\r\nThat's something an idealists would never say. NeoConservatives, for example, are the most Machiavellian folks you'll ever find. \r\n\r\n&gt;My religion is the only moral one, and anyone who doesn't share it is unethical.\r\n\r\nThat's not an idealist - that's a fundamentalist.","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11754-89fc0c17-8c12-4fad-beec-1cd9fe0a4515-1566236761"}

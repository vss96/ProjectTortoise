Besides, if the shooter missed, the guy would probably notice if he, say, caught a 7.62mm round in his leg, or something.\r\n\r\n&gt; Not to mention, it doesn't remove beanbag guns and other nonlethal options.\r\n\r\nI don't think you're clear on the concept.  After missing the guy's gun, he would probably *not sit around waiting to be shot, lethally or otherwise*.  Instead, he'd probably start shooting back.\r\n\r\n&gt; A trained sniper hitting his target is NOT \"lucky\".\r\n\r\nI've had some sniper training myself.  You're mostly right: usually, there isn't much of an aspect of luck.  That doesn't change the fact that \"If they missed, they could just shoot again. Guns come with more than one bullet these days.\" was a really dumb thing to say.  The whole point of a sniper is getting it right on the first try.\r\n\r\nIf the police sniper didn't get it right on the first try, what would have happened was not a casual second try.  Instead, he would have waved his gun around, probably gotten a couple of badly-aimed shots off, then been gunned down in a hail of fire from the non-sniper police officers on the scene.  Later, the sniper would have been yelled at a bit by his first-line supervisor.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32693-a3e738aa-9d9b-47e9-b688-5b52fea98b0c-1566236770"}

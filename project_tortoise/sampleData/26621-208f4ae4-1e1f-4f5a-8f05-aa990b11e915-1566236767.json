I'm not sure what he's trying to say besides seizing people's money is a disincentive for them to make money, and that he's happy he has a lot more money than you.\r\n\r\nPeople who got rich through method X always advise method X, whether it's oil, marketing, cattle-raising, you name it.  Some people then think their monetary value implies that they are valuable as human beings.  Easy counterexamples: drug dealers, dictators, oilmen, business monopoly owners.\r\n\r\nYour money is determined by how much of it, X, you get per \"customer\", times the number of \"customers\" who give it to you, Y.  You can make the greatest widget ever and not market it well, and your \"value\" will be less, according to Paul, than if you make something crappy (imagine a scale from 0-10 where it's worth 0.00...something) but manage to sell it to a lot of people.  The idea being that being a teensy bit useful to a million people is worth more than being hugely valuable to one person.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, measuring value in dollars breaks down when you give stuff away.  Free software has tremendous value despite usually being available gratis.  Music can be downloaded illicitly; does that mean it has no value?  The counterexamples go on.\r\n\r\nI find it to be a rather muddled article, much like this comment.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165997112,"ups":7,"score":7,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuods","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuo45","author":"lemmikins","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808462,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26621-208f4ae4-1e1f-4f5a-8f05-aa990b11e915-1566236767"}

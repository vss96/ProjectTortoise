Condoms.  I'm assuming an end of the world scenario here.  Inflation, corporations tumble, unemployment skyrockets, peak oil, you name it.\r\n\r\nCondoms are easy to cary, easy to transfer, have an inherant value, and even resemble coins.\r\n\r\nThey would be nigh impossible to counterfeit in an apocolyptic society where plastics could not be molded so easily.\r\n\r\nAnd as one could imagine, they should trade at a high price in such a society.\r\n\r\nFurther, one can work through one's supply if the world doesn't end.\r\n\r\nCan anyone see any problems with placing some wealth into a stockpile of condoms?","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ve7i","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808962,"author":"EverydayEconomist","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvewk","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ve7i","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39375-88944742-5a30-4788-b376-7ca150e20666-1566236773"}

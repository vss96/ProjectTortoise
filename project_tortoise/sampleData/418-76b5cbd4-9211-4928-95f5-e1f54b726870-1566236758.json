Usually people who say blah blah complex blah blah too complicated to talk about blah blah are BSing their way into preventing people from investigating the topic, which is what I thought at first. However, it is thought of best in terms of a conditional probability table:\r\n\r\nSuppose you have only two values of intelligence, high and low. (Wrong assumption, but the following table scales to continuous values.)\r\n\r\nThen, you have two variables that intelligence is conditioned on, nature and nurture, or genes and environment. Suppose further that nature and nurture can each only be good or bad (Wrong assumption again, but again, it scales). Then you have four entries in the table:\r\n\r\nP(high|Nat=bad, Nurt=bad)\r\n\r\nP(high|Nat=bad, Nurt=good)\r\n\r\nP(high|Nat=good, Nurt=bad)\r\n\r\nP(high|Nat=good, Nurt=good)\r\n\r\nYou can infer the values of P(low|...) from these. However, you can't infer anything else. There is otherwise no relation between these four probabilities. The implication by the people who ask \"which is more important\" is that intelligence is a weighted sum of gene quality and environment quality, which seems false.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t48y","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1164942936,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"418-76b5cbd4-9211-4928-95f5-e1f54b726870-1566236758"}

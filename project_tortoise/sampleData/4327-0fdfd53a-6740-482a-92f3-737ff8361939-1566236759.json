Obviously, if we compared like-for-like, we'd either compare technical-with-technical or social-with-social achievements. (Of course, I don't consider this an important point, but we should be clear on our claims here.)\r\n\r\n&gt; Chomsky's linguistics and Einstein's math don't imply that either one of them know a great deal about economics\r\n\r\nWe're in agreement. But you should apply the same intense scrutiny to Gates' efforts. Do you have much knowledge of Gates' efforts? If you have in-depth knowledge (outside press releases), I'd like to read it with an open mind.\r\n\r\nAnd the nice thing about Einstein/Chomsky is that they wrote careful essays and analyses explaining why they dissent with their countries' sacred cows. (And as I pointed out, I'm glad Gates Sr. and Warren Buffett spoke out publicly too about how vital federal money was to their individual wealths, and how they're winning \"class struggle.\")\r\n\r\nAs for Jim Keady, I know nothing about him, so I can't comment. I'm sure you and I disagree on the general issue of so-called \"globalization\", but I can't speak to the validity of Keady's particular arguments.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tcs0","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807605,"distinguished":null,"author":"tayssir","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctely","id":"cteoa","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4327-0fdfd53a-6740-482a-92f3-737ff8361939-1566236759"}

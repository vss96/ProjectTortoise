Printf debugging in its sensible case of printing near a point that might help, is equivalent to setting a breakpoint and a watch. Either will interfere with a timing bug. That's why recording, rewindable debuggers are good: you aren't single stepping or doing IO when the bug actually happens.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand if you have a timing bug, you're probably using non-deterministic concurrency and getting it wrong. Consider switching to deterministic concurrency.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w55v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809508,"distinguished":null,"author":"JulianMorrison","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cw5co","edited":false,"id":"cw7b4","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54037-0be014f4-cac7-43c9-a442-90cedd6500e8-1566236779"}

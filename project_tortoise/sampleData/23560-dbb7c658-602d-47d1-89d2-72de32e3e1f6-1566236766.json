Unfortunately, arguing that drugs should be illegal because they allow people to be self-destructive is non-substantial.\r\n\r\nFamilies are torn apart by the illnesses and deaths of those whole smoke cigarettes.  I have seem litterally hundreds of people who died at the hands of tobacco and had the opprotunity to interact with their destraught family members.\r\n\r\nI have seen litterally hundreds of people who were hospitalized because years of not exercising and having a poor diet finally lead to their demise.  Their families are not less effected than anyone else by thier loss.\r\n\r\nI have seen litterally hundreds of people hospitalized for hepatits and HIV contracted from various activiteies.  Their families cry just like the families torn apart by drugs.\r\n\r\nDon't even get me started on alcohol and its effects and what pancreatitis looks like in its last stages.\r\n\r\nThe point is the the governemnt cannot in any way shape or form stop us from \"harming\" ourselves.  You can't outlaw fatty foods, sedentary lifestyles, and unprotected sex.  You can't effectively outlaw any kind of drugs.  It is the government's job to protect us from outside threats; not to protect us from ourselves.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uf7k","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808343,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"BLACKINFIDEL","id":"cui10","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuhvk","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23560-dbb7c658-602d-47d1-89d2-72de32e3e1f6-1566236766"}

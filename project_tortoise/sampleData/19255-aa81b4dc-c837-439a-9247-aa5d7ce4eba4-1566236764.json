And the guy had been told 10 times not to drive so fast in a residential area. And his answer was pretty much the same as yours ever time.\r\n\r\nSo maybe you're just a 'reddit tough' type who makes comments because of the wonderful anonymity of this medium. I hope so.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of kids, old people crossing the road, .... all the people who'd rather not be in the graveyard early.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you don't want to 'die a pussy' go do something brave, like volunteer work in a 3rd world country, say for Medicins Sans Frontiers or CIDA or.... Those people I respect.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19255-aa81b4dc-c837-439a-9247-aa5d7ce4eba4-1566236764"}

They have nothing to do with parsing or anything like that. Training them with real-world data sets to get desired results is something of an art and something I only have limited experience with.\r\n\r\nBut, there are entire books on how to go about training th em. The comp.ai.neural-nets FAQ has lots of good stuff and also the book \"Neural Smithing\" by Reed and Smith is chock full of practical advice.","link_id":"t3_ta5x","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165097430,"score":3,"ups":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3907-f9abd11f-fa8e-4ec7-89f4-b9f99f91d176-1566236759"}

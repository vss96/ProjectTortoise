First off it is stupid teachers. I have had many teachers who just didn't know what they were talking about. My world history teacher based our lesson of Troy on the movie.\r\n\r\nNext are standardized tests. Here in Florida we take the FCAT. The FCAT is just a tiny bit above what the state says is grade level. I am in higher level classes so the stuff we do on the FCAT is stuff I learned 2-3 years ago. So I get to take a week out of my high school year to take a test of things I learned 2-3 years ago. \r\n\r\nAnother side effect of standardized testing are \"benchmark testing. We have benchmarks every quarter that takes out 2 days of instructions. Also we have to write an essay every month which is one period gone. Every Tuesday and Thursday we have to read for 1/3 of ever period. We also have mini assessments which is another wasted period. You also can't forget the time teachers have to take out of their classes to teach us \"FCAT benchmarks\". One of my teachers added it up and it was like 40-50 days of some form of testing out of a 180 day school year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ut1n","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808568,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mk32066","edited":false,"id":"cuu2i","parent_id":"t3_ut1n","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29264-5d84cfd4-03dc-43b9-aaf3-b64bc754ddcf-1566236769"}

{"body":"China is not going to be the world leader anytime soon. Their economic growth is due to investments and not due to technological advance, which is the only way to be the leader and not catching up.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think the world really needs a \"primary currency\" just because now it is the dollar. I don't think there is any official measure of \"how much\" the USD is a primary currency, but its role as such is declining. With present FOREX volatilities, the companies prefer to reduce risk by keeping/investing in the currency that they have most of their expenses in.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vc4j","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166546113,"author":"ntoshev","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvde4","parent_id":"t1_cvcyl","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808933,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38547-e9bd7562-daab-48a3-b28e-f6d3825906df-1566236773"}

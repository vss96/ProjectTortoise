He's basing his reasoning for GM sucking on experience with rental cars?  First of all, rental cars are abused by idiots who don't understand shared resources.  Second, any car you're not used to will feel strange.\r\n\r\nThird, think about how many people *you* know that you would actually trust to tell you how a car drives.\r\n\r\nI absolutely agree that GM has lots of things wrong with it, even many of the things mentioned later in this article.  But, if I were this guy's editor I would have crossed out about half this article, re-read it, then called him into the office to ask him why he didn't write something original.","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59691-e18808b9-3697-4d21-a043-46f9ad531061-1566236780"}

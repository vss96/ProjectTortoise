Yeah, it can't be a linear distribution of karma, to prevent the intentional addition of dupes. I would say that you could solve this by taking into account the relative time of submission, much the way reddit already takes into account the time between votes to determine its top rankings, as well as deny access to the karma that has already accumlated into the pool for later dupe submissions. The first set of submission get the majority of karma where as later dupe submission get less of the karma pool relative both to their submission time and the amount of karma the older version sets have already accumulated.\r\n\r\nHow do you handle the case where a later submission gets more votes than the initial one, or initial sets of submissions?  The earlier ones probably should get a part of the more dominant later ones karma pool as a reward for being first, but they also probably shouldn't get an even split.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166899989,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"features","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47584-5505d86a-b65d-4d9a-9b26-d7f48782e32f-1566236775"}

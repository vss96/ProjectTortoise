The low quality of the posts is only outclassed by the poor quality of the commentary.  Really, it's become a sad place, full of combative, Mac-obsessed retards.\r\n\r\nI don't know much about social software and what-not, but the problem seems to be a lack of real community.  I've been a member of well moderated forums that thrive on the exchange of punishment and reward.  If you keep posting crap, you get banned.  If you're friendly and thoughtful or just interesting, you get rewarded.  So it can be done.\r\n\r\nThe difference, it seems to me, is that forums tend to not care how many new users sign up.  Sites like digg and reddit seem to be caught up in the mad dash to be the next big thing, and so you get a quantity of users rather than quality.\r\n\r\nSome ideas:\r\n\r\n1.  Get rid of bots.  Use CAPTCHA or whatever is needed.\r\n2.  Allow people to mark trolls as trolls.  Then allow a moderator to ban people if he needs to.  This is less democratic, but I've seen it work in message boards.\r\n3.  Don't allow people to downmod or upmod a post that they reply to.  This would go a long way to dampening the stupid, populist masturbation that passes for discussion and modding here.  I hate getting modded up just because people agree.  It encourages my worst habits.  And I hate being downmodded for the same reason.  It discourages new ideas.\r\n4.  Limit the amount of mods for comments?  Per day?","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12974-77ec8396-3820-46b7-b596-418c97673247-1566236762"}

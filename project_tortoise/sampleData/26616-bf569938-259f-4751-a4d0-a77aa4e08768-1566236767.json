Like the believer, upon reexamination, their beliefs fall apart. We have a number of index funds available in which to invest. Each offers a differing risk / reward value. But it's pretty easy to see that some companies in an index are disastrous and headed for bankruptcy, or are so poorly managed that we would not invest in them outside of that index. \r\n\r\nA good example is SMH, ML's Semiconductor Holdr, which dropped Vitesse Semiconductor this summer(VTSS). A shrewd investor who trimmed the fat from an index, the underperforming and classically overvalued companies, would have outperformed the index. We can apply this on a larger scale. It's well known that low P/E companies outperform the market even controlling for risk. If we can cut out underperforming stocks from our holdings, we can do better than index. Eventually, we'd want to hold only the top n percent of stocks. These stocks in theory make up the buy sheets of the major banks. We now see a shift to elimination of problem stocks in indexes in the use of 'fundamentally weighted indexes.'\r\n\r\nHowever, the banks have market power, and move the prices of these stocks up, so only the first few clients really gain. The key to beating the market is to have more information than the market - independent research finding the most undervalued - both growth and near-term - stocks delivered to very few people and acted on in ways that don't scream through the street - like the volume increases when an investing newsletter comes out.\r\n\r\nOf course, this would require a lot of work, and it's a hell of a lot easier to push some prepackaged product.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to outperform the market, use the margin account your broker offers to buy index funds. It'll increase your risk but also your expected return.  Buy and sell such that you keep your margin percent use constant. This is an unsatisfactory strategy for many people, but it should do quite well.\r\n\r\nPS not investment advice the internet is a shitty money manager blah blah blah","link_id":"t3_unas","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808462,"distinguished":null,"author":"bosmat","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_unas","id":"cuodd","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26616-bf569938-259f-4751-a4d0-a77aa4e08768-1566236767"}

For adult men over 144lbs it's safe to eat only six ounces a month, but then if you do then you aren't allowed to eat any other fish that month. For women and children it's never safe to eat swordfish.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oceansalive.org/eat.cfm?subnav=fishpage&amp;group=swordfish\r\n\r\nAlso, where there are some excepts, that vast majority of goods we buy on a day to day basis are getting rapidly cheaper. In 1957 one dollar could be a single transistor, today one dollar buys over 20 million transistors. The prices of food, tech, clothing, education, travel, etc. are dropping like a rock and have been since the beginning of time. Maybe if you look at only certain examples in certain geographical regions over only a few years you will see an increase, but overall it's quite the opposite.\r\n\r\nStuff that only the super rich could afford just a few years ago can now be had easily by the middle class. Indoor plumbing, air conditioning, cross country vacations, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that stuff only the super rich can afford today won't be available to the middle class in 50 years.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u476","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17035-937e1248-0fd2-4c8d-8e54-cd45545c5659-1566236763"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Sure, however the argument does not make sense. Ok, so the US only accounts for the 10% of German sales, not a big deal, right? Except what about the other countries Germany sells to. Given that the US prices are lower, those countries might be tempted to buy more American goods. Once again Germany loses on the exports.\r\n\r\nOne company that is (or should be) crying is Airbus. Given that the costs for Boeing are going to go down, Airbus will have even harder time staying competitive. They will probably start shutting down some of their European plants and firing the workers (unless they can not, in which case they will go bankrupt) and moving those jobs overseas. Of course European governments will try to prop this up, but that will cost Europe a lot of money.\r\n\r\nMy point in this is...Europeans are not immune from this. If the USD falls, then Europeans have become less competitive, and their currencies will start dropping as well. However, this is all relative....probably to Yuan, and other Asian currencies.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ule3","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165981943,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"author":"bahhumbug","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuns6","parent_id":"t1_cumr6","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808450,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26332-a12aa653-8299-4aa9-b78b-1a178d7b816f-1566236767"}

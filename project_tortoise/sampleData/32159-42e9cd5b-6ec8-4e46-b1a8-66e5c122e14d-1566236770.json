These \"zero tolerance policies\" are mind numbingly retarded. And the number of good kids who have become victims of them are absurd. Think about it for a minute. We have all these \"gun free zones\". No guns here! But where do crimes with guns happen? IN THE GUN FREE ZONES of course! Sure, it's a great idea to ban fire arms on the campus of a high school. But to throw away common sense to cold, inhuman zero tolerance policies is insane. Administrators of schools are there to administrate and to use their fucking heads, not to parrot some lame zero tolerance policy so they don't have to actually make any real decisions. It's as if not having zero tolerance policies, they would somehow undermine their own policies and then the school would be filled with armed students. I mean, what exactly is the aim of these policies? Why would someone with real INTENT to bring a weapon to school be encouraged to do so just because guy in special cirumstance X didn't get expelled?","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808684,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuyeu","edited":false,"id":"cv07g","author_flair_text":null,"author":"crypticgeek","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32159-42e9cd5b-6ec8-4e46-b1a8-66e5c122e14d-1566236770"}

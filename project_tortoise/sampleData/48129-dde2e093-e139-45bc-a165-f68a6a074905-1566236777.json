This fact that the copy does not deprive the owner of property isn't really important.\r\n\r\nActually, it's central to the *idea* of theft.  Either it is theft, or it is not.  If it is, then the owner cannot still have it.  \r\n\r\nBtw, in three, you assume your conclusion.  That is, saying \"the owner of the song\" here is sleight of hand you're using to mean \"the owner of the original song\", when the song I'm copying is a copy, not the original.  Presumably, in a sane legal system, the owner of that original copy would have a contract with those to whom she sold copies if she wanted to restrict further copying.  In fact, though, those selling copies of songs today often do not even pretend that they have made a contract with the purchaser (which is good, since it's pretty clear that they don't have most purchasers' signatures to that effect); instead, they want to legislate their income.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I sell software for a living, so if I were going to rationalize a position, I'd be rationalizing the one that maximized my income, no? :)\r\n\r\n[Edit: P.S. Starting out by asserting that those you disagree with are dishonest/rationalizing isn't going to convince any of us who disagree with you.  Just a tip. :)  ]","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vtf3","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809296,"author":"randallsquared","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvw67","parent_id":"t1_cvv52","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48129-dde2e093-e139-45bc-a165-f68a6a074905-1566236777"}

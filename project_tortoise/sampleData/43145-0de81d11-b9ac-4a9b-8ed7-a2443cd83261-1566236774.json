Unlike the other major remaining faiths, Hinduism continues the polytheistic and animist beliefs that preceded the rise of monotheism. You can make the case that Hinduism changed drastically after the Mahabharata was written, but in my eyes it's still the same religion that was practiced 5 or even 10 thousand years ago.","link_id":"t3_vgrv","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809110,"distinguished":null,"author":"jkerwin","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvkbr","id":"cvmiz","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43145-0de81d11-b9ac-4a9b-8ed7-a2443cd83261-1566236774"}

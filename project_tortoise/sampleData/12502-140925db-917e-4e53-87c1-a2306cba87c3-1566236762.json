He wore a tank top, bluejeans,and had a big \"medicine bag\" tied around his next. The medicine bag was odd, but wasn't going to blow the interview for him, but the tank top did as soon as he walked in.\r\n\r\nWe interviewed him for entertainment value since he was somewhat crazy.\r\n\r\nWhen he didn't get the job he tried to sue for racial discrimination as a native American, even though in the interview he brought up the fact he wasn't, but had adopted the lifestyle. We never brought up race, he did, and we ignored it when he did guessing the game he might try and play.\r\n\r\nWe almost had to hire him too just because of the fear this sort of thing brings a company.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tpyd","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12502-140925db-917e-4e53-87c1-a2306cba87c3-1566236762"}

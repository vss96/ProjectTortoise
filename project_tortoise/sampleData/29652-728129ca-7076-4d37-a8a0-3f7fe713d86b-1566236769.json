{"controversiality":0,"body":"It is a light example; but pieces of the Oracle suite are written in java.  The java drivers come included with the Oracle purchase, etc, etc.  The smalltalk oracle drivers don't exist?  Haskell Oracle interfaces?  And then move to the next database, SQLServer?  Postgres?  And then what about GUI libraries.  My point in using database drivers as an example; typically you can find a up to date jdbc driver; if the lisp database driver doesnt work with my version of lisp, how can I write a database application?  Write my own engine?  How much will that take?\r\n\r\nOf course this argument has nothing to do with the important aspects of language design which java seems to lose a lot of battles on.","link_id":"t3_utqb","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166152982,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"author":"berlinbrown","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuuq9","id":"cuurd","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808581,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29652-728129ca-7076-4d37-a8a0-3f7fe713d86b-1566236769"}

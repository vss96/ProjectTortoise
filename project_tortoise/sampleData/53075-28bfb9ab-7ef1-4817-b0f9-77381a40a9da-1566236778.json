That article was awful, yay for anecdotal evidence.\r\n\r\nPS3 won't die...yet.  All systems have bad launches, the 360 did better than most, but it was still kinda short on groundbreaking launch titles.  That said, the PS3 has an even worse launch lineup than the Saturn did.  Resistance is the only good game (that's exclusive) and it's not very good, it's a derivative shooter with a neat storyline.  It feels like playing CoD with worse AI and shitty weapons.  Even the multi-platform games it launched with aren't the cream of the crop, and why would I spend 560$ to play a game that I can spend 360$ to play?\r\n\r\nQuickly! Point out that the PS3 just came out and the 360's had a year to build up a library! (wait for it)  So what?  That's what you have to face when you delay for a year, the 360 now has a killer lineup of quality games to compete against, it didn't when it launched, it does now.  Gears of War, Viva Pinata, Geometry Wars, Assault Heroes, Small Arms, PGR3, GRAW, R6: Vegas, Dead Rising.  And those are just the games I like, I could keep listing things for awhile if I listed all the well reviewed games.  Now if you want to time-travel to the future a year from now and bring back some PS3 games, you might be on more level footing but Sony decided to wait till now and it's time to put up or shut up.  I want games I can play now, not games I might be able to play in a year that might be good.  \r\n\r\nI buy consoles for the games they have, not the games they might have.\r\n\r\nI'm excited to see what the modder community can do with the PS3, turning it into a super-powered media center is awesome...but that depends on Sony releasing specs for the SPE's which I don't recommend holding your breath on, see: PSP hacking.\r\n\r\nSony botched this release worse than any other launch I can think of.  They waited too long and let the competition get too strong, then come out with too weak a gun.  They could possibly make up the ground, but MS has more money and wants victory a lot more than Sony right now.  Sony needs to get more (good) content out there and fast or they will fall into obscurity, they're not invincible and I don't want to see them die.  MS will crush Nintendo 1v1, you think they aren't capable of a motion-controller for the 360?  Think harder, MS steals all that is good from those around them then makes it their own and they're reasonably good at it.  I like that competition has made the 360 great, and I want Sony and Nintendo to keep providing that competition.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w37e","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809475,"author":"PhilK","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w37e","id":"cw5nx","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53075-28bfb9ab-7ef1-4817-b0f9-77381a40a9da-1566236778"}

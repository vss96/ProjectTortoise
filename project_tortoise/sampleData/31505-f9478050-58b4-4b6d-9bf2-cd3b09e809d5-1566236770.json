Really the best situation possible - time and money to work on it without any actual interference by the corporate heads.\r\n\r\nWhen PyPy gets to a stable stage, Python is going to be in perhaps better shape for the future than any other language. Those are pretty controversial words I imagine, but Python already has a very stable environment (compare to say the confusion in the Ruby community about the next VM), has tons of libraries, and now you've got an advanced implementation being worked on along with a language designer who has more time with the language itself than ever before.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uydn","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166219853,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":18,"ups":18,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31505-f9478050-58b4-4b6d-9bf2-cd3b09e809d5-1566236770"}

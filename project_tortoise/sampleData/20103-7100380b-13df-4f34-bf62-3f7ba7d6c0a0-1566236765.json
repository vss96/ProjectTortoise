In what amounts to a gruesome adult daycare.\r\n\r\nBut if we looked at any other nation which did this to its own citizens, I think we'd clearly see that humans are not naturally so criminal. Perhaps there are laws to control minority populations, like marijuana prohibition was intended to [control spanish-speaking immigrants](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dope/etc/cron.html). Or in Florida, voting rights are stripped from felons in laws dating back to [when newly-freed slaves gained the right to vote](http://www.aclufl.org/issues/voting_rights/florida_voting_ban.cfm).\r\n\r\nAnd we can guess what this system does to families, neighborhoods and the general feeling of fear in society.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ual4","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808223,"author":"tayssir","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cubq2","parent_id":"t1_cub8c","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20103-7100380b-13df-4f34-bf62-3f7ba7d6c0a0-1566236765"}

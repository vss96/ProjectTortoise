The building had started leaning and making creaking noises so fire department officials ordered the evacuation of the area over an hour earlier. The visible collapse of WTC 7 was fairly quick. But seismic readings time the rumblings of the building (culminating in collapse that measured 0.6 on the Richter scale) to 30 seconds before the mechanical penthouses on top start to cave in. What did they do fake the seismic activity?\r\n\r\n&gt;It's kind of funny how the Pentagon has no video of the plane hitting it.\r\n\r\nKind of unfortunate, all the video speeds where too slow to pick up much of anything.  Good thing there are lots of eye witnesses that saw it happen. \r\n\r\nbut please, lets hear your \"common sense\".","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166117120,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28301-e4a7d545-a9a9-4459-b6da-1317fb9cc09e-1566236768"}

Neither is especially strong though. _Manko_ (cunt) is strong enough that you're not allowed to say it on TV, I think, but people don't use it as an interjection either. _Shimatta_ just means \"it turned out poorly.\" People say that a lot. If you don't like someone you can call them an _aho_, _baka_, _baka yaro_, or other word for idiot. Or just use rude pronouns and verbs, which is more common.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12761-8261c24b-41c8-425d-b44b-fe3a15c2f48e-1566236762"}

{"body":"On one hand, Chavez been democratically elected by a high margin, so he's not a dictator. (Maybe he's a Decider.) I have a hard time imagining any US president tolerating a corporate TV station [supporting coups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCTV#Criticism) against himself for a second (as with the coup in which Chavez was briefly kidnapped, which the US supported). The notion would be lunatic.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand though, I don't get the impression this was settled by a more democratic referendum, which the Wikipedia article claims had been proposed by Venezuela's Minister of Communication and Information. So I too think this appears to be a bad step, as far as I can tell right now.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wk58","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1167607969,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"tayssir","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cwk5c","id":"cwl1x","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809764,"timestamp_epoch":1566236781,"message_id":"60987-d0150ed1-c2fb-431f-8c02-a065c5b9078e-1566236781"}

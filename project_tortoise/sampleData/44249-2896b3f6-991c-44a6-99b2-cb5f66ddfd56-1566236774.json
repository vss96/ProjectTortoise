Bjorn Lombard's statistical analysis of climate studies showed that the climate is actually improving.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that global warming can cause millions of deaths. However, I'm not convinced that humans are causing it, therefore I think that the proposals for reducing CO2 emmissions - largely through virtual nationalization and regulation of those industries that create the most CO2 - will do more harm than good.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, restrictions on CO2 emissions will harm 2nd and 3rd world countries more than the Western nations that are proposing the limits. We're pretty close to moving away from fossil fuels entirely, while most of the rest of the world is using them to lift themselves from subsistence farming into the industrial age. For us to come along and say \"Um, no sorry - you can't have these cheap fuels now. Keep on scratching in the dirt for a few more decades.\" seems to be be rather hypocritical.","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1166735451,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvobe","id":"cvoix","author":"NoFixedAbode","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473809149,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44249-2896b3f6-991c-44a6-99b2-cb5f66ddfd56-1566236774"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt;Just out of curiosity, what exactly has MS done to the open source community aside from saying \"We're better\" and refusing to give away their own code base?\r\n\r\n* Ballmer's recent accusations of Linux IP infringement without proof. Although his minions back-pedaled on his statement, I still don't trust him, Bill, or Microsoft.\r\n\r\n* FUD: Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.

I didn't know that about Apple. I switched from Apple to Windows one year before Windows 95, and then switched from XP to Linux in 2000. I've never gone back. When I arrived at Linux, it was the year it went cool with RH8. I'm now on the latest [Ubuntu release](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop), as well as my wife and children, and I run it as my primary system at home and in the office.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t0wf","subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1164938344,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"supermike","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ct6bh","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct680","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807448,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"270-607573ff-892e-4aa2-9f71-c64e25be683b-1566236758"}

Similarly \"plans\" are exhibited according to the natural and stochastic behavior of ecological and evolving systems; even though there is a stochastic component, there's something more as well.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the word \"random\" is bound to open up a can of worms.  Check out [Bertrand's pradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand's_paradox_(probability%29).  Without a clear, specific, and technical definition, \"random\" can only lend confusion to a discussion.  The term stochastic, which incorporates the idea that future states are \"random\" but with dependency on the current state is much more representative of evolution.  And pretty much any space seraching strategy, from simulated annealing to Metropolis-Hastings or whatever, is stochastic more than it is random.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx5n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48800-e3994e1e-3023-494c-afc7-c1395aae26ec-1566236777"}

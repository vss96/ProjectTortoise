Like machine guns and short-barreled rifles and shotguns, they're Title 2 weapons (normal firearms are Title 1 weapons). A private citizen with a Class 3 license can purchase any of the above items, while a corporation with a Class 2 license can manufacture them, as well as do anything associated with a Class 3 license.\r\n\r\nPeople who are serious about these things set up a side business and get a Class 2 license, as it confers numerous advantages over a Class 3 licence, sush as being able to own Title 2 weapons manufactured after 1986.\r\n\r\nTransferring a Title 2 weapon, with a few exceptions, requires paying the government a $200 transfer tax. This isn't a big deal these days, but the fee was originally set in 1934! Some folks think that the whole Title 2 licensing structure was put in place to give federal agents something to do after prohibition was repealed.\r\n\r\nSilencers themselves are amazing gadgets. With subsonic ammunition, most of the noise comes from the weapon's action cycling. With supersonic ammunition, the signature is a bit louder, but there's still absolutely no need for hearing protection. When shooting steel targets with a submachine gun, the clang of the bullets hitting the steel is louder than the muzzle blast.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_twl8","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13579-e9859e82-7042-4e59-934b-4b1b34cd8937-1566236762"}

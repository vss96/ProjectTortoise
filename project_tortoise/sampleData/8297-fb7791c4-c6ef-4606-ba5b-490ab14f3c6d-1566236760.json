Any hardware that is going to work - which is most of it - will work just by plugging it in.\r\n\r\nYeah, and any hardware that doesn't work when you first plug it in will either require countless hours of effort to get it to work, i.e. kernel patching/upgrading/recompiling, or, more likely, never work at all.\r\n\r\nI know I'll get downmodded for this, but it basically sums up my experience with Linux hardware interoperatability. Linux supports a lot of stuff out-of-the-box, which stuns me when I first discovered, say, how my WiFi/ethernet PCMCIA just worked when I plugged them in. But when it comes to less popular/less standardized hardware, well, you're out of luck. Yeah, I know you can always hack your way around, assuming you're an experienced driver programmer, but that's far from what \"just works\" means.\r\n\r\nWindows driver installation is what I'd say \"just works\" (insert the CD, several clicks, and it's done), though it's due to the fact that it's the most popular OS around and thus most worthy of the hardware vendor's effort to package a driver for.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8297-fb7791c4-c6ef-4606-ba5b-490ab14f3c6d-1566236760"}

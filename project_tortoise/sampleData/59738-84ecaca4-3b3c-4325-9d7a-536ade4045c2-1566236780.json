I enjoy it.  Rot-your-brain programs especially. I also like to read fiction.  It is probably at least as much of a time waster as tv.  Neither really serves as teaching me about plants, the animal kingdom, or how to tell when a tsunami is coming.\r\n\r\nDoes that mean I should stop reading fiction and watching tv?\r\n\r\nBtw, I also like porn. It serves very little in the way of a productive activity as well.  I'm not about to stop watching it because you feel it doesn't meet other people's requirements as educational.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167544775,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cwhpv","edited":false,"id":"cwis9","author":"nosoupforyou","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809721,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59738-84ecaca4-3b3c-4325-9d7a-536ade4045c2-1566236780"}

For example, here's what the [Washington State Department of Transportation](http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/biz/trafficoperations/traffic/limits.htm) has to say:\r\n\r\n&gt; Q. What if the majority are driving too fast?\r\n\r\n&gt; A. What's actually more dangerous is when motorists are traveling at varying speeds.\r\n\r\nHere's [iBiblio's speed limits FAQ](http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:i2a856NceTcJ:www.ibiblio.org/rdu/sle-faq.html):\r\n\r\n&gt; Driving the limit is often MORE dangerous\r\n&gt; Why? Because most of the time you are going against the natural flow of traffic and there for creating the least amount of problems if you go the speed limits others will have to pass you. Studies have proven that.\r\n\r\nAnd [DrDriving.org](http://www.drdriving.org/articles/activism.htm):\r\n\r\n&gt; Many traffic engineers agree with the theory that driving is safest when speed limits reflect actual driving rates on that road rather being set lower as an attempt to slow down the traffic.\r\n","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1166662213,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42225-b855af15-c920-4d8f-ace6-ed28c2ddeda3-1566236774"}

Some old guy in the UK who still had a hunting rifle... victim of a home invasion. He shot them, but didn't kill all of them. Went to prison for longer than they did.\r\n\r\nI think you're talking about the [Tony Martin](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/3087003.stm) case.  He was burgled at his home and shot one of the two intruders in the back with a shotgun as he tried to make his escape.  That makes one a burglar and one a killer.  Is it really a surprise that the killer got the longer jail term?   Actually his murder conviction was reduced to manslaughter on appeal and he got out after 3 years.\r\n\r\nUnder UK law, Martin would have been acquitted if his life had been in danger and he had been using the gun in self defence. As it was, he was just trying to stop someone stealing his TV.  In this country, you can't kill someone for doing that.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808215,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuaan","id":"cuba2","author":"muttleee","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19921-3bc79faf-87e2-4bbe-b3c2-936484d432bf-1566236764"}

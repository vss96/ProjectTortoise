{"body":"&gt; Bullshit. The federal government has the power over the purse--they can choose to cut federal spending, end the war in Iraq (a war that is on its way to costing $1 Trillion) and rein in the regulators who are running up the costs in so many industries.\r\n\r\nWhat odds would you give?\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, hyperinflation and bankruptcy aren't likely. The government know that they can't print their way out of the problem so there will only be a prolonged period of high inflation, high interest rates as the dollars arrive back in the US. It's going to be hard, unpleasant but I don't see a reason for a collapse.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vdbm","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166568485,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"css1971","edited":false,"id":"cvf8w","parent_id":"t1_cve4k","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808969,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39570-d962c495-2125-4915-8e13-17c79fe8af22-1566236773"}

What the @#$% do they think is going on in Iraq?  When there are Shiite death squads targetting Sunnis for revenge after years of oppression, do they think there is nothing behind that?  When there are Sunnis deliberately killing troops and trying to destabilize the interim government, do they not realize that the Sunni minority is trying to hold onto power?  \r\n\r\nDo these people think that there are no difference between Democrats and Republicans, because there is no \"actionable\" (whatever *that* means) difference between them?\r\n\r\nWhen Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants fight, do they say that it's unimportant to realize that there are two sides?  \r\n\r\nWake up and smell the coffee chumps, ignorant assholes like you drug us into a quagmire in Iraq, and ignorance sure as hell isn't the way out of it.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10397-dd672a3e-695f-4c5b-a544-f37bc2be86a1-1566236761"}

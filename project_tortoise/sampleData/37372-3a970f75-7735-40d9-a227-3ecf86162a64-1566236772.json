To the East lies a huge (about 100 million people) and mostly not a very friendly country (propaganda war seems to be a favorite pasttime of the Kremlin these days), which during 1940-1991 was occupying Estonia and trying to exterminate Estonian language and culture altogether (sadly, today's Russia and USSR are not as different as some would like to believe). I'm just saying the situations are extremely different and not really comparable.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v7fq","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37372-3a970f75-7735-40d9-a227-3ecf86162a64-1566236772"}

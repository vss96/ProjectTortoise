Don’t claim that they are more useful than somebody else’s scientific results. You are not the right person to judge that! That other people who use it decide whether it’s useful or not. Leave that question open!\r\n\r\nDemonstrating the uses of your advance goes with the territory.  The point of an actual scientific development is to show useful applications for it.\r\n\r\nFalsely pretending your discoveries have no use is not \"objective\".  If you didn't see a use for them, you wouldn't have pursued them in the first place.  We work on problems we find interesting for subjective reasons.  Explaining these reasons and uses will appeal to others to continue the research.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165687740,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u7w7","id":"cu948","author_flair_text":null,"author":"lemmikins","retrieved_on":1473808175,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18731-9b01f71d-a2e0-44c5-8c26-a638bfc08e73-1566236764"}

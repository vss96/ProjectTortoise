We were certified Dell Warranty Parts Direct and Apple Authorized Service Providers. Dell always had parts and Technicians (usually sub-contracted to Unisys) next day. Apple always wanted us to troubleshoot it for a week or more before they'd send a part and they *never* would send a technician even when the machine was covered by Apple Care. We could get a Dell fixed in one to two business days... three days tops. Apples took two weeks.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167413024,"score":13,"ups":13,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57024-6ca5585d-1da5-4d8e-bf09-4ae1cb592c08-1566236779"}

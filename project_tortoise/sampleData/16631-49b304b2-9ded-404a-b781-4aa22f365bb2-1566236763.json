It is a simple but elegant XOR swap that is no shorter than a temp swap, but doesn't need the extra memory.\r\n\r\nAs for the bulletproof c code, if you want your interviewie to write bulletproof code, you should tell him that, not ask him to come up with an efficient algorithm for a string reversal.","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16631-49b304b2-9ded-404a-b781-4aa22f365bb2-1566236763"}

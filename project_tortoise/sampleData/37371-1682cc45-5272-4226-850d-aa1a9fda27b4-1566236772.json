{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vabv","controversiality":0,"body":"That link is just terrible blogging that tries to spin this as something completely different. Note there was no reference to the word \"porn\" in this article and the word \"sexual\" seems to have been purposefully expunged from the text. Here's what [McCain really says](http://mccain.senate.gov/press_office/view_article.cfm?ID=774).\r\n I don't see a huge problem with it because it is an attempt to fight child porn. And if it passes, I'm sure it will stop some of these bad guys. But the real criminals that the bill will want to stop will simply host their stuff overseas and outside the extradition laws. It's naive to think that McCain can even make a dent in this. It really goes to show you how clueless and technophobe that most Republicans are these days. (And I should know, because that's one of the things that frustrates me about being a Republican -- I can't relate to all the technophobes.)\r\n\r\nAlso, any USA Republican worth his own salt wouldn't be caught dead supporting McCain once they knew his principles, unless that Republican was a RINO (Republican In Name Only, aka \"super moderate\"). (BTW, I'm mostly a conservative Republican but am a freethinker as well.)","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166495198,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvau0","parent_id":"t3_vabv","author":"supermike","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808884,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37371-1682cc45-5272-4226-850d-aa1a9fda27b4-1566236772"}

{"body":"First, Hal Varian is a smart guy (engineered the Google IPO), so let's start by assuming he probably knows what he is talking about.\r\n\r\nSecond, I think common sense explains price dispersion - sure, he could have given a better explanation, but is it that hard to understand?  Retailers try and attract customers by lowering prices on certain items, and then offset this by keeping other items priced higher.  Which items they discount are different because\r\na) retailers are placing different bets on which products consumers want most\r\nb) retailers are paying slightly different prices for their inventories (driven by a number of factors e.g. scale, contracts, marketing incentives, geography, etc) which in turn means they won't all discount to the exact same level\r\nc) you have a rapidly-shifting product landscape\r\n\r\nThis is why price-comparison engines are useful (albeit not perfect yet).","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w2cf","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167209723,"score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"k0mplex","parent_id":"t1_cw2vh","edited":false,"id":"cw4qt","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809457,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52632-ea5afdbb-35a1-4222-8629-ecabe4d3106a-1566236778"}

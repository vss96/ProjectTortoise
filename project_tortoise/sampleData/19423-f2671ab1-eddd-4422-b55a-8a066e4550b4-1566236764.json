{"controversiality":0,"body":"BTW, and I'm sorry this is off-topic, but you should read how the Nazis worked with the Russians to take Poland. I was stunned and saddened when I read it and I wonder if this is where all the \"Dumb Polock\" jokes unfortunately started. Basically, the Nazis had already invaded a few other countries successfully, so then they came to invade Poland. The Germans started a fake skirmish by taking Jews, dressing them in German uniforms, and killing them near the border, blaming it on the Poles. They then invaded Poland. The Russians, meanwhile, had a secret pact. They came from the opposite side of the country and convinced the governors of the border towns that they had come to help defend the Poles. The Poles gleefully let the Russians in to fight the Germans. The Russians and Germans met in the center of Poland and to the surprise of the Poles, the Russians then turned their guns around and aimed at the best of the Polish army all lined up, ready to be executed. Then, the Russians and Germans easily toppled the country. The Poles had been tricked.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u9g8","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165715765,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"supermike","edited":false,"id":"cuace","parent_id":"t1_cuac0","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808198,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19423-f2671ab1-eddd-4422-b55a-8a066e4550b4-1566236764"}

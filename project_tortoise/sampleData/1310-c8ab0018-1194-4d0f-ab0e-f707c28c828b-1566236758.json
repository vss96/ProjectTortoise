Pierce, a well-known expert on the subject (professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, author of the book *Types and Programming Languages* and *Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages*) and asked what he thought about it.  His reply:\r\n\r\n&gt;I spent a few weeks, about a year ago, trying to sort out the terminology of \"strongly typed,\" \"statically typed,\" \"safe,\" etc., and found it amazingly difficult.  As your message points out, the usage of these terms is so various as to render them almost useless.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1164988024,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":24,"ups":24,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1310-c8ab0018-1194-4d0f-ab0e-f707c28c828b-1566236758"}

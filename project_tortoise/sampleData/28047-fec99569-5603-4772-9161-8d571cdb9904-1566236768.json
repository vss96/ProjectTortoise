I believe the \"You have to earn my respect\" thing started as a rebellious response to demands for this deference. In modern western society, nobody is generally thought to be entitled to this kind of respect anymore.\r\n\r\nTo others, it is the personal feelings of admiration towards another individual which we all sometimes feel. Personal feelings are not a matter for etiquette, so this kind of respect cannot be demanded, and I believe it's this form of respect which gave rise to the *wording* of \"You have to earn my respect.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, there's basic politeness; treating people respectfully. People who are being rude may end up saying \"You have to earn my respect\" if they are challenged on the basis of lack of respect, but I believe in this case people are talking at cross purposes; it's better to challenge those treating you disrespectfully on the basis that they're being rude.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28047-fec99569-5603-4772-9161-8d571cdb9904-1566236768"}

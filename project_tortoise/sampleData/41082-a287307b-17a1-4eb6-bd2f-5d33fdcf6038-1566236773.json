Trouble is, Windows has many, many of these weird idiosyncrasies.\r\n\r\nI prefer working with either Linux or OS X. Linux has many arcane and unusual ways of doing things, but each 'feature' is generally encapsulated in well documents tiny application files which can be piped together to accomplish very complex tasks quickly.\r\n\r\nOS X on the GUI level is just so incredibly smoothly designed you just forget about it (and discover new features when you need them - any additional overloaded functions for buttons are displayed if you hit the option button). It also has a unixy command line with all the linux goodness mentioned above.\r\n\r\nWindows just blows chunks no matter how you use it.\r\n\r\nEDIT: As an example of how to do this better, look at OS X. If it runs into an identical file while executing a batch copy, you're asked \"An item named xxx already exists at this location. Do you want to replace it with the one you're moving?\" [Don't Replace] [Stop] [Replace] plus a checkbox 'Apply to All'. It's quite obvious how to accomplish here what requires an arcane tip for Windows users to accomplish the same thing.","controversiality":0,"score":23,"ups":23,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166632658,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41082-a287307b-17a1-4eb6-bd2f-5d33fdcf6038-1566236773"}

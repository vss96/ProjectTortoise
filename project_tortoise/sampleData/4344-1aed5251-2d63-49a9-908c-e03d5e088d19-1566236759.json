We called them 'fifth columnists'. I don't believe making Muslims wear identifying marks is the answer. But you do need to be vigilant and report ANY suspicious behaviour.\r\n\r\nThat's not a solution.  If Americans reported all suspicious behavior to the authorities, those authorities would be literally buried in reports and the phone calls would crush the D.C. telephone system.  People are naturally suspicious, and the authorities have enough trouble ignoring all the U.F.O. abductees, getting phone calls about every turban-wearing Sikh in America would not help things.\r\n\r\n&gt; Better to be safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nBetter *free* than safe.  Americans are far more likely to die of a thousand random things than of terrorism.  We need to accept that life is full of risks and get on with it, fighting terrorism when possible *without* giving up our rights.  The \"war on terror\" isn't making us any safer, anyway, it's creating more and more enemies faster than we can defeat them.","controversiality":0,"score":18,"ups":18,"created_utc":1165114730,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctepr","parent_id":"t1_ctegf","author":"Codebender","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807606,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4344-1aed5251-2d63-49a9-908c-e03d5e088d19-1566236759"}

{"body":"&gt; Now, what do you suppose the plant's owner is going to do with the dollars he saved by hiring the illegal immigrant? Eat them?\r\n&gt; No, he's going to spend them, creating (you guessed it) new jobs.\r\n\r\nNeoclassical fantasy-land is such a fun place to live! In th' real world the plant owner will use as few workers as possible, skimp on workplace safety, forget about any kind of health insurance, worker's comp, or any other benefits, and pocket the rest. Illness, injury, or sickness comes along and *boom* that illegal worker is out and they pick up the next one that comes along.\r\n\r\nAt least until the government starts punishing the employers of illegal labor. The California fence-builders aside, not bloody likely anytime soon, especially if your trade group can afford to put a majority of Congress on retainer.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vpcj","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166894347,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"xinhoj","parent_id":"t1_cvq0t","edited":false,"id":"cvut4","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809270,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47438-3c23d62d-85fe-465b-ab19-735b96ef6123-1566236775"}

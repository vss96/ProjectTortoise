Simpson's trial was the \"trial of the century\". the media deals in superlatives, that's nothing new, and neither bill o'reilly nor his child advocate interviewee have any ownership of that. and an 8 year old saying something like \"i probably WOULD get medieval on his ass\"? and said with such confidence, and edited so professionally. i'd be willing to put money on it- i don't think she's responsible for the script. she might have a vague understanding of what it means, but i seriously doubt that any 8 year old can have a full comprehension of what she's saying. and you can't get around it- what she's saying IS incendiary, and i think that somebody is hiding behind her as a mouthpiece.\r\n\r\nON THE OTHER HAND - 8 year old kids are allowed to have speaking roles in R-rated movies where they swear- is that called child abuse? i doubt it. so while i'm not sure if i agree with the original ad, i can't say that the response was well thought out either.\r\n\r\nbill o'reilly is also a stooge for not coming out and accusing them of child abuse, but hiding behind his guest to say it for him. he then reels her in for going too far, as if he didn't know what she might say before she came on his show. she doesn't even have a credit- what organization is she with? bah.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u9s2","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808202,"author":"carpeliam","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuakt","parent_id":"t1_cuacb","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19573-c49452c5-b1cb-4c06-b0f7-cdd34daf18b6-1566236764"}

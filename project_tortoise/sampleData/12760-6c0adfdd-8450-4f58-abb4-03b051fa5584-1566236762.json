Especially if you're in a vehicle, since the vehicle is much easier to spot from afar. It also makes good immediate shelter.\r\n\r\nOther important thing to remember is to remain calm, clear-headed - or at least aware of your own mental state -  resting is also crucial, although you need to work to stay hydrated and warm at all time. \r\n\r\nA good survival mnemonic is: *Stay put and stay busy*. By working on something (shelter, fire, water, signals) you stay sharp and feel a sense of accomplishment - extremely important if stuck for prolonged durations, to alleviate hopelessness and mental fatigue.\r\n\r\nAll too often, people who get lost give up simply because they (irrationally) lose hope of being found, or wander off   \"looking for help\" because of restlessness and fatigue. A very bad idea, since you're shifting priorities from staying warm and hydrated to expending precious calories.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvxs","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807946,"author":"dln","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctwvx","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctw6n","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12760-6c0adfdd-8450-4f58-abb4-03b051fa5584-1566236762"}

A clever visual pun, no doubt but hardly worth anything more than a chuckle. If you have a deeper personal interest in the joke I could see it having a different value. e.g. if you're anti-Christian or just don't think they should take themselves so seriously it might be kind of a \"haha take that\" joke which may carry more humor to it I suppose. I just don't see how a clever pun could be the rolling on the floor type laughter I'm getting from some of these comments unless you have some baggage related to the issue itself.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t2am","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1164932385,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"57-86530206-ba1c-48e8-b937-71a13fc2d1e1-1566236758"}

{"body":"No. I'm dismissing the article based on its content and citing the title as further evidence that the article itself is garbage. \r\n\r\nIs there blatant media bias approved and encouraged in mass media at the corporate level? Absolutely.\r\n\r\nStart here for background on this.\r\n\r\nhttp://mediamatters.org/\r\n\r\nIs the article discussing media bias? No. It is citing an NBER study that claim if there is such a thing its being done to cater to the news market of the reporter, which is bull.\r\n\r\n&gt;The data suggest that newspapers are targeting their political slant to their customersâ€™ demand and choosing the amount of slant that will maximize their sales. \r\n\r\nAnd yet newspaper circulation is down and dropping indicating that this slant is in fact not selling more papers. The correlations found in the study are garbage. \r\n\r\nThe bias in newspapers are real and they are serving corporate interest, stated or unstated by the owners.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u1yd","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165562184,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"smacfarl","edited":false,"id":"cu32n","parent_id":"t1_cu202","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808060,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15538-1787c351-3b62-44fc-acea-81d792b7228d-1566236762"}

I really like how php is \"laid back,\" In that, I dont have to extensively analyze a piece of code to see whats wrong. Usually, what you ask it to do, it will do. Plus, knocking together a page with inline php is like a cakewalk.\r\n\r\nMaybe im just too stubborn? If anyone can point me towards something that will give me that epiphany, I welcome it.","retrieved_on":1473809374,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw0b6","id":"cw0bu","author_flair_text":null,"author":"treetree888","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50181-449e8a02-1461-48c6-b07d-1d347d67da13-1566236778"}

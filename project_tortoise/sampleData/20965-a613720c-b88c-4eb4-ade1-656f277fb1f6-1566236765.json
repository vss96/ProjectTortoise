The beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints hold that a man can only be sealed to one woman (though as many woman as necessary can be sealed to a man as a temporary measure that only lasts as long as they're alive, I don't know how God lines up couples in Heaven, but I'm sure he has a working system).  God only has one wife, and through the doctrine that married men can become like God, we extrapolate that God went through the same process that we did.  This video states that God was born from one of the many wives of his God, which is blatantly false.\r\nIf you're going to bash polygamy, do it right!

I think that jails should be horrible places to be so that you don't want to go there.\r\n\r\nSo no, you don't agree with torture, but you do think it's a good thing overall? I'd say in that case that you *do* agree with it, but perhaps you find it distasteful.\r\n\r\nYou're also sidestepping the real question, which is that we live in a society where the presumption of innocence is important. Since you're presuming the guy may be innocent (he hasn't been charged, much less convicted with anything), is it still okay to torture him to try and find out whether he is in fact innocent or guilty? (which is ridiculous anyway, because evidence gained by torture is unreliable at *best*)","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vcii","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808975,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"cecilkorik","id":"cvfm4","parent_id":"t1_cve8x","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39794-1a696098-8227-4f88-9cc2-ea88e477be0a-1566236773"}

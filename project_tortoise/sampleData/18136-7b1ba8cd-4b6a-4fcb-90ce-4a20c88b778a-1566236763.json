It is illegal to leave the road to pass; that is, it is illegal to use a shoulder to pass, which is the origin of this \"don't pass on the right\" saying.  If there are two lanes, there's no law being broken if the car in the right lane travels faster than the one in the left.  In most states, however, there will be a regulation or recommendation for slower traffic to move right.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u62g","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1165653324,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"18136-7b1ba8cd-4b6a-4fcb-90ce-4a20c88b778a-1566236763"}

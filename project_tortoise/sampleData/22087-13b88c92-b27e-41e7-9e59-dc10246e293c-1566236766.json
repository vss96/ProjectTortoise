Ordinarily people who are lactose intolerant wouldn't have a problem, however after the gene switches off bacteria in the digestive tract switch to digesting lactose due to it being a rich food source compared to what they usually get, this then means you get wind and discomfort from the bacteria digesting it.\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend is lactose intolerant, but she's been drinking small amounts for a long time in tea and coffee that don't effect her and now she appears to be becoming lactose tolerant. She occasionally feels like drinking milk and doesn't get any of the side effects anymore.\r\n\r\nInteresting point on the milk drinking, getting a lower fat milk means you can get through an entire imperial gallon and not the pitiful US gallon.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808291,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cuf9d","parent_id":"t1_cueee","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22087-13b88c92-b27e-41e7-9e59-dc10246e293c-1566236766"}

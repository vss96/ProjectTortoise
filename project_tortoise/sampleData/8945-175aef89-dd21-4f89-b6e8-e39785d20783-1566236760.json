Suprised it hasnt been considered here before now. In Argentina, for example, the long distance bus network is cheap and very comfortable with almost flat beds in coche-cama class, on board meals, tea, coffee, video, plus a evening meal break with silver service waiters at a special bus resteraunt station on the trunk road all included. Price also includes champagne and brandy. I kid you not. Total cost for Buenos Aires to Iguazu, a journey of 24 hours (approx 2000km), AR$100 which is about Â£16 or US$32.

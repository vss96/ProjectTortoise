Originally they used to be quite accepted and safe, especially in the UKs dock areas and heck they were even considered an asset to the Royal Navy, because they helped keep the men happy without them getting tied down with a relationship at home.\r\n\r\nThen in the early stages of the US they were able to run brothels and get equal, if not better, protection than anyone else living in a town. Ironic that in one of the most uncivilised areas, they were best protected.\r\n\r\nNow we've had the era of 'free-love' and everyone supposedly has 'human rights', but we have prostitutes being murdered on the street in a fucking coppy-cat killing of Jack the Ripper. There was 5 confirmed killings, and we currently have 5 dead bodies. The person who did it has now likely gone underground and quite frankly could easily be out of the country.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v3qa","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808765,"author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv4hs","parent_id":"t3_v3qa","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34110-5767a666-aecf-4296-aec3-1c4ca7cffc23-1566236771"}

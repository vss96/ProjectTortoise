Really.  I mean, I've been against it from the time it was brought up; how one can operate a world where it is okay for one country to unilateraly invade another for any particular reason is really screwed up.  All the reasons I've heard: the lies of the White House, oil, the idea of making a power play and flexing our muscles in a region, strategic location, they all seem really weak to me.  I mean, even if you throw out any ideas of morality or ethics, the Wolfowitz/Rumsefeld war strategy never seemed to make much sense to me.  Far too much expense for far, far too little reward.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19122-59f1e4c0-4a94-4bc2-87c0-ec89ea2d90b3-1566236764"}

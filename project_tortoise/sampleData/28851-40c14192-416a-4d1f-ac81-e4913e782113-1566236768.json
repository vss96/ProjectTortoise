Well, we're each entitled to our opinion.  Or at least, I'm entitled to my opinion and you're entitled to your name-calling.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uqkr","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808552,"distinguished":null,"author":"emc2rae","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cus6e","edited":false,"id":"cuta0","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28851-40c14192-416a-4d1f-ac81-e4913e782113-1566236768"}

I gave up trying to use Haskell for database backed webapps (even though WASH *is* really cool), because it was just too painful.  For compilers and interpreters, though, almost everything is \"batteries included\", and I rarely find myself having to define things outside the problem domain.  I think this may be a symptom of \"The only major app written in it is the compiler\"-itis.  (Well, darcs too, but you still see Haskell used way more for compilers and compiler-like problems than anything stateful.)","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_twtt","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13729-7547e14b-7798-4642-8469-235cba3c9a37-1566236762"}

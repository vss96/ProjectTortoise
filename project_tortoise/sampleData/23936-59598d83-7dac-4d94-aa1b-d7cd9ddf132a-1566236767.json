{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ufsk","subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"I'm a Graham fan, but I have a lot of problems with this essay.\r\n\r\nI don't agree that Graham has demonstrated the objectivity of taste--even if we accept his definition of \"good\" art as that which appeals to \"people who (a) are hard to trick, and (b) don't just like whatever they grew up with,\" it's merely asserted, not argued, that such people would reach a consensus. I, for one, am skeptical.\r\n\r\nBut I don't mind disagreeing about that old chestnut. Here are the things that bug me:\r\n\r\n\"If there's no such thing as [objectively] better, it doesn't matter what you do.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I make art (music, in my case), I make it as good as I can _to my taste_, because I have no interest in making something that I don't like. Its hypothetical objective quality is completely irrelevant to this.\r\n\r\nSo, what I do matters to _me_. I don't much care whether it matters to God or Plato.\r\n\r\n\"The other reason [subjectivity of taste is] easy to believe is that it makes people feel good.\"\r\n\r\nExactly the same could be said of the objectivity of taste: it's easy to believe because it makes people feel good to be one of the blessed, superior few with truly good taste. Certainly the latter appealed much more to me when I was a kid, and it took me a while to unlearn it (if indeed I have).\r\n\r\nThere's an asymmetry here that I think Graham is missing, and it's odd, because it's exactly the same as an old code maxim: be generous in what you read, but strict with what you write. In art terms:\r\n\r\n--Consume art as sympathetically as possible. Try to find a way to see something good in it. In particular, don't worry about whether the artist \"cheated\" or not; if you get pleasure of something he despises, the joke's on him.\r\n\r\n--Make art as ruthlessly as possible. Have standards, do your best to live up to them, and don't do things out of laziness.\r\n\r\nI find this much more rewarding than worrying about whether object X is \"really\" better than object Y. But of course, that's a matter of taste.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165893541,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuiqz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ufsk","author_flair_text":null,"author":"rutabaga","retrieved_on":1473808357,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23936-59598d83-7dac-4d94-aa1b-d7cd9ddf132a-1566236767"}

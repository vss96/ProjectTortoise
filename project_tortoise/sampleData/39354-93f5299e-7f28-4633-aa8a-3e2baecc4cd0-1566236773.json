Politicians don't talk about these problems, and the MSM prefers to report on Britney Spears' panties.  Without an informed citizenry holding Congress and President's feet to fire on serious, long-term, beyond the next election cycle issues, well we get what we've gotten.\r\n\r\nWe can also throw some blame on religious fundamentalism, which trains/indoctrinates/brainwashes its members from a young age to think irrationallly so that many grow up without an extensive understanding of how the modern world works, and a sense of misplaced priorities when it comes to running a country.\r\n\r\nWe were heading this direction anyway, but with time there was still some hope for repairing the damage.  I think the damage wrought by this administration and the 109th Congress may have erased any time we had left, now all we can hope for is a soft landing and a good Mandarin tutor.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_ve7i","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166563680,"score":6,"ups":6,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39354-93f5299e-7f28-4633-aa8a-3e2baecc4cd0-1566236773"}

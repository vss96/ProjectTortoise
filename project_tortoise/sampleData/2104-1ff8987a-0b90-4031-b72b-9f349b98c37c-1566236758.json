For speech that makes you blood boil and turns your stomach. For speech that you think is dangerous, and subversive, and beyond the pale.\r\n\r\nBecause popular speech doesn't *need* protection. \r\n\r\nBut unpopular speech does. And we need unpopular speech. Because without it, we are not free to question our basic assumptions, to check ourselves, to change our minds. Without it, we fall prey to groupthink, and our ideas lose their relevance, their connection to reality, as we disappear into our own navels. \r\n\r\nWe *need* unpopular speech. Because all unpopular speech boils down to one statement, one idea. And it goes like this:\r\n\r\n\"Hey, that idea you cherish, that thing you think, or want to think, is a universal truth? Yeah, it's wrong.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if you can't handle hearing that, if your ideas can't stand on their own merits, then you, my friend, need to check yourself, because you are lost.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2104-1ff8987a-0b90-4031-b72b-9f349b98c37c-1566236758"}

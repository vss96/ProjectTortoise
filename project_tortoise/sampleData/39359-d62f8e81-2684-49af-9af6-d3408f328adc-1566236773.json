It feels a bit like by not managing the problem more sooner, and if one desird less federal gov't, one way to do that might be to allow the debt to continue to build as it has been?\r\n\r\nBut if the issue of reducing the debt would start to be tackled sooner, then the state of the federal government and many programs as we have today ought to last longer? or any reductions are somewhat alleviated.\r\n\r\nAlso shouldn't many problems start to alleviate as the big bump of the boomer generation starts to pass on after say 20 - 30 years? So the government needs a prudent enough plan also taking into account smoothing out the demographic wave over that time?\r\n\r\nAnyways...","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39359-d62f8e81-2684-49af-9af6-d3408f328adc-1566236773"}

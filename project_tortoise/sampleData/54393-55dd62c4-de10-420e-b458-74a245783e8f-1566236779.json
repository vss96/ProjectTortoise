Were the suspects to be charged with poaching -- or with some other crime hinging upon their action of firing the gun, which was incited by the police -- it would be every bit as unethical as the techniques used for prostitution busts.\r\n\r\nThey aren't being charged with a crime like that, though, so the question is academic.\r\n\r\nBut were that the case, I wouldn't see the difference between that tactic and an undercover cop posing as a prostitute. The status of the perpetrator as an \"asshole redneck\" has no bearing on the question whatsoever. Nor does the efficacy of the tactic, nor any benefit to society provided by the capture or deterrence of potential poachers. In both cases, the police arrange a situation which incites someone to commit a crime, and then arrest them for it. The situations are pretty much isomorphic.\r\n\r\nBut to reiterate: I don't have a real problem with the tactic as it is employed.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w3b1","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167282951,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54393-55dd62c4-de10-420e-b458-74a245783e8f-1566236779"}

And I know both of your workarounds for Ruby's quirks. That's just my point.\r\n\r\nIn Python you type (1000).callmethod(). That's a fairly harmless quirk.\r\n\r\nIn Ruby you type proc.call() instead of proc(). That's also a fairly harmless quirk, though it hampers a functional style of programming.\r\n\r\nIt is frankly only idiots that make big deals about these quirks. Certain things will be slightly more verbose in one language and others slightly more verbose in another.\r\n\r\nThe thing that I think is borked is to allow the definition of a function/method/whatever in a context and not give access to the bindings in the containing scopes. What benefit is there to disallowing access to these variables?","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_u2mr","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19270-7709c441-c2b2-4f02-8197-92b0b04e66ca-1566236764"}

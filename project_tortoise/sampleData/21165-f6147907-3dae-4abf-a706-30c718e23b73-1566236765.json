{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ud3c","body":"Did the fourteen day one a few weeks ago with my girlfriend and when I actually got back to my computer I couldn't stand it, I wanted to get away from it again. Next summer we're aiming for 28 days, thankfully her family loves me and my parents have just got a place in France. I've offered to help fix it up and do the electrics, plus figure out how to take out a 3 foot wall without designing a nuclear powered drill.\r\n\r\nSo I'm figuring I could muster more time, heck I work with my dad (he's family so I can't kill him unlike any other wouldbe coworker) so I can blackmail him or get my mum to do it. I think a 2 month computer free vacation would do me good, however it would be a bitch to automate my site with two months worth of updates without checking back up on it. I'd probably have to take down an emergancy laptop to france with me anyway.\r\n\r\nNo wonder India is a buldgeoning economy, we in the west can't wait to escape work. I'm as close to my birth as I am my midlife crisis and I already have work and coworker apathy.","controversiality":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165799036,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cudm9","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cudck","author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808259,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21165-f6147907-3dae-4abf-a706-30c718e23b73-1566236765"}

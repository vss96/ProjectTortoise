Before that ruling, police had to announce themselves before entering a home with a search warrant. If they failed to do this, any criminal evidence they found would not be usable in court.\r\n\r\n*Hudson* was a case where police didn't announce themselves properly, but found drugs in the home being searched. The SCOTUS ruled that the evidence was still usable in court. \r\n\r\nThus, the only bar to ignoring the \"knock and announce\" rule (that evidence found without knocking and announcing would be thrown out) is gone.\r\n\r\nSo the use of kick-in-the-door,  charge-in-with-guns-drawn and damn-the-Constitution tactics will increase. \r\n\r\nI'm sure the police would tell us that those raids are safer, and they are -- safer for the police. It really is a \"shoot first and ask questions later\" kind of policy. Which is why it *used* to be employed only in hostage situations and high-risk drug raids and the like. But not anymore. \r\n\r\nSo much for \"to protect and serve.\"\r\n\r\nNow we are all at risk of this kind of thing happening, just for living next door to a *suspected* criminal.\r\n\r\nWoo-hoo.

If you haven't notice, Padilla charges have been dropped. Allegedly, he was guilty of trying to build a radiological bomb, but this fabrication by the government was later dropped.\r\n\r\nI suspect that Padilla will be exonerated of all his 'enemy combatant' charges eventually. I doubt at this point (especially after all this time) that there ever was anything to these charges.\r\n\r\nBut his isolation and his treatment reveals the nature of the Beast and what this Administration thinks of when it decides to target Americans.  Padilla's case is ground-breaking because it both demonstrates and proves the President's position and power.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807711,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctj4l","edited":false,"id":"ctkah","author":"lifeofliberty","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6716-a1a0f2ce-2250-4bd1-ac9d-873bdc050efd-1566236760"}

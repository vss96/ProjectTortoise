Yes I do smoke (The monkey is not related to that however)\r\n\r\nTake for example my position on illegal drug use, I believe they should be legalized but I would never consider using them.\r\n\r\nThe point I was trying to make is that it should be up to the owner of the PRIVATE business. If it turned out that everywhere banned smoking by the choice of the business owner, then I couldn't be happier because the decision would be made by the right person.\r\n\r\nAlso it would not stop the few businesses that cater almost exclusively to smokers from operating, such as a smokers lounge or a gentlemens club where typically smokers hang out and smoke ciggerettes and/or cigars and have done previously without complaint. The worst case should be that these places should be able to apply for a permit, but a choice like that should really not require legislation.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vs7p","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809558,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"skepathetarian","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvwlj","id":"cwa2g","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55366-51b9f9ca-e38e-48b1-95da-2a3c93b32585-1566236779"}

{"body":"Yah we joke about them, but at the same time we respect them and sympathize them. This is normal and healthy human behaviour to the things that are unusual. But we let them live their lives and thats the most important thing. I dont know how many countries will include trans in their national entourage to such prestegious athletic events. It shows that we do give them a chance to be themselves, despite making fun of them. But then, you will find, that we make fun of women, and muslims, and christians, and sikhs and blacks and whites and about ourselves. I think jokes are ok. and actually should be encouraged, as they are part of the process of bringing information about them and bringing them closer and building relationship. The problem starts when become voilent towards them and dont give them a chance to live and do things their own way. Democracy is not about not making fun of black people, but according them an equal chance to be what they want to be.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vn5g","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166767500,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvpzj","id":"cvq0s","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809178,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45026-6e97ac39-92d6-429a-b1aa-61fa1ae28eaf-1566236774"}

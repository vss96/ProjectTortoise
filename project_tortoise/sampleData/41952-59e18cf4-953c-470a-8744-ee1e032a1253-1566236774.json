{"body":"Hey, I'm not even close to arguing the point about libraries. Good libraries make developing in _any_ language more pleasant. I'll agree on good tools, too, even though I suspect you and I mean different things when we say that. My idea of a good tool set is a read-eval-print-loop shell, real-time object inspection &amp; modification, and hopefully an intelligent approach to macros. \r\n\r\n&gt; So far I have not seen anything disruptive enough to dethrone Java from its spot.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the problem is that many of the suggested alternatives are _too_ disruptive. The differences between C and C++ were fairly small. The differences between C++ and Java were small. However, Smalltalk, Haskell, Ruby, and LISP may as well be from different planets when you compare them to C/C++/Java. The mass corporate shifts have been incremental (as far as my limited knowledge of corporate IT history can tell), and they will probably continue to be incremental. No middle manager is going to risk his job over a major language shift when there is so much invested in the way things are already done.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vh74","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166653207,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"brianwisti","parent_id":"t1_cvjou","id":"cvjva","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809060,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41952-59e18cf4-953c-470a-8744-ee1e032a1253-1566236774"}

I was failing classes my whole life. From second grade on I failed more classes than I passed. Then I'd take the Iowa Basics Test and score in the 99th percentile and everyone was puzzled including my parents. I always got this one, \"What's wrong with you?\" I don't know what was wrong. I was accused of being lazy, but until the 8th grade I really wanted to do well. I just couldn't. That's the only way I can explain it. I just couldn't get myself to perform in school. In my article I linked to an essay by Josh Shaine from MIT that had a similar experience. His story was almost identical. I suppose today they'd drug me.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ut1n","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166200156,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30737-a946598a-8214-4980-b3e3-4f0c86d79542-1566236769"}

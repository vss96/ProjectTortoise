This makes brute-forcing difficult, but is trivial and quick for a human (with normal vision) to solve. \r\n\r\nThat still leaves the question of what to do for hearing impaired individuals. Maybe you could have a randomly-generated sound sequence, with questions like \"did you hear a bird chirp?\" and \"did you hear a dog bark?\" and \"was there a siren in the background?\"","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ujbj","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808415,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"frankus","parent_id":"t3_ujbj","id":"culuk","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25371-687a2845-71f7-4dd5-ad66-707793629f53-1566236767"}

First, being logically inconsistent is not a crime by itself (although it might help to become a lousy criminal). Then, being gay in most of the US might be tough enough to traumatize some people into irrationality; having Cheney as a dad, even more so; but cumulating both challenges as a single person is enough to turn most people just plain nuts, so I think she's doing great.\r\n\r\nBesides, suppose for a minute that she's doing all this rationally, that she's advancing the famous \"homosexual agenda\". She's forcing her father to more-or-less publicly support her actions, by trapping him between family values and homophobic values. By doing so, she's seriously underminig the GOP's homophobic discourse.\r\n\r\nImagine that she did the opposite, and frontally clashed with dad, and bitched on him in liberal newspapers, that'd be easy for him: he'd played the wounded father, who loves his lost daughter although this love is nonreciprocating, and disapprove of both her family-breaking and sexual choices.","score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1165417885,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11520-4cd3f58a-763f-4780-9593-7f66cf2c3789-1566236761"}

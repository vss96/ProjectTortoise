As I started to take higher level classes, I sort of turned into the Silent Foreign Curve Destroyer and the Professor Corrector.  Hey, it's not my fault that every body else doesn't do well in the class.  Also, the Prof's got a PhD and tenure.  He'd better know his stuff and teach it correctly!  Especially undergrad material - that should be easy.  Anyway, I finally outgrew the urge to correct mistakes like 85% vs. 90%.  But substantive errors need to be pointed out.  We're paying a lot of these classes so we have the right to demand a good effort.\r\n\r\nEmbrace the stereotype. :)","controversiality":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166071455,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuqaf","parent_id":"t3_up24","edited":false,"author":"mleonhard","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808498,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27467-142c3b7a-977f-48a7-a704-b1d3087630e9-1566236768"}

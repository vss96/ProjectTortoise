This decision led to disappointment in the Linux community, with some people feeling that Adobe has abandoned the Linux market. Increasingly, websites insist on the use of newer players, which weakens Adobe's claim that their Flash Player is \"Linux compatible.\" Linux users seeking to upgrade to Flash Player 8 are instead redirected to a download page for Flash Player 7.","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26643-b7eda359-d271-4a0e-b759-46a4867abf73-1566236767"}

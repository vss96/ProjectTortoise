I’ll quote it for you here: \r\n\r\n&gt; John C. Green, a senior fellow at the Pew Forum, said he was surprised to see that teaching both evolution and creationism was favored not only by conservative Christians, but also by majorities of secular respondents, liberal Democrats and those who accept the theory of natural selection. Mr. Green called it a reflection of \"American pragmatism.\"\r\n&gt;\"It's like they're saying, 'Some people see it this way, some see it that way, so just teach it all and let the kids figure it out.' It seems like a nice compromise, but it infuriates both the creationists and the scientists,\" said Mr. Green, who is also a professor at the University of Akron in Ohio. \r\n\r\nClearly neither of those sources actually says that “half the United States populace thinks the earth is 6000 years old” which is what both you and the op ed author are insinuating.  Rather it just goes to show that Americans are willing to allow moral teachings to bleed into even the sciences if popular support for said teachings exists.  While you can be critical of this aspect of “American Pragmatism” as your own article puts simply saying that half of the US believes the earth is 6000 years old is clearly wrong.\r\n[Here is a link to the actual NYTimes article if you want to check it out]( http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/31/national/31religion.html?ex=1283140800&amp;en=39489e707718912f&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss)\r\n","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165355269,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9967-b102eb61-3a66-4857-8547-9ffa0686283d-1566236761"}

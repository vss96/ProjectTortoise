But, what about simple and KISS? They took that model and batted it out of the park, now they have millions of developers. Is it because they need millions of developers to solve the problems or is it just because it is a language that you can work with regardless of your skillset and still produce some kind of software.\r\n\r\nRight. But personally, I've decided that I won't spend a single minute of my free time on Java stuff. The price for using all those Java libraries is high. Java is so fucking underpowered in expressivenss. One of the results is, that when in another language you'd use an embedded DSL (getting the power of the language + DSL), the Java monkeys regularly come up with an even more underpowered DSL in XML (one example is ant, but there are many more). And you are expected to find it great simply because it's XML.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29336-6a8ae8b7-cf88-4915-9668-0868c35f5356-1566236769"}

{"body":"Don't worry, the rich people who don't invest become poor. Coincidentally they also do that by giving money back to you. They just don't give it back to you in the form of capital investments. Also, interestingly unless the rich themselves are looters (which I don't think most of them are) they got rich by providing the public (ie you) with a service it wanted. Of course the government doesn't have to worry about that. It can take money directly from you without providing much of a service at all.","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_tour","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165373100,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"djwhitt","id":"cts7n","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cts6f","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807859,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10552-08d26508-308f-4c8e-9008-e85fa30df94a-1566236761"}

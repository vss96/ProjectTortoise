I'd say I'd be less likely to take advice on public food-safety from a guy that got a heart-attack. He's liable to have a vested interest and little expertise.\r\n\r\nLet the experts give expert-advice, not the victims.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165411948,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ttgg","id":"ctty9","author":"masterdirk","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807891,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11368-1bf33027-22d7-419b-a108-d03bbf508587-1566236761"}

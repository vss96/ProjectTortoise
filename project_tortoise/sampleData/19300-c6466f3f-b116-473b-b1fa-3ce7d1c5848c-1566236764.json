If I had to guess, I'd say few of my friends have this kind of uncompromising attitude to being given (or giving) a traditional diamond ring.\r\n\r\nMany people like to tout female stereotypes as being near-universal, and to dismiss women who don't fit the stereotype as freakish outliers who shouldn't count (if not completely mythological entities, because they've never met any).\r\n\r\nI'd like to know the actual statistics behind attitudes to engagement rings, by gender and geographical location.  I'm sure they're still quite *popular*, but I doubt that they are as omnipresent as they were a few decades ago, for the simple reason that there are more working women around today than there were a few decades ago.\r\n\r\nAt least some of them are likely to have a more egalitarian approach to partners in a relationship spending money on each other, and not to buy into the traditional rituals of men spending money on women to impress them.  But it really depends on how they were brought up.","controversiality":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165710952,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19300-c6466f3f-b116-473b-b1fa-3ce7d1c5848c-1566236764"}

There are basically three ways out of the trap.\r\n\r\nEven if we weren't diverse and fragmented, ahow do we do this in a free society where individual oddballs can do their own thing? \r\n\r\nSuppose we were able to get 95%, 99%, or even 99.9% of Muslims in the USA or Europe to conform, would that be enough? Probably not. The media and the public would still focus on the ones that were perceived to be disloyal, threatening, or distinct. \r\n\r\nEven though there are fewer than 100 women in the Netherlands who wear the veil, that's the image of Muslim women that prevails, provoking proposals for a ban on the veil.\r\n\r\nThe images that the majority have about the \"subgroup\" are dominated by the odd ones. We can say \"the vast majority of us aren't like that\" until we're blue in the face. That meme has no traction. \r\n\r\nMuslim leaders denounce and condemn terrorism and terrorists every day. They haven't received much attention in the Western media.\r\n\r\nDo you have suggestions for increasing the virality of the \"Muslims Leaders Condemn Terrorism\" meme?","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tdgp","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37240-471d52f8-8526-4bf3-8cfc-0adc8b495ba7-1566236772"}

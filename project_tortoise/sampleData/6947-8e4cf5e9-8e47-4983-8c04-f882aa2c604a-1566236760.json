{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tivn","body":"There's a distinction that's too often lost, but is nevertheless an important one - we really need a third category between \"agnosticism\" and \"atheism\", because most people don't understand (or even know) the two flavors of atheism, \"weak\" and \"strong\", characterized by how you state it:\r\n\r\nWeak: I don't believe there is a God\r\nStrong: I believe there is no God.\r\n\r\nThere are very, very few atheists that actually take the strong position - asserting the nonexistence of something is after all a very logically difficult position to prove.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile weak atheism is usually confused with agnosticism - but they're not the same. Saying that \"I don't believe a God exists but it's possible\" is not the same thing as stating \"I can't know if a God exists\". True agnosticism puts God outside the reach of science, saying that there's no test we could construct to verify his existence or not. Weak atheism leaves God within the realm of science, and makes him roughly equivalent to ether or the caloric theory of heat - God is a victim of Occam's Razor.\r\n\r\nMost self-described agnostics I've met are actually weak atheists. Most self-described atheists I've met are weak atheists. True agnosticism and strong atheism are both relatively rare positions.","controversiality":0,"score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1165253369,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctksd","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctkit","author":"ejp1082","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807721,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6947-8e4cf5e9-8e47-4983-8c04-f882aa2c604a-1566236760"}

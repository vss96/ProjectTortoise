Other debuggers I've used have been pretty awful, meaning they often don't do anything at all.\r\n\r\n&gt;Usually it is a lot faster to just use print statements or some equivalent to narrow down the location of the first point where the data doesn't match the expectations... It also means your program will run at full speed.\r\n\r\nIn C/C++, assert() is even better. It's one of the simplest, most useful, and under-used tools in the toolbox. But both assert() and simple print-dumps slow a program down. For a desktop or network server application, the slowdown is probably insignificant; for a hardware driver or an embedded application, it may be fatal.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167250431,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53613-7dd1db3b-400f-429b-81ab-f57697662a97-1566236778"}

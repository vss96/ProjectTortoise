(spuur picks right up on that theme with his/her own head. why not just write 'google maps kim killer!'?) the last few paragraphs note how popular the kim saga had been to readers of the publisher's site, even crassly listing page views, and it's hard for me not to think the story angle was just an effort to scare up a few more ad impressions on the back of a tragedy (\"in a related story...\"). ironically, i think the topic is an important one and worth debating, but this pub went about it in the wrong way.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165598478,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":7,"ups":7,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16397-7bda1c45-5fcc-433f-9f5f-1826160a8a57-1566236763"}

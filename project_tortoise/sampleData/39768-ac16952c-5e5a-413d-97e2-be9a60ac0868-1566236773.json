I'm no economist, but I wonder how that bodes for NZ if the US economy sinks even further.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, if you're under 30, you can get a two year work permit to NZ pretty easily (it's more a matter of having enough $$ in the bank to support yourself in the initial weeks/months of moving there if you don't have a secure job offer).  Once there, with a job, it's much easier to apply for residency.  Try that route if you don't think you will qualify under the skilled migrant category linked by melechric.  (one organization who can help you get that work visa - for a fee - is BUNAC.  Several people I know used them to work in NZ, and I used them to get my initial work visa to the US)","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vc4j","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39768-ac16952c-5e5a-413d-97e2-be9a60ac0868-1566236773"}

Gold has many uses and the price fluctuates with the demand for those uses now a days, not based upon the value of currency. There is no such thing as an objective, stable store of value because value is neither objective, nor stable. Moving off of the gold standard was an incredibly important and positive move for the economy. Since moving off of the gold standard, which allows the central bank more flexibility, our business cycles have been much less intense, with shorter, shallower troughs. Gold bugs can get lucky in their investments in gold, just like any speculator can, but their attempts to move us back onto the gold standard are short-sighted.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tkec","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807749,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_ctlqe","edited":false,"id":"ctmcb","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7743-565f6c1d-95cd-45c6-9809-8a36d2fa6c58-1566236760"}

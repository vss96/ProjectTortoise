The thing that is limiting Iran is not a lack of reserves but the ability to maintain oil extracting infrastructure. But this is remedied by the technical cooperation of China and Russia who both can do this.\r\n\r\nMore important in the Saudi Washington Post op-ed cited in the article was the statement by Nawaf Obaid\r\n\r\n&gt;[Another possibility includes the establishment of new Sunni brigades to combat the Iranian-backed militias. Finally, Abdullah may decide to strangle Iranian funding of the militias through oil policy. **If Saudi Arabia boosted production and cut the price of oil in half,** the kingdom could still finance its current spending. But it would be devastating to Iran, which is facing economic difficulties even with today's high prices. The result would be to limit Tehran's ability to continue funneling hundreds of millions each year to Shiite militias in Iraq and elsewhere.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/28/AR2006112801277.html)\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia is going to *boost* output to combat Iran, this will hurt Iran and the US elite interest (Bush/Cheney base). The main statements in the Asia times article are nonsense other than the re-introduction of the Kissinger theory of middle east management, which is to fuel a war between the Shia and Sunni. See Iraq-Iran wars 30+ years ago. \r\n\r\nIran is not nearly in the population trouble that the article pretends it to be in. You'll note that the author of the article is \"Spengler\", which is a pseudonym for the Asia times punditry that advocates the very gloomy and inaccurate [Oswald Spengler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Spengler) global analysis as encapsulated in the *Decline of the West*.\r\n\r\nIran like any other power is attempting to expand its influence within the region and the Saudis are trying to prevent this, its that simple. Ultimately it is the other regional power, Israel, that profits from this type of conflict much as France did when Germany was at war with itself.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13701-e8c9a442-d04e-42ea-bcc0-f677d7370191-1566236762"}

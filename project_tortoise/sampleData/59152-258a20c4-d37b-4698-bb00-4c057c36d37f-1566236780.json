I wrote the linked article.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments, but I'd like to specifically respond to oreng, who said:\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the reactionist manifesto of a psychiatric practitioner scorned. The writer seems to be directing his criticism towards certain colleagues (Or archetypes of colleagues, as the case may be), rather than at the entire professional corpus of the discipline...\r\n\r\nI have to tell you, I think he's right.  I haven't been scorned, the professional life is so far ok, but there is an \"oedipal\" component to the post;  I didn't do it consciously, but now I see that I was certainly reacting simply to the status quo _only_ because it was the status quo-- the way a teenager rebels against his parents.\r\n\r\nI stand behind everything I wrote.  But I bring this up here for two reasons: one, to think out loud about how our own psychologies affect what we think and notice.  Second, to reinforce that discussions like these in reddit, metafilter, etc, aren't idle chatter, they definitely broaden your understanding of issues.  It's possible that I would eventually have understood this about myself, but seeing it here accelerated the process.  We need more of this, especially in politics.\r\n\r\nDoes EVERYONE hate white on black background?  Would simply enlarging the font help?\r\n\r\nhttp://thelastpsychiatrist.com","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vzcs","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","created_utc":1167516887,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59152-258a20c4-d37b-4698-bb00-4c057c36d37f-1566236780"}

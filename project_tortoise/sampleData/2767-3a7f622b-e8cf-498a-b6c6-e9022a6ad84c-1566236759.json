F# is a dialect of OCaml (which is, in turn, from the ML family of languages).\r\n\r\nF# shares a significant subset of OCaml's core language. F# lacks some of OCaml's more experimental features, like polymorphic variants, structural subtyping, optional and labelled arguments but F# also has some new features, like nominal subtyping, active patterns, comprehensions, operator overloading and really easy interfacing to other languages (even C).\r\n\r\nI've just started translating a 50kLOC project (Presenta) from OCaml/OpenGL to F#/DirectX. After two days I've done 15kLOC and have a demo running. This ease of translation opens up a lot of interesting OCaml code for .NET...\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2767-3a7f622b-e8cf-498a-b6c6-e9022a6ad84c-1566236759"}

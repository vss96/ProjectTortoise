It turned out that the extension worked, but was slower than a hand written CPython implementation and in some cases slower than the interpreted Python version.  I'd guess that the performance would be better now than when he tried it 6 months ago (especially with the JIT compiler now).  You can read his brief writeup [here](http://lentejasverdes.ath.cx/stuff/pypy/europython_2006/README.html) and a little more of an overview [here](http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-dev/2006q3/003339.html).\r\n\r\nMy guess is very soon now you'll be able to use pypy to write Python code (or something similar, like RPython), and have it compiled to fast C code.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808242,"gilded":0,"id":"cucnv","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cucgc","author_flair_text":null,"author":"lost-theory","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20620-90f20d22-3487-4e69-baff-87afa1b17779-1566236765"}

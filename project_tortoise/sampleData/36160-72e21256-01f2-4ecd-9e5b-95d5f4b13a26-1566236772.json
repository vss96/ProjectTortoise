But why is it religion frequently tries to take credit for the goodness in the world? Often it is argued that without religion, we would all be murderers and rapists. You can't have it both ways, either you are responsible for the good and the evil, or you are responsible for neither. \r\n\r\n&gt; Remember that people purposely CREATED these religions.\r\n\r\nYes, but they honestly believed that they were doing good, with the obvious exceptions of John Smith and L. Ron Hubbard. I actually think it's a great reflection on human nature that for the most part, most religions are \"be good to each other\".","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v6h2","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36160-72e21256-01f2-4ecd-9e5b-95d5f4b13a26-1566236772"}

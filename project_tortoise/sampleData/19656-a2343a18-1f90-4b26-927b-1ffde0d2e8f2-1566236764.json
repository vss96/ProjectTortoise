Thought you guys might think that.  If I knew how to use photoshop, I wouldn't waste my time playing this game.  Thanks for thinking my score was so good that it must be shopped.  Its really not that hard.  If you think about it, if I got 25 birds, that right there is 33554432 points.  Its 2^25.  Now factor in doubling also how many bells I got. Its attainable.  Each bell grows in value as you get higher, the bells get smaller in size, and I think the bells were worth something around 3400 points each when I fell.\r\n\r\nEDIT: My math was wrong there, but you get the idea.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19656-a2343a18-1f90-4b26-927b-1ffde0d2e8f2-1566236764"}

Supporters of traditional marriage tend to believe it's a moral and social issue.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vr00","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809203,"author":"nilihm","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvrca","parent_id":"t1_cvr2s","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45640-c953c656-044d-4ba7-896f-4d437486f557-1566236775"}

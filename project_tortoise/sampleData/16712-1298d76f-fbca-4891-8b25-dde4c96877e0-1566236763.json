My problem with it is one of convenience. His system is much more inconvenient to actually use than the reals, even though all the operations (including division) are total. Cancellation laws break down in just the same way, and moreover additive cancellation no longer holds.\r\n\r\nOne can't claim that there's an earth-shattering inconsistency, because there probably isn't, it's just a bit inconvenient. However, the only measuring sticks with which we can judge otherwise consistent axioms are elegance and utility, and I'm willing to claim that the system is much less elegant, and not really any more useful. (Even though it removes some computational exceptions, what used to be tests for zero before division just turn into tests for nullity afterward, because many theorems don't apply to +-Infinity and Nullity, and Nullity is often completely meaningless to the application.)","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u2jy","subreddit":"programming","score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1165605074,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16712-1298d76f-fbca-4891-8b25-dde4c96877e0-1566236763"}

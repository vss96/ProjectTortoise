{"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_t3xg","stickied":false,"body":"All that seemed to really indicate was that PHP lacked good Unicode support, namespaces, and security violations because people turn off magic quotes and don't inspect their SQL before posting it to the database (thus getting SQL injection attacks). I turn off magic quotes and inspect my SQL. For Unicode, I know that's coming. For namespaces, I am strongly trying to encourage the community to consider it because it simply makes sense.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that would be useful in PHP namespaces is the ability to permit automatic lookups if I use a special keyword like \"using\". For instance:\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n$sResult = Strings-&gt;Substr($sSource, $nStart, $nLen);\r\n\r\nI could use:\r\n\r\nUsing Strings;\r\n\r\n$sResult = Substr($sSource, $nStart, $nLen);\r\n\r\nBut I dunno -- perhaps it needs more discussion in the community to come up with the right technique.\r\n\r\nI'm also not a big fan of the \"-&gt;\", but I use it because I have to do so. If I could use \".\" and make all my string concatenation either with another character or use \"&lt;space&gt;.&lt;space&gt;\" I would do so in a heartbeat.\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":-7,"ups":-7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164953342,"subreddit":"programming","id":"ct72v","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct71y","author":"supermike","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807462,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"686-ad1ba3bb-0223-494b-a0af-4748ee34c7ef-1566236758"}

A bigger house might actually need the asme or less artificial lighting for a number of reasons.  A better home design could mean more effective use of sunlight.\r\n\r\nMore space per person doesn't mean using more light either.  I have a bigger house than I did 10 years ago, but that doesn't mean I leave lights on in rooms I happen not to be using at the moment.\r\n\r\nA bigger house certainly means more volume to heat or cool, but a huge part of the bill is how effective the home is in keeping the heat in or out.\r\n\r\nMy current home is bigger and newer than my last house, but it's a lot more efficient at keeping the heat outside or inside.  Considering that my last house shared two walls with neighbors, that's saying something too.\r\n\r\nActually, quality of insulation and windows have been a huge selling point in homes.  Putting in better windows that leak less is a major feature when selling your home.  \r\n\r\nA builder that doesn't take into account the expenses of heating, cooling, and lighting won't be able to sell his homes for as much as a builder that does consider them.\r\n\r\nSo yes, newer bigger homes aren't necessarily more expensive in terms of power.  Yes, obviously an 18 room house 4 times the size of a 5 room house is going to use more power, but a 6 room 3500 square foot home might be more efficient than a 5 room 2000 square foot home.\r\n\r\nIt's not the size, it's what you do with it.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809641,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cweec","id":"cwegu","author":"nosoupforyou","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57635-04bcbe8a-a1d1-4ff8-bd1f-48935bc62d4b-1566236780"}

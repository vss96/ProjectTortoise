{"controversiality":0,"body":"This is a very poor argument. The author claims that at least one of the three premises must be true, and he comes to this conclusion with the logic that (technological maturity) + (interest) -&gt; successful implementation. Anyone familiar with both the history and theory of computer science should know that 1) computational resources are not unlimited, and 2) the applications built with those resources are limited by the intellect of those doing the building. In the 1960's, computer scientists and others were fearlessly predicting the creation of artificial intelligence systems whose intellect would match or exceed that of human beings. Forty years later, it's quite obvious that that is easier said than done. The claim that technological maturity will lead to \"vastly many more simulated minds than non-simulated minds\" depends upon an assumption that there will be a nearly unfathomable increase in both computing power and intellect. The fallback, of course, is to say that, if we are part of a simualation, then maybe we have no real understanding of the limits of computational power and intellect, but this presupposes the conclusion, and is no argument at all.","link_id":"t3_tn72","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165290143,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"monkeySpibb","id":"ctnc0","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tn72","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807768,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8215-286bed10-e47d-43d7-a461-b1e389c11248-1566236760"}

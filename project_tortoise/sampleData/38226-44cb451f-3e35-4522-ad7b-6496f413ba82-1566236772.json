Neither does it \"preserve the state\"; that is a delusion, a fantasy. Countless states, kingdoms, empires and regimes practised torture and perished anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat keeps a state stable is its ability to keep the peace within, and to defend itself without.\r\n\r\n(Having said that, one must consider the basics of human psychology: as long as the USA remains strong, united and stable, it will be resented for this no matter what it does or doesn't do. It's called envy.)\r\n\r\nTorture represents only a failure on the moral, pragmatic, strategic and psychological level. \r\n\r\nIt's not just that using torture will \"lower America to the level of its enemies\"; it could actually turn America INTO the same kind of country as its enemies: poor, backward, unstable, mired with civil strife, lawless, ignored and shunned by the rest of the world.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38226-44cb451f-3e35-4522-ad7b-6496f413ba82-1566236772"}

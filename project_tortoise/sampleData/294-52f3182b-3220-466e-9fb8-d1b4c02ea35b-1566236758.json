Perl, when taught properly and in an organized fashion, can be a beautiful, easy to read, easy to understand language. Sure, I use PHP every day, and sure I wish it supported namespaces, Unicode strings, the ability to use \".\" instead of \"-&gt;\", and a small handful of other things, but I use it because it's mainstream for web apps on Linux, has a rich API, and a mostly non-academic, pleasant developer community for it, and is so easy to use that it lets me focus on business processes rather than language academics. Perl, however, is more academic that appeals to professors, has a crankier RTFM-type developer crowd to ask advice from, has a rich API, and is not promoted as a premier web language in the mainstream today (although that is changing).\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":-6,"ups":-6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164938920,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct6bv","id":"ct6cs","author_flair_text":null,"author":"supermike","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807449,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"294-52f3182b-3220-466e-9fb8-d1b4c02ea35b-1566236758"}

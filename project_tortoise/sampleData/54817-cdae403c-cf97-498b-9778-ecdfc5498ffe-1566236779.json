As the article mentions, the customer doesn't know or care that 90% of the product is non-UI.  They only see the UI, and if it looks shitty &amp; unpolished, they're going to assume that the rest of the product is shitty and unpolished.  Then they'll go elsewhere and put their money behind the fancy competitor  with a polished demo.  If you're lucky they'll come back to you when they realize the rest of the competitor's product sucks; if you're not, you'll run out of money before then.\r\n\r\nIf the customer's already on board, *then* you want to make the UI reflect the product's internal state.  This'll help manage expectations and give you more time to create a happy customer.  But if the customer is likely to walk, don't show them something ugly.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8b1","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809537,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nostrademons","id":"cw8xb","parent_id":"t3_w8b1","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54817-cdae403c-cf97-498b-9778-ecdfc5498ffe-1566236779"}

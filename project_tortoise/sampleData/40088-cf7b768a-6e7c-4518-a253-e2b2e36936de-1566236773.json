{"body":"Nice one Browzer. You successfully threw in the red herring and the discussion has degenerated into a discussion about legalizing dope. How about facing the real problem? The USA is BROKE. Hello? Hello? \r\n\r\nMaybe it's time to rethink your political system and overhaul your tax and accounting system. After all, that was what your revolution against the Brits was all about wasn't it?

Thank you very much for being so blind.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vc4j","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166584484,"author":"ThaiTai","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvcjg","id":"cvg4i","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808986,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40088-cf7b768a-6e7c-4518-a253-e2b2e36936de-1566236773"}

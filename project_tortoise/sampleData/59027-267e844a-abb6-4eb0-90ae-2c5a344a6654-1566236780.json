And as these do not cause any prejudice, I don't think they're impacted. That's not the spirit of the law anyway. And it would be hard to find a judge in France to rule against this very very old right.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59027-267e844a-abb6-4eb0-90ae-2c5a344a6654-1566236780"}

I can't imagine any remotely realistic situation in which there could be 'no doubt'.\r\n\r\n&gt;if one is positively sure that he has information and one asks the correct questions with the proper amount of durress he will absolutley tell the truth about the situation.\r\n\r\nunless the guy whose body the torturer is systematically maiming is misinformed, or in too much pain and confusion to be coherent. Try giving me an accurate account of anything complicated when I'm crushing your finger-joints with a pair of pliers. Or when he thinks the interrogator will be angry with a piece of information, or won't believe it.\r\n\r\nAll this is beside the point because the possibility of being 'positively sure' is so unrealistic as to make it useless as anything other than a thought experiment.","ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166634018,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvic5","parent_id":"t1_cvi50","author":"lessofthat","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809029,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41145-509072bb-8575-48b8-84e7-a9c79de2157b-1566236773"}

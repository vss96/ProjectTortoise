With a moment's thought I can think of dozens of obvious non-idiots - from colleagues to family to public figures - who believe in the man in the sky (and I mean a naive, literal God not one of these theological titty-twister specials). So can you, I'm sure.\r\n\r\nYou might believe in the man in the sky because (eg) you're reliant on a metaphysical comfort blanket, or badly educated, or the victim of childhood indoctrination. None of these exclude you being an idiot, but none of them require it either.\r\n\r\n&gt; no difference between worshiping zeus and worshiping god.\r\n\r\nZeus wants more burnt goats and has better hair.\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166458627,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36008-f322462c-7341-4ef1-aed4-1e7084fd7fc3-1566236772"}

This was usually quickly followed up by calling me \"jew!\"(!!!???) Or they might just skip the first bit and go\r\n for the \"jew\" insult first.\r\n\r\nThis was VERY common in ALL parts of Morocco. The only other\r\n insult that was in anyway near as common was the french word for faggot.\r\n\r\nIf there hasn't been much recent evidence of anti-jewish sentiment there I think it is most likely because most of \r\nthem have left for Israel.\r\n\r\n    By the way a Canadian jewish friend of mine had the exact same experience as me with the addition of being \r\ncalled \"Nazi Jew!\". This confused the hell out of him as he \r\ndidn't know that the name of the game was, as far as I can tell after a lot of experience with it, \"if you can't get \r\nany money from the target, you still win the game if you can upset him\" or something along those lines.\r\n\r\nIn the context of this article it makes what he did all the more brave and admirable to me.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807652,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctgr8","id":"cth3n","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Redwan","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5322-c0cef350-a445-44b0-b0e1-f05618ced2fa-1566236759"}

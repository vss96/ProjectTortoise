If the child is so out of hand (which obviously started at home) that he has other outstanding charges, such as assaulting a police officer AND being kicked out of school for disorderly conduct... honestly, what other option was left? It is against the law to use corporal punishment: if she'd tried, SHE would have been arrested. \r\n\r\nParents are not given any recourse in cases such as this. Yes, she obviously has discipline issues or he may never have gotten this bad. But, he also may never gotten this bad if the law didn't protect the children against all but the most timid form of punishment at home. We've gotten to the point where we're too afraid to even smack a child's hand if they reach for something dangerous! And worse, kids KNOW they can just call up the police and claim assault any time mum or dad piss them off... such as the article that was up on Reddit not too long ago about the father being arrested because the son got upset about being sent to his room.","link_id":"t3_tqqa","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10224-b5434862-8132-42c3-9e88-4aff742e73ba-1566236761"}

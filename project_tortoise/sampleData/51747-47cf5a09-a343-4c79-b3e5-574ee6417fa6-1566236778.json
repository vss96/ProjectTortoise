{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w14h","stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"body":"I have noticed that the tendency of people to write and/or accept checks varies even between different states within the US.  Several years ago I moved from North Carolina (NC) to Minnesota (MN).  In NC many businesses were unwilling to accept checks, or would accept them only after seeing two forms of ID and maybe even calling the bank for verification.  When I moved to MN I was surprised to see people doing things like writing a check for $5.95 in a fast food restaurant.  The first time I saw a friend try to do that I said, \"What are you doing? They won't take a check here!\"  But I was wrong.  They took the check without question.  I soon learned that NC and MN had a definite cultural difference on this point.  However, in the last few years I have started to see more Minnesota businesses post signs saying \"Sorry, we no longer accept checks.\" That's fine with me -- I have never enjoyed writing checks myself.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167169769,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cw3aj","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw2bn","author":"edbutler3","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809429,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51747-47cf5a09-a343-4c79-b3e5-574ee6417fa6-1566236778"}

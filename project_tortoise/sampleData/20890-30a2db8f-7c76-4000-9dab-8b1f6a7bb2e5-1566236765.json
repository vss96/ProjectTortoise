{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ubo5","stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"body":"It has always seemed strange to me that there is a vaguely tacit acceptance of the violence and abuses that take place in America's prison system. \r\n\r\nWhether one thinks that those abuses are a part of the punishment that goes along with prison, it strikes me that there is an unacceptable degree of arbitrariness associated with it. \r\n\r\nFor those who are of the mind that people who commit crimes deserve both to go to prison and be abused in manner consistent with what we often hear about, than there needs to be a system for it.  Because the extent to which one is vulnerable to abuse varies from prisoner to prisoner there is no way to know that any prisoner’s “punishment” is commensurate with his or her crime.\r\n\r\nWhen one looks at it from a logical perspective, it becomes clear that if one is to accept prison violence and abuse among prisoners, then he or she must also be in favor of establishing state task forces devoted to abusing prisoners in a systemic manner – something that very few of us could possible favor.\r\n\r\nWhile many prisoners have committed repellent acts, when we look at the situation logically, tolerance for the type of violence and abuse that we often hear about in prisons requires one to stomach some pretty unacceptable things.","score":11,"ups":11,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165788957,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cud3s","parent_id":"t3_ubo5","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808249,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20890-30a2db8f-7c76-4000-9dab-8b1f6a7bb2e5-1566236765"}

{"body":"Interesting points.\r\n\r\nI think it important to note that an omnipotent Christian God has granted (presumably out of his omnipotence) man-kind free-will because God's existence depends on it.\r\n\r\nWith out free-will there is no sin.\r\n\r\nWithout sin Christianity has no power.\r\n\r\nChristianity constructed free-will as a system of punishment.  It has no validity outside of that.\r\n\r\nIn order to feel free-will one must falsely place themselves at the center, otherwise the illusion fails.\r\n\r\nTo us you are way too predictable.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vf8l","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166595454,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"lacus","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvgm5","parent_id":"t1_cvgld","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808996,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40367-5b11c174-0423-431c-b034-fbb8fc7f1d9e-1566236773"}

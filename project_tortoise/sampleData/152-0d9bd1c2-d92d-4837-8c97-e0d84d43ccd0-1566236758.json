There are now billions of dollars being made by forced labor in America, with \"prison wages\" resembling sweat shops.  Some prisoners are \"employed\" to support the war in Iraq, for example, making military supplies.  Everything from clothing to license plates is now being manufactured by conscripted labor in this country.  Favored contracts are being provided to various states for these \"industrial prisons\" too, which is why you will **not** see prison populations go down, but go **up**.  It's a simple matter of economics, more slaves means more profits. It has nothing to do with \"crime\" at all.\r\n\r\nAlso, victimless \"crimes\" are at the forefront of high prison populations (such as the war on drugs).","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t3ju","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"152-0d9bd1c2-d92d-4837-8c97-e0d84d43ccd0-1566236758"}

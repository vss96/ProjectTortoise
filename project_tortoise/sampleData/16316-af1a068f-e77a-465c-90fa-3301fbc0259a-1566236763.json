The formal systems don't care whether you treat divide by zero as undefined or not, but if you want to keep them consistent, defining it has all sorts of implications. Cale was pointing out (as did a commenter above) that to switch from undefined to defined has implications for the formal systems studied today, all the way down to that which is commonly taught at lower-level university concepts like group theory and ZF set theory.\r\n\r\nIf anything I think Cale shows that it is not quite transparent why the nullity issue is such a troublesome one - any idiot with dung on his boots can sit there and say \"you can't divide by zero!\". When asked why, however, they usually can't explain the ramifications of assuming it to be true, much beyond \"well that's what we learned in school\".","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165596547,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"cu4vq","parent_id":"t1_cu3sx","author_flair_text":null,"author":"rafuzo2","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808094,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16316-af1a068f-e77a-465c-90fa-3301fbc0259a-1566236763"}

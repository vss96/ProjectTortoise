I set off a Molotov cocktail in my back yard once and nearly scared the crap out of myself when it produced a 15-foot tall mushroom-shaped fireball, and then proceeded to make a big burn patch in our lawn.\r\n\r\nWhen I was younger than that, I would make explosives by painstakingly cutting the explosive bits out of paper rolls of caps, then stuffing them into paper or cardboard tubes.  The first largish bomb (a few centimetres long) that I made in this fashion was lit by my mother, because I was not old enough to be allowed matches.\r\n\r\nFrustrated by the makeshift paper wick, which kept going out, and believing that my \"bomb\" was just harmless paper anyway, she pulled the wick out and thrust a lit match directly into the explosive mixture I had created.  It blew up in her face; she screamed and staggered backwards saying \"I'm blind!  I'm blind!\"\r\n\r\nShe was fine, but from then on my father lit the bombs, until I was old enough to buy a lighter at the nearby convenience store.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808121,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu69i","parent_id":"t3_u5p4","author_flair_text":null,"author":"adrian","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17126-dbee1fae-0985-4aa3-aab6-9b192673a11b-1566236763"}

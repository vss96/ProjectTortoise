(In other \r\n&gt; words, banning pattern precedence/overlapping will have no\r\n&gt; effect on the example.)\r\n\r\nSee nostrademons answer.\r\n\r\nI consider pattern matching (i.e. case-expressions) in a non-pure language for a control construct. Since we are seeking a definition of if in terms of function application that also works in a non-pure language, we need something else than pattern matching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808667,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuy9q","edited":false,"id":"cuzbm","author_flair_text":null,"author":"soegaard","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31743-f33fe321-9939-45b4-a599-7899e231aa1d-1566236770"}

He could not even make any run.\r\nIs he, by any chance awarded as a best player?\r\n\r\nBelow, I will try to express my feeling about not only the game, but also players as well.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw his face the first time I was sure then I am watching the best player of all times. But later on I was so shocked and most of them ashamed.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion he wants something, but what? More money???\r\n\r\nI think, then he should be FLINT - OFF before he does more damage to the co-player and in English cricket in global.\r\n\r\nFirst is first: who did he think he was representing?:\r\n- England or\r\n- first of all CROWN?\r\n\r\nBecause his perfomence was not good enough even for basic league player. And, also kwonledge of team's coache and team's management. Did they ask him (or team as whole) what is going on? Are they by any chance on holidays downunder?\r\n\r\nFor me his performence was agly shamefull, inapropriate and discusting.\r\n\r\nIn this place I like to make some remarks: who is allowe to represents a England in any sports: foregners (like him) or englishmen with a English hariitage?\r\n\r\nAnd I also notice then a coach is not teaching them anything knew usefull not only to play games but also to raise their skill's level.\r\n\r\nHow it happened then they allow not only Ponting but also the other many australian players to make so much runs?\r\n\r\nThe other matter is: did the English team's management make any complaints about a Shane Warne's and Bratt Lee  behaviours on the playground? Do you think it should not be send some official notices not only to australian's cricket board but also to international bodies. And it finishes the first day.\r\n\r\nHow about second game in Adelaide?\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nHow, for f--- sake they allow again to make so much runs by the Ponting and this time Hussey and Clarke?\r\n\r\nThat is disgusting! \"Big\" captain is may be the best player but Hussey and Clark showes then they are much better every time they play then the 'best' English captain.\r\n\r\nEvery time when English team is on the playgroung I can clear see then they do not know what to do with a batt!\r\nThe only movement they can make is to guard their balls between the legs. Coach is not teaching them how to play diffrentely, because he do not know how? What their have got those wooden batts for? Do they know? Why a coach is not teaching them how to place a batt under the comeing ball? And, what I have also noticed they can not move forward even one step ahead to incoming ball. It's again looks like then they ball between legs are very havy.\r\n\r\nEven for such a cricket ingorant as I am myself it is obvious then when the spinners spins the ball - balls movement will only when the ball touches ground. Why for f---sake coach is not able to teach them hown to shot the ball before is landing on the ground?\r\n\r\nRecommendations:\r\n================\r\n\r\nI like you to ask on your newspaper the public what their think about English cricketer,s performence in Australia?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion I think then Englishmen must always remember then perfoming anywhere person is representing not only Enland but first in all CROWN.\r\n\r\nAnd I think English cricket board should FLINT him OFF for good. His rebeliers behaviour in Australia is doing more damage then any goods for phicological purposes.\r\n\r\nAnd in my opinion I am quite sure then not only captain but first in all - team's management came here for holidays and to have fun - not to play some serious game.\r\n\r\nYour ancestors has colonised this vulcano islnad but how to play cricket - you must learn from decendence of the slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nRyszard KOZAK\r\nAustralia.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tj9f","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807694,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rysiekkoz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tj9f","id":"ctjee","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6325-6a23937d-0dc8-4b94-b7f7-9181e95cb8bb-1566236760"}

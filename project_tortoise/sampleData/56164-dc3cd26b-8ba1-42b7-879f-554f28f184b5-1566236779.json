You seem to think you should be the arbiter of other people's decisions. Perhaps they know something you don't.\r\n\r\n&gt; it's shameful that our rail system is completely dead when it's a cheap and efficient alternative to air travel. \r\n\r\nWTF? Rail can't operate without **billions** in subsidies. Who told you it was cheap? Rail is *anything* but cheap.\r\n\r\nGet rid of the subsidies and lets see if rail can compete on it's merits. Hint, it can't, because people don't want rail. They want something better. Really it's that simple, if people wanted to use rail it wouldn't need to be subsidised. When they see the full market cost of their ticket they say \"no, it isn't worth that\".\r\n\r\nI've been on rail all across europe and not one of them operates without enormous subsidies, to the tune of around 50% on average it seems.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8qa","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809588,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"css1971","edited":false,"id":"cwblo","parent_id":"t1_cwbj8","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56164-dc3cd26b-8ba1-42b7-879f-554f28f184b5-1566236779"}

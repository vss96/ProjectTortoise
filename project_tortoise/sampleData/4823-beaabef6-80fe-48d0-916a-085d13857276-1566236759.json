I am possibly the Pakistani posting here. While the party screaming bloody murder is a right-wing, fundamental religious party, the President is a Muslim too, as are a majority of the politicians who voted for this bill to pass. \r\n\r\nCalling this a \"Muslim\" demand is akin to stating that all Americans support the Iraq war. In fact, we didn't even vote  these monkey's into power, so they can't claim to represent Pakistanis/Pakistani Muslims/Muslims (something which Bush can for Americans).\r\n\r\nThis headline is racist, generalist, sensationalist and demeaning to Pakistanis. Grow up.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I am glad many people recognize it as such.","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1165147666,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4823-beaabef6-80fe-48d0-916a-085d13857276-1566236759"}

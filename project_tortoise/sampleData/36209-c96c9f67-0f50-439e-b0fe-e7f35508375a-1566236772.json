In one sense religion is responsible for both much good and much evil, because a lot of good and a lot of evil have both been done by \"believers\" in the names of their respective causes. But religion isn't the original source of good or evil.\r\n\r\n&gt;Yes, but they honestly believed that they were doing good, with the obvious exceptions of John Smith and L. Ron Hubbard.\r\n\r\nIf whoever wrote the Jewish Bible thought they were doing good, their morals must already have been somewhat shot. When you build a God from scratch and that God is as moody and inhumane as the God of the Old Testament, it probably means you yourself aren't thinking straight. That's my point - that most religions *do propagate suffering*, but they aren't the *original cause* of it.\r\n\r\nIf you eliminated religion you'd still have good people and evil people.","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36209-c96c9f67-0f50-439e-b0fe-e7f35508375a-1566236772"}

Most of the rest of Japan are much better with kanji and native Japanese words. For some reason people in Tokyo think it is very cosmopolitan to use English loan words instead of native Japanese words.\r\n\r\nTry asking your co-worker what the Japanese word for door is (as in when they say \"doa\" on the subway, and write it in Katakana). It might suprise them if you tell them that they say \"tobira\" in Western Japan (and write it in Kanji). People in Tokyo grow up thinking of \"tobira\" as a traditional Japanese sliding door, and \"doa\" as a modern automated train door.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809460,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw4xc","parent_id":"t1_cw0ph","author":"popoip","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52710-ec21693d-1756-4dbe-bbab-0e6f0f90f182-1566236778"}

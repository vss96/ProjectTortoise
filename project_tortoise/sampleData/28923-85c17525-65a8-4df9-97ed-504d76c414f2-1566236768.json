Did I not do the full Columbo routine on this before I posted? FFS! I will write out 100 times: \"When I find something interesting I will not just post it to Reddit. Instead I will drop everything and spend my day tracing its original source - however many links removed it may be from the story that actually grabbed my attention - then finding and confirming it with two independent eye-witnesses, and running it past a specially convened 12-man editorial board who can check it for plausibility and factual correctness. Then, just for good measure, I will read everything else posted on any sites involved in case they may have left cryptic clues as to the veracity of the stories lying around. And finally, I'll call bullshit on it anyway.\" \r\n\r\nAs it happens I think it is wrong to slavishly credit the original story; far better to give the kudos to the treatment of the story which a) pushed my buttons and b) was disseminated in such away that it came to a Redditor's attention.\r\n\r\nAnd internetretailing.net a dubious site? Looks like a perfectly legitimate business to me, bud. If you want dubious, the other comments here indicate that the original source is a much better fit...","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808555,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cute9","parent_id":"t1_cusrj","author":"mpclark","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28923-85c17525-65a8-4df9-97ed-504d76c414f2-1566236768"}

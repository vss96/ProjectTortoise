I see no reason why a Belgium and a Flanders wouldn't do nicely as well, presuming both would be in the EU of course. It would also be yet another example to countries with unhappily cojoined ethnic factions that they don't have to kill each other as a solution to their grievances.\r\n\r\nWe would also have a new acronym for the geographically small countries in the area too: Beneflux. Has a nice ring to it in my opinion.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_urbg","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166112048,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":13,"ups":13,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28140-cf59987c-5471-466b-94e0-91ca85ad14e0-1566236768"}

I've been trying to spread this meme on reddit whenever I can, but not very successfully :(\r\n\r\nOne thing it didn't really mention though is risk.  Whilst you may not be able to beat the market on average, you can at least try to insulate yourself from crashes by spreading out your investments.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to ensure you are not overly exposed in any particular asset class or market sector.  For example, if you're job is in the tech sector and you hold lots of tech stocks, then a crash in the tech market will leave you both unemployed and without savings.  On the other hand, if you had shares in everything other than tech, you can rely on having something (either a job or some money) in all eventualities.\r\n\r\nLikewise, everyone needs somewhere to live.  If you buy a house and the market crashes, at least you have somewhere to live.  OTOH if you don't buy a house and the price explodes, you end up not being able to afford anywhere.\r\n\r\nA lot of the stuff people buy is from asia.  If the interest rates change drastically, then a dollar will buy you far fewer clothes than it did before.  Perhaps holding chinese stock will insulate you from this risk.\r\n\r\nMost things you buy require raw materials.  If the citizens of the developing world suddenly become consumers, the extra demand will make all manufactured products shoot up in cost.  If you want to be able to afford things in this eventuality, invest in these to.  Ditto food.\r\n\r\nI think everyone should compile a list of risks they are exposed to, and go and invest in some kind of index-tracked fund for each of them.  As the article says, chasing returns is a mugs game.\r\n\r\nEdit - Sorry, I meant exchange rate, not interest rate.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_unas","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26966-73d56059-efac-4fbc-a200-482243bf8a2a-1566236768"}

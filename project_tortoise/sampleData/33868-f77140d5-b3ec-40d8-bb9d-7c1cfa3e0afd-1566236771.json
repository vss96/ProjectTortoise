{"controversiality":0,"body":"Look how many times politicians and meida talking-heads refer to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a Holocaust denier. Though he certainly doesn't like jewish people or Isreal, he does not deny the holocaust. In one of his infamous speeches he asks who caused the holocaust and answers Europeans, not Muslims. The linked artilce makes the mistake of calling the entire conference about Holocaust denial. No. Not true. It is an open exploration of the subject which happens to include a shit-load of racist people. Distasteful or not, lets get the facts straight. Its telling that \"the haolocaust\" only refers to the 6 million jews killed. Why does it NOT include the OTHER 6 million gypsies, gays, communists and others killed? In total, 12 million people were killed by a government. Everyone keeps saying 6 million jews, very rarely referencing the other 6 million people that also got killed.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v1y6","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166367786,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":12,"ups":12,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lenny247","id":"cv40v","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv3xs","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808757,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33868-f77140d5-b3ec-40d8-bb9d-7c1cfa3e0afd-1566236771"}

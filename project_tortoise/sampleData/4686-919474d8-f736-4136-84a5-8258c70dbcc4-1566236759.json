However, the author absolutely loaded the vocabulary against Wikipedia.  This bias is so evident that giving an example almost seems silly, but this quote from a member of the band on the first page will do:\r\n\r\n&gt;\"I urge whatever Internet-snob wiki-geeks who deem our band 'non-notable' to look at their own lives.\"\r\n\r\nChildren and immature adults often call into question the \"lives\" of their opponents after losing a debate.\r\n\r\nThat Wikipedia should not delete non-notable items from its pages is an assumption, not a conclusion, of this article.  That assumption is wrong.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807621,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tfak","id":"ctfhy","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4686-919474d8-f736-4136-84a5-8258c70dbcc4-1566236759"}

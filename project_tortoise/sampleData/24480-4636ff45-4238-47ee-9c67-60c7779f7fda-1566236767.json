{"body":"Yes, I know it's possible to run a lot of software on cd players, etc., but you can't compare it to a computer.\r\nFor one thing, you don't have a GPU in your cd player, while you do have one in your computer. This is very complex hardware. Your screen is another example of something complicated.\r\nAnd the hardware that your cd player does have, isn't extremely sophisticated - why would it be? The software is basic enough. For this reason, your cd player's maker doesn't have to deal with stuff like for example VLSI, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd either way, your player still costs a lot more than two cd's. So the article's reasoning is still moot.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ujgi","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1165919490,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":-2,"score":-2,"author":"LudoA","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cujun","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cujq2","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808379,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24480-4636ff45-4238-47ee-9c67-60c7779f7fda-1566236767"}

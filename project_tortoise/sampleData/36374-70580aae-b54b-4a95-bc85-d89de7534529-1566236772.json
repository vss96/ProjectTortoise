I'm one of those people that have always had very secure Windows boxes and pretty much never run into problems.  The biggest issue with new computers are OEM software installations.  The default set up on a machine coming from most major retailers is so clogged up with \"quick start\" modules (20 icons in the tray?!?), MIME mismatches and crappy software additions that have their own security holes that the only reasonable thing to do with a new computer is format it, reinstall a clean XP with SP2 slipstreamed, immediately get your patches and then install everything else you need.  And that's exactly what I was planning on doing.\r\n\r\nBut when I thought about spending 2 hours going through this process vs. popping in a LiveCD, clicking the installer icon and being done, I went with the LiveCD approach.  It's just a matter of my time.\r\n\r\nThat said... installing the network driver was a pain, but only because Toshiba provided the wrong driver on their site.  NDISWrapper works really well when you get the right driver in there.\r\n\r\nThe surprise in all of this is that Ubuntu is really working better for my mom than XP was.  It's the little things like Beagle / Deskbar, image previews for everything in Nautilus and the simplified menu structure that have been real positives.  It will be interesting to see how it all comes together for my mom.  I love the discussion about this too.

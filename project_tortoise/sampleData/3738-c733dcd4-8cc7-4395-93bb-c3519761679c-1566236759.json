Heck, if they are, they aren't exaggerated enough. First, the stats are for *thirty* years. They are also for a country of *250* to *300* million people (over that 30 years). Note that the article doesn't mention the number of abortion clinics in the united states; and a quick google didn't give me that number - but wikipedia did provide the statistic that there were at least 1.4 million abortions per year from 1977 through the 1990's.\r\n\r\nSo, for quick hand waving purposes: 30 years of abortions at 1.4 million per year, 42 million abortions.\r\n\r\n42 **million** abortions versus a grand total of about 36 **hundred** acts of violence, including seven murders.\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like you're more likely to get mugged on your way to having an abortion than you are to suffer violence at the abortion clinic.\r\n\r\n*Update: that 3,600 comes from adding up all the stats listed in the article.*","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807580,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctdf3","parent_id":"t1_ctcrp","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3738-c733dcd4-8cc7-4395-93bb-c3519761679c-1566236759"}

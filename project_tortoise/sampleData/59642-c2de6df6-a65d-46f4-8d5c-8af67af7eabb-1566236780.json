This administration is practically hostile toward the media, and it's harder than ever for journalists to determine the value of the information they are given. The lack of proof for any assertion makes it difficult to question publicly whether or not the government is lying. Fortunately, the journalists in the story demonstrate that it's not impossible -- but it doesn't surprise me that they are exceptional in their field. Journalism is filled with mediocrity, and that makes the media easy for a well-organised government to manipulate.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wh2n","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167538262,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59642-c2de6df6-a65d-46f4-8d5c-8af67af7eabb-1566236780"}

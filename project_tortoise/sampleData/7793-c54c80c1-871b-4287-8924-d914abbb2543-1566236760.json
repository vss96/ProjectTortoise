I'm positive that some chose not to act and others didn't act out of fear or common sense.\r\n\r\nSecondly I have a hard time agreeing that the death penalty is the proper punishment or that it would prevent similar crimes from happening.  If anything, it has been quite well proven that the Death Penalty does not discourage similar crimes from happening.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am surprised that people are letting their emotions get the better of them in this situation.  Women are molested, attacked and raped all over the world - this is just an isolated incident that folks seem to have their panties in a bunch over.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807751,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cst4w","edited":false,"id":"ctmfp","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Eugi","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7793-c54c80c1-871b-4287-8924-d914abbb2543-1566236760"}

Rather, I’d say it mostly due to the language being rather terse and the limited use of squiggly characters. Personally, I find Ruby even more readable than Python, which I believe is due to the convention of method chaining in Ruby (along with sharing the above mentioned characteristics with Python). Of course, this assumes proper indentation of the Ruby code.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uhgd","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808425,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"tjogin","parent_id":"t3_uhgd","edited":false,"id":"cumdg","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25645-c9a29552-17c8-4998-aa94-a0b1c9296e2b-1566236767"}

{"body":"&gt;pressure by dropping from the sky, combined, can create.\r\n\r\nI don't think the rest of your post was that far off, but what were you trying to say here? Atmospheric pressure is (in the frame of reference of explosive devices) negligible at any altitude or subsonic speed. The pressure of a device striking the ground is a moot point, as nuclear weapons are usually not designed to ever even touch the ground. Both bombs dropped on Japan were airburst devices, both detonated at around 2000 ft above the ground.\r\n\r\nAny sort of \"pressure by dropping from the sky\" is not a factor in nuclear bombs. Yes, it requires an amazing amount of force, but all of that force is supplied by the conventional explosives.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v1wz","subreddit":"science","score":9,"ups":9,"created_utc":1166313749,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"cecilkorik","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cv2av","id":"cv2d0","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808725,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33029-3b244723-8d1e-4f7c-8297-d728fb943efc-1566236770"}

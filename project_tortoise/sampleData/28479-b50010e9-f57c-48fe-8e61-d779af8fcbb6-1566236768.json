Is much harder than becoming a fighter pilot, for example?  Might the average fighter pilot be even better trained than the average astronaut?\r\n\r\nOn the mental front, how much physics does an astronaut need to know?  Is the typcial astronaut even good at physics at all?\r\n\r\nThe author seems to think only a very few people in the entire world are good enough to be astronauts, or that the qualities that make an effective astronaut are rather spread out at the high end.  In other words, the 10 most astronauty people in the world would be noticably better than a random selection from the top 1000 most astronauty people in the world.\r\n\r\nIn any event, I have my doubts about what we are getting for our money with manned missions.  I think the money would be better spent on developing better propulsion.\r\n\r\nI might be persuaded that manned missions are so inspiring that without them, there would be significantly less interest overall in space, and that would hold back the progress on real work (propulsion technology, robotics, ...) that is going to open up space to us.  I don't generally see people doing a good job of making that argument.\r\n","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28479-b50010e9-f57c-48fe-8e61-d779af8fcbb6-1566236768"}

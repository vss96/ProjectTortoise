Anyway, as a programmer and sculptor your article resonates somewhat. There's a moment when sculpting (or programming) when you're faced with a choice; do this next bit the quick and dirty way,  or the hard way. If you're really analyzing your behaviour at that moment, you know the best way to proceed. Any human task can be characterized by this constant set of options between easy and hard, and the best things that humans produce are weighted towards the hard.\r\n\r\nThat said, your article may not feel intuitively correct in some ways. Most of us will judge the article based upon our own experiences, and our own experiences will normally be of a small-ish audience reviewing our work. In this context, opinions will often be diverging and sample sizes not large enough for human commonality to come into play in a significant fashion. Case in point: my girlfriend does amazing figurative oil paintings, merging modern poses, etc with quite traditional painterly methods. Years back she was rejected when she applied to art school; her paintings lacking a certain \"conceptual awareness.\" Her paintings represent an objective \"good\" (in that they are skillful and intentional), but due to the small set of admissions people that evaluated her work, she was rejected. I think many readers will have similar experiences with which to relate to your article, which may impede its message somewhat.\r\n\r\n-Andy","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ufsk","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808318,"author":"amauro","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cugpj","parent_id":"t3_ufsk","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22795-bcc0dbed-9fd0-4899-9b5f-3cadcff1832d-1566236766"}

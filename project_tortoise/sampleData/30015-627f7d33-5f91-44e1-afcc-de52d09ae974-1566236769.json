And I don't mean surface characteristics - I mean, fundamentally changing how things work. The same could be done in a language like Lisp.\r\n\r\nBut that's nothing. A client program written in Lisp can be controlled to an infinite degree by the server. You could generate an infinite variety of animated effects, and instead of having to prepare the client for every variation, simply send the client the rendering code and have it on-the-fly compiled. Send it simultaneously to everyone in the viewing area, and they'll all see the same procedurally generated animation. What fun this would be to play with!\r\n\r\nWe are at the stage in computing evolution when our \"haxxor fantasies\" can become real.

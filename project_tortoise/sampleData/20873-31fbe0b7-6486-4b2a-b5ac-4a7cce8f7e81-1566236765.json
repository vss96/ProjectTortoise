When Clinton was impeached, there is a great photo of him holding a Bible outside his church. Fact is --- there is *NO* conflict between religion and politics, and there is *NO* conflict between religion and science. \r\n\r\nSomeone to say \"Hey I am not a Christian because I disagree with the republican party\" is being naive, not noting that virtually *EVERY* US President ever has been Christian -- and that includes many Democrats. Not to mention the current make up of Congress.\r\n\r\nMy objection is the way the eight year old is being USED without her consent (or even a possible way to understand what it means to be paraded before millions of people -- to be *FOREVER* recognized as \"that little girl spewing hate\") -- and this outrages me *REGARDLESS* of content -- religious, political, or anything else! Its *WRONG*. \r\n\r\nThis should outrage every atheist on here as much as every non-atheist. My earlier point is, if the opinions being advanced were *CHRISTIAN* --- then I can bet a million dollars every atheist on here would be saying how wrong the parents were etc etc. \r\n\r\nThis is a *DOUBLE STANDARD* and its *WRONG TO THE KID*.","controversiality":1,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"created_utc":1165788531,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20873-31fbe0b7-6486-4b2a-b5ac-4a7cce8f7e81-1566236765"}

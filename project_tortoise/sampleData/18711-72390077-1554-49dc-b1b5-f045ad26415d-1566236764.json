It then proceeded to offer several recommendations.  One of those, however, was not to pull the troops out.  The report stated that since we started this mess, we have a responsibility to do the utmost to restore the situation.  This should be accomplished with a renewed diplomatic effort, and an internal effort as well.  If the Iraqis do not uphold their end of the bargain, we should lessen our political and military support.  That is the gist of the report.  I would not classify that as advising Bush to pull out the troops, unless I am grossly misinterpreting the report.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_u6ti","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18711-72390077-1554-49dc-b1b5-f045ad26415d-1566236764"}

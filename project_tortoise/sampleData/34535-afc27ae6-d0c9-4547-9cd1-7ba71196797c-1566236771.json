{"controversiality":0,"body":"As a European living in the US I have to say that in North America the attitude to circumcision is not so much strange as UNEXAMINED. I had a conversation with a highly educated friend (PhD) about whether he would have any male children circumcised. This is a guy who is extremely eco-conscious, left-leaning, libertarian and who has examined many aspects of modern life and found them wanting.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I would!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI have to admit I was shocked. We talked about it a bit more and went through all the normal arguments :\r\n\r\n\"It's cleaner\" - It takes 2 second to peel back a foreskin and wash it.\r\n\r\n\"They can get infected\" - So can a finger, cutting it off is not a reasonable precaution.\r\n\r\n\"It's easier to catch HIV\" - Wearing a condom is more effective.\r\n\r\nIn the end he was down to \"It's just better!\" If I'd pushed harder I suspect we would have eventually reached \"I'm circumcised and that is my image of a healthy penis, I wouldn't want him to look strange.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a guy I like and respect. I didn't want to hear that he would be willing to unnecessarily operate on his healthy boy-children to maintain his own self-image and world view so I didn't push him to do so.\r\n\r\nMy point is that this was something he had never even considered. I went home frightened that there might be things in my life, things I was 100% sure of, which would not stand up to the light of reason.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at a practice like circumcision, something that can be shown to be totally unnecessary you have to ask Who Profits? One of the beneficiaries are US surgeons who might charge $150-200 to the health insurers for every 5-minute circumcision they perform, a practice worth a few million a year I'm sure. Otherwise why would the \"circumcise\" option even appear on the hospital forms?\r\n\r\nI hesitate to call circumcision \"mutilation\" because you can live a healthy productive life without a foreskin, I just say it's unnecessary and the facts bear this out.\r\n\r\nStill, the question remains. When will US fathers break the cycle and say enough is enough? \r\n","link_id":"t3_v3ti","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166393414,"score":17,"ups":17,"author":"Sparky","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cv59d","parent_id":"t3_v3ti","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808779,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34535-afc27ae6-d0c9-4547-9cd1-7ba71196797c-1566236771"}

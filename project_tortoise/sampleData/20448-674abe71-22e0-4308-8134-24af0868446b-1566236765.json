Many prisoners get sentenced to years, if not decades, in prison for non-violent drug possession charges.  And even if you think that even non-violent offenders deserve the type of treatment seen in this video, do you really think that everyone in prison actually committed the crimes that they were convicted of?  The Innocence Project routinely gets the court to overturn convictions of prisoners that were sentenced to death by running DNA tests on old evidence and proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that they were not the person who committed the crime.  So as I see it, there's no justifiable reason why you can think this type of treatment is acceptable.","controversiality":0,"score":25,"ups":25,"created_utc":1165775373,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20448-674abe71-22e0-4308-8134-24af0868446b-1566236765"}

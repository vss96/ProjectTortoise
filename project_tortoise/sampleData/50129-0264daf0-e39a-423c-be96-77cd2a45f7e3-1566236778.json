{"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167082983,"body":"&gt;9) Atheists ignore the fact that religion is extremely beneficial to society.\r\n\r\n&gt;Those who emphasize the good effects of religion never seem to realize that such effects fail to demonstrate the truth of any religious doctrine. This is why we have terms such as \"wishful thinking\" and \"self-deception.\" There is a profound distinction between a consoling delusion and the truth. \r\n\r\n&gt;In any case, the good effects of religion can surely be disputed. In most cases, it seems that religion gives people bad reasons to behave well, when good reasons are actually available. Ask yourself, which is more moral, helping the poor out of concern for their suffering, or doing so because you think the creator of the universe wants you to do it, will reward you for doing it or will punish you for not doing it?\r\n\r\nA lot of words saying nothing. No rebuttal of the fact that religion is beneficial to society. Nothing but a weak reasoning that it's just good work for the wrong reasons. As a bit of a pragmatist, I don't care much for why but rather for the end result. \r\n\r\nBut beware, don't be blind to \"the truth of any religious doctrine\". I am personally always weary, when somebody says (or writes) \"the truth of X\". Not to say that the first paragrapgh reeks of the arrogance refuted in point 6).\r\n\r\nAh, well, who cares? Nobody are going to suddenly see the light or the self-delusion (depending on what camp you are in).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vx5n","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809372,"author":"Kolibri","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw08m","parent_id":"t3_vx5n","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50129-0264daf0-e39a-423c-be96-77cd2a45f7e3-1566236778"}

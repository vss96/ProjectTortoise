I once had the unpleasant task of having to install a few of their wireless cards.  Now, they have a nice undocumented feature where the driver tries to read your name from \"normal.dot\" (the default Word template).\r\n\r\nNaturally no one ever used Word from the admin account, so there was no name in the normal.dot file.  This caused an error.  Luckily they sort of handeled it.  So instead of a crash, I just got a screen full of error dialogs.  Plus a new one every few seconds.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44219-086d3154-9a4b-4492-bfcd-21b2728e452a-1566236774"}

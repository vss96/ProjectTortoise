I home schooled for a while but found I was not capable of teaching him and my son was so despratly wanting the school experience.   He is much happier at school and gets to interact with children of all ages.  For him I made the best choice.   He also had plenty of oppertunities to interact with other people while he was being home schooled but to him it was not same.  My nephew however is home schooled and loves it.  I think you must take each child's needs and personality into consideration before making such a decision.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uvo6","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166202632,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30842-fbfa341e-6dc1-42be-87c8-f0c3e9cb3817-1566236769"}

Otherwise, it looks like you're sacrificing some future intimacy for the sake of a little fun.\r\n\r\nIn those terms, I think there are similarities between the virtues of pre-marital abstinence and post-marital fidelity.  It's not an iron-clad argument, especially to someone in a 4-year relationship, but you didn't ask for ironclad, you just asked for decent, and I think it's decent.  I hope I speak for more than myself when I say it took me several tries before I lasted 4 years into a relationship (or 4 months) so if I'd been having sex with them each from early on it would be less unique with my wife.  Personally, I feel like it's something very special that only my wife and I share, and I'm glad she's the only one I've shared it with.  YMMV.","ups":12,"score":12,"created_utc":1166640511,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41427-4a19c60d-bf0e-461b-8837-5db21bbdc93f-1566236773"}

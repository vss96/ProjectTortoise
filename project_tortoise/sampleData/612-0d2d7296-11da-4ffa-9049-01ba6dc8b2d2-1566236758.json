{"controversiality":0,"body":"It's actually a really complicated and interesting issue. You got the thrust of it with your statement: \"While it is true that patents need to be protected for providing incentives for innovation...\"\r\n\r\nIn the past several years of the thousands of new drugs created, only a tiny, tiny fraction have been created specifically for the developing world. There's just no money over there for the companies to recoup their costs.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you say: \"How wlse can one explain that a one dollor a day anti-Aids drugs can be manufactured and marketed by Cipla profitably, whereas the Big Pharma charges atleast $400 for that.\" I agree that $400 is probably excessive. On the other hand, it takes on average about $800 million in R&amp;D to develop a new drug, which is more than Cipla makes in a year selling all their drugs. So the answer to how they can sell it for $1 is that they don't have research costs to overcome.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing is that when pharmaceutical companies *have* allowed for much cheaper selling in developing countries, those drugs always find their way back to the US.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t4oa","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164950273,"author":"losvedir","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ct6pb","edited":false,"id":"ct6yk","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807461,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"612-0d2d7296-11da-4ffa-9049-01ba6dc8b2d2-1566236758"}

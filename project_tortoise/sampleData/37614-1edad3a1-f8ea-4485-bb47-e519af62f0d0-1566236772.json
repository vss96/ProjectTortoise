Indeed, my family does an extended family gift exchange right before Christmas, just as described in the blog post. I suffer from a cousin who certainly feels entitlement to his gifts and displays an inappropriate lack of graciousness when a gift doesn't live up to his expectations.\r\n\r\nBut the author just sounds stupid complaining about it. She claims she'll be plenty happy if the spoiled niece doesn't like the gift card, but apparently not because the author just spent a half page complaining about it. Don't give her anything! Or if you're unwilling to suffer whatever consequences and strains that might put on interfamily relationships, then actually stop caring.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to be smug but there is an actual disconnect between the actions and the verbalized attitude. Seriously, she says she'll be happy to take the card back herself, then live up to that attitude and don't even write the rambling, complaining post in the first place. Or if you do actually care, then do something about and don't give her anything or have a talk with her or your husband's sibling.\r\n\r\nBut just a complaining narration of the event...why would we even want to read that?","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_va8f","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166505547,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37614-1edad3a1-f8ea-4485-bb47-e519af62f0d0-1566236772"}

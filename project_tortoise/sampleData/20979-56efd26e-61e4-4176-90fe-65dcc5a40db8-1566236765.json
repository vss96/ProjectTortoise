It is in the \"selfish\" interest of society to balance punishment with making sure it doesn't turn the punished into serial offenders or someone more likely to act against it.\r\n\r\nYou are right in pointing out that one can't change prison rules to address issues in the judicial system. I was wrong to bunch the two together. \r\n\r\nFinally, it is inevitable that most opinions expressed (written, spoken or via video) will be biased in some way, bcause human beings are biased. If we start ignoring every biased opinion, we will lose out on learning many important things that are wrong with the system. \r\n\r\nWe most likely wouldn't agree on what reasonable punishment constitutes. For example, if guards can separate out people and force them to undress and crawl, I'd say they are already in enough control to put those guys into something like solitary. And all accounts of prison I have read confirm that there is nothing like solitary confinment to break a man's spirit. \r\n\r\nBut I'd like to know if you agree that it is in society's interest to \"moderate\" punishment meted out to non-violent offenders.","link_id":"t3_ubo5","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20979-56efd26e-61e4-4176-90fe-65dcc5a40db8-1566236765"}

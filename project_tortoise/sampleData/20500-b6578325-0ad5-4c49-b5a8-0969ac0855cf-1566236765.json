By bunching the non violent criminals with the violent criminals and treating them all horribly (for safety of the guards) you are making sure the nonviolent criminals will become violent criminals. They'd have to for self defense in prison. You are also telling them that there's no difference between violent and non violent crimes, so you might as well do the violent crimes if they pay more. The net result is a higher number of violent criminals.\r\n\r\nYou (I assume) and I have never been to prison, so we don't know what X years of this can do to a person's psyche. But it cant be good. The main purported purpose of prisons is to reform. I don't see any reform happening here.","controversiality":0,"score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1165777099,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20500-b6578325-0ad5-4c49-b5a8-0969ac0855cf-1566236765"}

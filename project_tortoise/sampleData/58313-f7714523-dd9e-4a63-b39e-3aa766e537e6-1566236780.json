Why the haste to execute saddam? maybe they wanted to ring in the new year with some evil dictator blood – if that is the case, cheers you blood-thirsty bastards!– I guess the thinking is, there has been so much blood spilled, what’s a little more? Drink up! And when you’re done, chase it back with some e-coli infested water from the tigris – ahh, hits the spot don’t it? Yeah, nothing like a good ole execution to the start the year off right – its all down hill from here.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wf9e","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58313-f7714523-dd9e-4a63-b39e-3aa766e537e6-1566236780"}

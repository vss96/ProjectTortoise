Show me a subway system that has been produced by the private sector. It's impossible for private businesses to even build on-grade rail lines anymore.\r\n\r\nDefense -- Private companies can give a man a gun and train him. We have a shitload of private mercenaries in Iraq right now. Unfortunately, that model can never apply on a national scale and you never seem to have heard of the easy rider problem, though I'm certain that you'll now Wikipedia it and give it your insane Randroid slant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpaceflight -- Your claim about private sector spaceflight is one of the funniest things I have seen in awhile. The only things that private businesses bother to put into space are satellites because there is no money to be made from space exploration and scientific inquiry. SpaceShipOne made it into \"space\" in October of 2004, which was only *35 fucking years* after we put a *man on the moon.* Do you need me to list for you the number of achievements made by a government funded space program in comparison to the piddling gains made by the private sector?

Useful for locking mechanisms or state shifting gears within large machines. To get to babbage from this; you need both intention, and an engine based society. Without engines you can't mass produce, without mass production you can't scale out the repeated production of parts needed to get more bits of computing. Babbage built a calculating machine and attempted to design a *programmable* calculating machine. But it wasn't till the Anastoff and ENIAC era that this was really feasible. And once you are there you are just a Von Neuman away from modern machine design concepts.\r\n\r\nThinking about and using engines leads to thinking about power issues which gets you very quickly to electronics, which makes it possible to take mechanical computing and to shrink it to electronic levels where more computing is possible.\r\n\r\nSingle purpose calculation machines like the one in the article show vast intelligence, but with slaves running the pumps of society you never get to the really good stuff.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ttlc","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165430094,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11975-11a6a818-5bb8-4d7a-9281-d679e4e44c5e-1566236761"}

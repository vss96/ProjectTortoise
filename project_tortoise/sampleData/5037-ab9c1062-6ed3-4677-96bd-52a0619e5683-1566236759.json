Instead of popping up a pretty dialog with a nice picture of a bomb, spitting some hexadecimal numbers out and terminating the program, the Lisp system can provide the user with a number of (fairly) easily understandable restarts, such as \"abandon the command that caused the error\" or \"save all data to emergency file and quit\".\r\n\r\nOf course, this is hardly a user interface for the classic John Doe, but for a reasonably technical user it can be quite useful.","retrieved_on":1473807639,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctfpp","id":"ctge4","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Athas","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5037-ab9c1062-6ed3-4677-96bd-52a0619e5683-1566236759"}

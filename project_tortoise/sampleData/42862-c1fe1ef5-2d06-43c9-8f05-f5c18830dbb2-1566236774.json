Taoism was originally conceptualized as a philosophy when Lao Tze, the founder, wrote the infamous Tao De Ching.  The book by no mean is religious at all.  It just a philosophical book like \"Art of War\", except instead of war it contains observation about life, human nature and the universe.   After his death his follower glorified him.  Making him into a God and religious figure. They also invented other god like figure such as the \"Jade Emperor\". It accounts for most of Chinese superstiion.  This is also when the Tao Temple start to appear.  Over all Taoism is a philosophy more than a religion.  \r\n\r\n*Note (regarding Buddhism and Taosim): When Buddhism came to China.  The translator found many concept in Buddhism very similar to Taoism. So they used many language in Tao De Ching to translate the scripture of Budda.  As a result  Zen Buddhism  (which is practiced in China and Japan) also tend to be more a philosophical and less religious than it's original form. In fact there is an ancient Chinese proverb recited by many enlightened high level Zen Buddhist monk and Taoist priest, \"Taoism and Buddhism is the of the same family\". \r\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166689956,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvlpg","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cviau","author_flair_text":null,"author":"treenyc","retrieved_on":1473809095,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42862-c1fe1ef5-2d06-43c9-8f05-f5c18830dbb2-1566236774"}

Usury is prohibited by Christianity and for centuries was prohibited by the Catholic Church (it may still be technically prohibited today, although I don't believe excommunication is still considered a valid punishment).  Thus, Jews constituted Europe's only lenders before the rise of secular states.  Very few people love their bankers or lenders; in times of hardship (e.g. poor crops, war, sickness, etc.) many in-debted Europeans seized on anti-semetic pograms as a means for clearing their debt.  They were further aided by a popular culture (e.g. Passion plays, etc.) that demonized Jews and \"justified\" their murder.  Thus, what was financially convenient was also tacitly justified by the culture of the times.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33899-321eda6f-4f66-4987-85c4-e712d6ae49ed-1566236771"}

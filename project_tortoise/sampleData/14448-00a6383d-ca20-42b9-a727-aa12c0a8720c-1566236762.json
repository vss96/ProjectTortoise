But I suspect the majority will get the impression that math is something big and scary, and that even if you're really smart like Professor Nullity, people will sometimes yell at you and call you stupid. This will encourage the kids to pursue non-mathematical disciplines, in which it is harder to prove that a practitioner is stupid. I don't see this as combating the problem of innumeracy.\r\n\r\nReporters will probably take this to mean that they should avoid covering stories about math, which, again, doesn't help fight general innumeracy.\r\n\r\nThis generally seems rather unfortunate.","link_id":"t3_tzna","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808021,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"joom","id":"cu0xq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tzna","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14448-00a6383d-ca20-42b9-a727-aa12c0a8720c-1566236762"}

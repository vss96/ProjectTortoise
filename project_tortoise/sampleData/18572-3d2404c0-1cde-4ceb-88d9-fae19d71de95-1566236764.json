That is a charity where the salaries are the purpose. But in the report I saw, those WOULDN'T COUNT. Because they are spent on the cause. The salaries that were dminating are those of people 'back home.' In particular, people being paid commercial CEO-level salaries to run 'charities.'\r\n\r\nThe latest scam around Ontario is people selling chocolate bars for charity. Being PAID to sell them. For a chocolate company. Which gives less than 5% of the proceeds to a charity. The charities then spend &gt;95% on THEIR costs.

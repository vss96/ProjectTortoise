Diamond Miners are Disproportionately Exposed to HIV/AIDS\r\nMany diamond mining camps enforce all-male, no-family rules. Men contract HIV/AIDS from camp sex-workers, while women married to miners have no access to employment, no income outside of their husbands and no bargaining power for negotiating safe sex, and thus are at extremely high risk of contracting HIV.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like one of those fleshed-out BS points you'd add to make your high-school english paper longer, but I can sort of see some truth to it. I can't tell if they mean just *exposed* (which is sort of an arbitrary point, since miners are disproportionately exposed to many things compared to the general population) or if they're implying higher rates (in which case, I'm curious -- how much higher?). I'd love to see some sources on this. It's a fascinating point that I've never considered before.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_u6tj","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165665485,"score":9,"ups":9,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18257-8b6d22ef-1fd3-467c-9f08-075930690a56-1566236764"}

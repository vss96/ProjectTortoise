{"body":"From [Newsweek](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15856333/site/newsweek/):\r\n\r\n&gt; But Shahin, a lawyer, disputes many of these details. He says everyone in the group had round-trip tickets that he had booked—and that he has the documentation to prove it. The reason he was at the front of the flight was because he was upgraded to first class because he’s a frequent flyer on the airline. And the reason he asked for a seatbelt extension? Shahin says his 290-pound frame should make that obvious. As for the anti-American remarks, Shahin says the group was talking about the conference, which, ironically, was focused on building bridges to the non-Muslim community. And to avoid this very type of incident, Shahin says he’d already notified both the F.B.I. and local Minneapolis police department of the NAIF conference, as a precaution. “What they claim [in the police report] is just not true,\" he says.\r\n\r\nThe other first class Imam was blind.  But you know about those Terrist towelheads - they're Shaolin crazy!  \r\n\r\nEDIT: Provided link.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v7ee","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":23,"ups":23,"created_utc":1166470198,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jvance","id":"cv982","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv8ya","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808854,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36498-b13f58b9-432e-470d-8698-34bed6d47428-1566236772"}

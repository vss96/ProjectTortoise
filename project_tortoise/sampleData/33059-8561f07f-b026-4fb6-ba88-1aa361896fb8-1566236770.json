First of all neither any muslim child is spoon fed with the hatred to the jews nor the muslims have an agenda to wipe off all the jews. People like her dont have any other work rather than creating false sparks between communities. I stronlgy condemn her article and consider her a false source of any sort of information. If she can provide FALSE information to the Dutch goverment, how can anybody think that she has something very informative to share. \r\n\r\nCurrently when lts of problems are goin gon in this world, we should try to think about making new bridges between the communities rather that creating another MUSLIM-JEW wiping aoff issues. This is insane.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33059-8561f07f-b026-4fb6-ba88-1aa361896fb8-1566236770"}

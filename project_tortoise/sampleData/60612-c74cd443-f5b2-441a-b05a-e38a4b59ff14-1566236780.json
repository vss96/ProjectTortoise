{"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_wjhl","stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"body":"I have a theory that there are at least two phases of understanding REST. The first, which most people get very quickly, is the constrained interface/global naming constraint. The second (seemingly more elusive) aha moment is when you understand that hypertext is the engine of application state. \r\n\r\nReddit and Digg both support comments and yet there is no agreed upon CommentML or comment ontology. Similarly, Amazon and EBay take credit card transactions and do so without industry-wide consensus on how to do so. How does this happen? It's because all these sites use hypertext to send browsers instructions on how to formulate the correct formats (i.e. HTML forms) REST doesn't limit this type of interaction to forms (although they have some distinct advantages) - XForms, Applets, XUL, XMLHttpRequest, and XAML would and do also work just as well. It is this second property of RESTful systems that allows for interoperability in the face of unknown representation formats and URI structures.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167595111,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t3_wjhl","id":"cwki5","edited":false,"author":"mmcshane","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809754,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60612-c74cd443-f5b2-441a-b05a-e38a4b59ff14-1566236780"}

When I think of spinoffs from seemingly (socially) useless science, high-energy physics is what comes to mind.  Everything to do with NMR and MRI, which have been massively important in other fields, is thanks to that.  But the accelerator people are still riding that, as if accelerator physics has had any important spinoffs in the last 25 years (since it got really damn expensive).","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18467-81954a2b-52eb-4ce0-afc1-ec403b0fff40-1566236764"}

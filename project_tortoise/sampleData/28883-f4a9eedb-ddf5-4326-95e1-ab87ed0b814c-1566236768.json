Don't doing anything drastic...just allow your car to slowly coast to a ridiculously low speed.  They'll probably pass you (fine by me), or sometimes they'll back off to give themselves more room to pass, or in preparation of you possibly stopping.  Either way, as soon as they back off, resume speed.  You don't have to do it very many times for them to get the point.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can take the approach a friend of mine back in High School had: Keep a portable, powerful, battery-powered flashlight in the back seat.  When they roll up on you with their high beams on, just fire that sucker out your back window.  They catch on pretty fast.","link_id":"t3_upgw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808554,"distinguished":null,"author":"oditogre","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cutc0","parent_id":"t1_cusly","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28883-f4a9eedb-ddf5-4326-95e1-ab87ed0b814c-1566236768"}

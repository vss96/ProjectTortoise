{"body":"I thought this post was interesting; I think it's important to look at total compensation. On the flip side, however, what happens to the graph if we remove *only* health insurance from the compensation picture? My concern is that if we measure the *dollar* amount of health insurance as compensation, it skyrockets in the U.S. over the last ten years. But in terms of end-user benefit, health-care as compensation hasn't changed (from my perspective, health insurance simply allows me to go the doctor without writing a big fat check).\r\n\r\nWhat I'm getting at is that, adjusted for the increase in health insurance costs, we would see real wages falling slightly over the last few years, and real costs for employers rising slightly. (Anecdotally, I find this true - at my former employer, employees' salaries have stayed flat, while the health insurance costs are just killing the boss. Meanwhile, my United Health Care stock doubled in three years.)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u44z","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165599559,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"projectileboy","id":"cu53s","parent_id":"t3_u44z","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808098,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16449-296a0f93-0fe6-46a4-8cf3-e49b00c62a83-1566236763"}

The ratios you are talking about mean that the oil extraction process is 97.5% efficient, and the coal extraction process is 80% efficient.  That means we have to extract about 25% more BTUs of coal than we would oil in order to get the same amount of finished product.  With U.S. coal reserves, that is not a problem.  Now, burning all that coal isn't good for global warming, but that's really a separate issue.","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14736-787e1a1d-5b74-4a06-9c6a-7a165510dba5-1566236762"}

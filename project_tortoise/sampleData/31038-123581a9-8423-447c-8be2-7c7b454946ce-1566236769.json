{"body":"I'm going to be nit-picky here...\r\n\r\nIt's depends on the guns and on the .22LR ammo you choose. .22LR come in a variety of loads so you'll see a range of muzzle velocities. \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.22_Long_Rifle\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to find pellet guns with velocities in the low range of a subsonic .22LR. Look at this page for instance:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gamousa.com/Catalog.aspx?Product=133\r\n\r\nNow... it's probably safe to assume that the gun this kid found wasn't the high-end stuff on the link I provided. However, this gun does fire at 410 fps which is plenty dangerous and within the range of .22LR muzzle velocities listed on wikipedia.\r\n\r\nEDIT: forgot about pump pellet pistols. As a kid I used to overpump my pellet rifle and there was a notable difference in how far into a 2x4 the pellet would go with a few extra pumps of the rifle. I imagine that a pistol would be similar .\r\n\r\nhttp://www.airgunsbbguns.com/Benjamin_Air_Pistol_Pump_p/bnjhb22.htm","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uvo6","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":4,"score":4,"created_utc":1166207461,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"MelechRic","id":"cuxve","parent_id":"t1_cux4z","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808639,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31038-123581a9-8423-447c-8be2-7c7b454946ce-1566236769"}

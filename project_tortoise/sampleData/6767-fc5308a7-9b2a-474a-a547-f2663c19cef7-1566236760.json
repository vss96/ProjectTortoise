But making noise for noise's sake (a la cheap porn) is distracting and annoying.  I think all the talk of \"make a little noise\" that has hit the media the last few years has gone a step too far, and now some women are just ridiculous about it.  I mean, if you're just making noise because you think you're supposed to, why not do it by clapping to the rhythm?  Or whistling \"Jingle Bells\"?  Why is random moaning and groaning considered any less ridiculous?","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165248386,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctkep","parent_id":"t1_ctje2","author":"oditogre","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807714,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6767-fc5308a7-9b2a-474a-a547-f2663c19cef7-1566236760"}

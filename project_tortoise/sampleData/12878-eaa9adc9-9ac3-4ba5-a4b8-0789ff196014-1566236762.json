I guess I'm asking whether there's any chance based on previous legal precedent that the home-defender would get off free.)\r\n\r\nIt seems to me -- from my libertarian perspective -- that if anyone kicks open the door to someone's home and starts yelling and waving guns around, and then gets shot in the process, the shooter should be completely immune to prosecution. Even if the intruders are cops. \r\n\r\nAll you have to do is watch how quickly some of these things go down on shows like *COPS* to see that it would be easy in the heat of the moment for a resident defending himself to misunderstand initially that he was shooting at cops.\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807951,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_tw0u","id":"ctx5o","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dotrob","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12878-eaa9adc9-9ac3-4ba5-a4b8-0789ff196014-1566236762"}

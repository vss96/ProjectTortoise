The part about cramming is certainly not the most disturbing part of the clip. Notice that:\r\n\r\n* cramming is only done on migrating birds (well, on birds whose ancestors were migrating), because they're designed to support averfeeding before migration.\r\n\r\n* The best way to avoid animal suffering is to buy top quality meat, the kind which ran in fields before being slaughtered. Foie gras tend, on average, to be of much higher quality than other bird meat: if you want to tackle animal suffering, you'd better start boycott KFC. That would also probably be a healthier choice.\r\n\r\nI have a problem with unnecessary animal suffering, but not with the idea of cattle being killed for me to eat. I mean, the alternative for them wouldn't be to be raised lovingly by their farmer, it would be to never be born in the first place. And even if they were set free, they've evolved too much dependency upon the farm to survive by themselves.\r\n\r\nLike all animals, farm animals die. Like most animal except humans, they have a quick and violent death. And farmers are not shortening their life expectencies, they're augmenting it: cattle in the wild would be turned into savage dog food within days if not hours.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166819192,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":5,"score":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvs6l","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vqyl","author_flair_text":null,"author":"fab13n","retrieved_on":1473809219,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46096-f1d4ae65-46d4-4d9a-88b7-9515cb8fd5db-1566236775"}

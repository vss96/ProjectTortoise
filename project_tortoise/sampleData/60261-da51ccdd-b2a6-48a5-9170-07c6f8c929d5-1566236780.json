That would be a display of bias. Second of all, do you think that Dawkins really has no agenda? Third of all, it's easy to say that Dawkins would admit he's wrong if there's scientific evidence and a religious person wouldn't, because Dawkins is basing his arguments off of scientific evidence, and religious people are basing their arguments off of religious evidence. Hence, they are both *biased*. I'm not saying that belief in science alone is an indicator of bias. There are many scientists with far less of a bias, even atheist scientists, even religious scientists. Ken Miller is one of my favorite scientists on this topic (he's spoken out at length against ID) and he's Roman Catholic (not evangelical). But please understand, Dawkins is an extremist.\r\n\r\nedit: [this link](http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/2005/12/richard_dawkins.html) might do a little bit to explain why bias matters, even if you're willing to admit your mistakes when you're wrong with regards to science.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_whql","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167583382,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60261-da51ccdd-b2a6-48a5-9170-07c6f8c929d5-1566236780"}

In fact, he's holding up open source tools like `apt` as shining examples to emulate, while criticizing Mac OS X for not leveraging any of the strong package-management systems out there.\r\n\r\nAlso.\r\n\r\n&gt; This problem has largely been solved by Windows.

WIndows has always supported startup scripts.\r\n\r\nNice flamebait.

It's more a case of the silent majority, the only reason there's a stigma around it is because the only opinion that gets heard is the one complaining.\r\n\r\nI used to be in a class tipped about 10:1 ratio of female to males, usually a bad thing. One of the times when the conversation turned to sex, and didn't end with me shaking my head having learnt something that made me thankful of repression, was when it turned to the things we didn't like doing. It turned to both oral and anal, obviously, and about 5 (1/4 of the girls that were around) started talking about it and why, but the others were happy to just drift out of attention with sheepish, near identical, looks on their faces.\r\n\r\nBeing sparsly populated with males we turned out to be the Swedish, neutral territory, so I was just content to let them freely divuldge the information I found out that 10 of those girls liked both, so it's safe bet the others were either middle ground or on the side of liking it.\r\n\r\nHowever that information was retrieved for the good of Manity. When you find yourself telling your girlfriend how to handle period pains be afraid, be *very* afraid. I mustn't stress the miracles of repression enough.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3130-2cef892b-15b3-4859-abe2-d8dd11d2eb7e-1566236759"}

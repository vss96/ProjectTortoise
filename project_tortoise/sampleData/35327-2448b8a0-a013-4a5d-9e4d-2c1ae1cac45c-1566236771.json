I'm having trouble formatting in reddit...\r\nLet's consider the possibilities if someone is bullish on a stock (or at least indicates that he is on worthio):\r\n1. He buys the stock.  Then that information has already been incorporated into past price history.\r\n2. He doesn't buy the stock.  So here there are three sub-possibilities:\r\n  2a. He's lying on worthio.  It makes his opinion worthless.\r\n  2b. He is slightly bullish but mostly just guessing.  His opinion here is near worthless too.\r\n  2c. He has no money.  By the nature of being poor, he likely has little experience in the stock market making his opinion near worthless in this case.\r\n\r\nMore information only tends to be better than less if it is useful information.  Otherwise it just wastes people's time.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v4uc","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166425523,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35327-2448b8a0-a013-4a5d-9e4d-2c1ae1cac45c-1566236771"}

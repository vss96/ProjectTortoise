{"body":"It would be interesting to see how that $400 million will get taxed.  It looks like a mixture of income, capital gains, etc. so it is a bit difficult to understand what his after-tax income is from the article.\r\n\r\nIn any case, some of that money is going into the government coffers.\r\n\r\nI'm not so much bothered by a few super wealthy individuals as I am by a baroque, complicated, and in many ways regressive tax system.   If the tax system were 'fair' (and I know that is a complicated issue) then I really don't care if someone makes $1 million, $100 million, or $400 million.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I were an owner/investor in Exxon, I might think that the $400 million could have been better allocated.  But that isn't a tax issue.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vrfp","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166830263,"author":"gwright","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvrzm","id":"cvsr6","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809229,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46441-6cbdbe8c-09c6-42cf-bda8-8411fb46f684-1566236775"}

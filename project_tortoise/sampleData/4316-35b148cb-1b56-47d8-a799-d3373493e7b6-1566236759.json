In fact, there is no stable end-state (or non infinity game equilibrium).\r\n\r\nWhy? Imagine your bidding opponent bids £20, and your last bid was £19. If you do not bid, you lose £19, whereas the winner loses £0. If you bid £21, then if you win, you only lose £1. Hence you bid. But now your opponent will realise that if he bids £22, he will win at -2 but lose at -22. Hence *he* bids, etc, etc. \r\n\r\nThey ended up paying £39 and £40 pounds to the smiling professor :P","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807605,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctenb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tdu0","author":"plutocrat","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4316-35b148cb-1b56-47d8-a799-d3373493e7b6-1566236759"}

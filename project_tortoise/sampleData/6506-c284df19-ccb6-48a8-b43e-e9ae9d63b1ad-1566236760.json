Seems like a much simpler plan than nationalizing the whole industry. Everyone's costs will rise, of course, but then they will also under a nationalized health care system.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807702,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_tiu0","edited":false,"id":"ctjtr","author":"NoFixedAbode","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6506-c284df19-ccb6-48a8-b43e-e9ae9d63b1ad-1566236760"}

They aren't members of adult society, but rather have retreated into their own twisted subculture.\r\n\r\nI can see EXACTLY why someone would want to home school a child, specifically to insulate him/her from that degenerate and caustic adolescent subculture.  \r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166203785,"score":8,"ups":8,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30875-c318ffca-8819-49cb-a1b6-3094306a4ac4-1566236769"}

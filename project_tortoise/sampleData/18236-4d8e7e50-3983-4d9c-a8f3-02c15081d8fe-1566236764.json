One of the most important aspects of effective punishment of children is that the punishment should be clearly associated in the childs mind with the offence, which means warning them that the punishment will happen if they continue to behave a certain way, then ALWAYS doing what you said you were going to do.  \r\n\r\nThis firstly gives them the opportunity to improve their behaviour and avoid the punishment, and it teaches them that if you threaten a punishment, you mean it and will carry it out.\r\n \r\nJust mentally saving up 'badness' then maliciously ruining a kids christmas morning doesnt teach the kids much about their behaviour, or what they could have done to avoid the punishment.  All it teaches them is that their dad is an asshole that they should never trust again.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think the story is just made up to increase publicity for the auction.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u5rj","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18236-4d8e7e50-3983-4d9c-a8f3-02c15081d8fe-1566236764"}

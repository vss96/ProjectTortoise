The only thing that is said about the popular kids is that they are popular and get to party and do the things that most teenagers really want to do. The nerds aren't shown in any positive light, they don't party because they aren't invited, they don't have sex because they lack the social skills. They haven't abstained because of some moral superiority.\r\n\r\nThe only place that judgements are made is the theoretical outcome of nerds going to college, and cool kids dying young like rockstars.  Those have to be the outcome or else the article wouldn't make sense. Without those assumption the theme would be, the cool kids win in high school, and they keep winning throughout life. That's not the theme though, the theme is that not everyone peaks at the same time and there are some advantages to not being cool in highschool.\r\nI really think you are reading your own prejudices/hangups into this.","link_id":"t3_ux4j","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166210423,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31171-b7218e64-425f-4aa5-b32c-1606e6be2753-1566236769"}

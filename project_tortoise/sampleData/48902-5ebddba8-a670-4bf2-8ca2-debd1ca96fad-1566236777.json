{"body":"Well you are incorrect. \r\n\r\nLook at your own life. What keeps you from walking in front of a bus? Your personal intelligence.\r\n\r\nThat argument applies to all life. Living things use intelligence to allow them to accumulate enough energetic resources to reproduce. This isn't in dispute, even to most religious types.\r\n\r\nYou use a god idea to find a MEANING in that life process. This is where you stray from reason. I personally disagree with the article. Life has inherent meaninglessness. I feel that atheists SHOULD try to promote that meaninglessness, as if you truly develop that sense then you can understand the true preciousness of all living things in this world. By imparting meaning on to life you ruin it.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx5n","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-15,"ups":-15,"created_utc":1166991500,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"entropyfails","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvxqh","id":"cvxrg","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809325,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48902-5ebddba8-a670-4bf2-8ca2-debd1ca96fad-1566236777"}

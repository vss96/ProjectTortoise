Optimus-103 Keyboard\r\n\r\n&gt; Last year, we noted that the Optimus Keyboard -- an infinitely configurable input device with a tiny display screen on each key -- would be a strong candidate for this year's list because it was promised in 2006. Well, guess what -- it never arrived, so the Optimus earns a spot for the first time.\r\n\r\n&gt; Art Lebedev Studios, creator of the Optimus, is now promising the OS-independent keyboard in 2007. The studio also has a touch-sensitive device called the Upravlator that's supposed to ship next year. We'll reserve two slots on the 2007 list -- just to be safe.\r\n\r\n&gt; \"This is almost as vapor as it gets,\" reader Stav writes. \"From some nice-looking concept photos of a 'truly next-gen keyboard,' it's been delayed ever since announced. And the feature list just keeps getting cut, the latest cut being color keys in the first version.\"\r\n\r\nOh, if they actually cut the feature list instead of expanding it, there's a good chance they will actually deliver it one day.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54909-2b149fa4-b1e9-4f36-adc9-cd9d0a5056e9-1566236779"}

Russia has such a vast territory that they can retreat for years while increasing military production in the back. Russia has even [experience surrendering Moscow and still winning the war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia_%281812%29).  I would suspect that's what would have happened if USA/UK wouldn't  help with supplies in the beginning of German invasion of Russia. Russians would lose Moscow but stop the Germans later somewhere before Ural mountains in more wild territory.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u5eq","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808142,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cu7c2","parent_id":"t1_cu77y","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17834-1b77a584-2353-428a-976b-45e446d3b131-1566236763"}

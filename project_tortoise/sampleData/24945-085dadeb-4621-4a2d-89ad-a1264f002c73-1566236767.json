A number of other media outlets disputed the claims made by Hoekstra and Rick Santorum regarding the existence of weapons of mass destruction, reporting that the claims were disputed by both Pentagon officials and the intelligence community.\r\n\r\nOn November 3, 2006, The New York Times reported that a website created at the request of Hoekstra and senator Pat Roberts was found to contain detailed information which could help nuclear states produce nuclear weapons. The website was shut down on November 2 following questioning by the Times and protests by International Atomic Energy Agency officials. Jamal Ware, a spokesman for Hoekstra, said complaints about the site \"didnâ€™t sound like a big deal .... We were a little surprised when they pulled the plug\".\r\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia\r\n\r\nQuestion: Would you rather have an ex-corporate exec who patently plays party politics and advocates posting nuclear bomb directions on the web, or a purple heart vietnam vet who was unprepared for an interview?","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24945-085dadeb-4621-4a2d-89ad-a1264f002c73-1566236767"}

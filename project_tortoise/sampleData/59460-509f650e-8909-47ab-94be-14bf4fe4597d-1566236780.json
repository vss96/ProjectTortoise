{"body":"I personally consider cellphones to be one of the sorts of technology that, like DRM infested media players, de facto always belong to someone else. Whether it's the phone network or the government, the device was not built to take your orders except in a most superficial way.\r\n\r\nIf I want to speak remotely and with assurance against commercial snooping, I'd use Skype. It probably also presents a much higher, though not insuperable barrier to governments.\r\n\r\nIf I want to speak remotely and with absolute assurance against governments, I'd use open source SIP over OpenVPN.\r\n\r\nThe non-specialist nature of a laptop with wireless and a plain analog headset means that nobody has gone and put in any back doors specifically related to phone conversations. You pay for your security with bad ergonomics.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wi05","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167530501,"score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"JulianMorrison","id":"cwi9c","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wi05","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809711,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59460-509f650e-8909-47ab-94be-14bf4fe4597d-1566236780"}

Now I'm nearly done with a CS undergrad (a few years old), which has been a mixed bag of B's and melancholy, and A's and enthusiasm. This article is me to a tee, especially when it comes to programming.\r\n\r\nI think the thesis might be true of a much wider variety of programming languages and topics. I find lots and lots of wonderful gems, clearly the work of one man, but unpolished, unfinished, abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for the Lisp community to balance itself with respect to this problem goes hand in hand with all of our own struggles to do the same.\r\n\r\nSo, the problem with Lisp is the problem with (some peoples') human nature, and the one will be fixed when the other is fixed.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809080,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvkxx","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vk0o","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42465-a1cb0382-86fd-49bd-b9ea-3c3a354b47f9-1566236774"}

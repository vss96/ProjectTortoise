I can produce what I want quickly, my code is reliable and I can easily maintain it. I try to keep it nice and neat, essentially functional programming. However, sometimes PHP lib functions fail me, function names are not obvious, and I have the be honest, their is no programmer cred.\r\n\r\nWhere do I go, is python a good next step? I have tried ruby, I like the language, I don't like frameworks like rails. I like to build from the start. I loved eiffel in uni. I just know a lot of PHP and can do stuff quickly, I fear that learning period in a new language where I am learning syntax instead of the problem area I am trying to solve.\r\n\r\nAnyway thanks for your help, new year resolutions soon.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0co","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1167086621,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50204-3224eae5-454d-4d93-abde-288a551b3843-1566236778"}

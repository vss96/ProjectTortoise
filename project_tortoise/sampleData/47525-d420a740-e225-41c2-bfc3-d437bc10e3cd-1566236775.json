Originally it narrowly passed the House after one of those votes where the Republican leadership have to beat up on some members to get just enough votes, but then went nowhere in the Senate.  So Sensenbrenner attached it to a must-pass military spending bill, which then passed in the Senate after conference committee, with no Senate debate on the REAL ID Act at all.\r\n\r\nSensenbrenner, Mr. Patriot Act and Mr. REAL ID, has been the chair of the House Judiciary Committee... until now.  In the new Congress, he'll finally be in the minority.","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47525-d420a740-e225-41c2-bfc3-d437bc10e3cd-1566236775"}

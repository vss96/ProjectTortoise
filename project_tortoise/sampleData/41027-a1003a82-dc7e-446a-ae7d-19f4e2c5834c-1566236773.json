They all attempt to explain social phenomena in the best way possible.  Economics just focuses on, well, the economy, and has subsumed within it a number of fundamental tenets upon which the explanatory models it offers rely. \r\n\r\nMany of the issues debated in a politics or sociology class are debated in an econ class: assumptions to make of human and social behavior, empirical examples that back up offered explanations, how to test out new theories, applying theories, explaining exceptions to theories and offering a way for the theory may accomodate the exception or a new theory that is a better explainer itself, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fact that economic theories use a lot of math doesn't make them any less debatable in light of how successful it is in facing empirical scrutiny.  That is ultimately what any social science must answer to.  I mean, the math involved in making certain economic theories is really impressive... unlike the predictive reliability of the same theories, which hasn't always been particularly stellar.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41027-a1003a82-dc7e-446a-ae7d-19f4e2c5834c-1566236773"}

Then I realized ... wait, God wouldn't side w/ both teams.  SO I did the absolutely heretical!  In front of the entire team, I ended the prayer with \"in [my name] I pray, so let it be (translation of Amen)\".  Instead of Jesus' name, right?\r\n\r\nWe won.  I was expelled.  I became an atheist.  Now, 10 years later, I realize that I'm an incarnation of the Only God:  Life, ergo I am pretty much as good a source to pray to as Life itself, and my life is blessed.","score":-4,"ups":-4,"created_utc":1166720236,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvn80","parent_id":"t1_cvmd9","edited":false,"author":"hopeseekr","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809123,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43509-d973be2b-42fb-4984-90d6-b8651b4a26f1-1566236774"}

But mostly, incidents of rudeness to customers are merited. Who wants to lose their job because they don't feel like being polite without being provoked?\r\n\r\nI work in a library. It's amazing how rude people can be to librarians-- usually when we don't own a book, or it's checked out, or they don't understand that, even if we special order it from North Dakota, no, it can't get to Massachusetts the next day. But at least once a day, I get a patron who is \"having a bad day\" and is rude to me for no other reason.\r\n\r\nI don't care how bad a patron's day is. Someone once came up to the desk, furious that she had to wait for another patron to finish her transaction, and threw her library card at me.\r\n\r\nI threw it back.","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28116-105cae33-eab0-4668-8b8e-ac20aca2e722-1566236768"}

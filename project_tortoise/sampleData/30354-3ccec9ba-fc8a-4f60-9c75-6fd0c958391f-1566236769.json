Both were in [flagrant contradiction](http://bevets.com/evolutionbible.htm) to the Mosaic story of creation, and other Biblical dogmas that were involved in it, and are still taught in our elementary schools. It is creditable to the shrewdness of the theologians and their associates, the metaphysicians, that they at once rejected Darwinism, and made a particularly energetic resistance in their writings to its chief consequence, the descent of man from ape. ~  Ernst Haeckel  \r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_utjb","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30354-3ccec9ba-fc8a-4f60-9c75-6fd0c958391f-1566236769"}

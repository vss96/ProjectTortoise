There's no doubt that he wanted the Axis to attack the US, but he couldn't control what they did.  It was their own stupidity that caused Japan and Germany to declare war on the US.  \r\n\r\nHitler could have put up with US destroyers in the Atlantic, which weren't going to decide the outcome of the war, and Japan could have either backed off down in the war against China, or just invaded the Dutch East Indies and took the oil.  The latter option might have provoked a war, but US public opinion would not have been so hardened against the Japanese, and a negotiated peace might have been possible if they could have dragged the war out.  Look to Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq to see how little stomach the US has for prolonged war against people who never did anything to us.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808891,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvb65","parent_id":"t1_cv44r","author_flair_text":null,"author":"lysine23","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37523-e750af80-75e3-44fe-9bea-75b6fba6cea7-1566236772"}

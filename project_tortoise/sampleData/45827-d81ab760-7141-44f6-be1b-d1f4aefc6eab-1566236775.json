Otherwise, they're not really free at all - who's gonna say something offensive if they're going to get beaten up and killed for it?\r\n\r\nOn the other end of the spectrum, they should not be free from the consequence that other people choose not to associate with them.  That's impinging on *other's* freedom.  If you're a jackass, it's perfectly reasonable for other people to not want to hang around you.\r\n\r\nThe case in the article is an interesting area in-between.  You can't really do your job without associating with other people, and those other people might reasonably not want to be associated with your opinions.  On the other hand, if *nobody* will give you a job, that affects your ability to survive.\r\n\r\nRemember that the reason we protect free speech is precisely so we *are* offended.  Otherwise, ideas stagnate.  Non-offensive ideas at best make incremental progress; the really big revolutions have always been heralded by someone saying something incredibly heretical, and usually being burned at stake for it.  So we don't want to have to deal with offensiveness on a daily basis, and yet we don't (shouldn't?) want it removed from our lives entirely.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vqg5","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809209,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvrnq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvrio","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45827-d81ab760-7141-44f6-be1b-d1f4aefc6eab-1566236775"}

My local court's last day of work for the year was yesterday.  January 22nd could be the first open time slot they had but I don't know what the judicial calendar where he is looks like.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure it matters that the original judge is retiring at the end of the year.  I've often seen the original judges petitioned but it gets turned over to another judge to prevent conflicts of interest.  That may be the case here.  The article doesn't really say.\r\n\r\nIIRC, This is the third guy this year in New York that has proved his innocence with the help of the Innocence Project.\r\n\r\nStill, good for him for not giving up and good for the real killer's daughter for giving up her Dad's DNA.","link_id":"t3_vpfm","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809198,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"berberine","id":"cvr0r","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vpfm","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45453-21e8bef4-d02e-434f-a6f6-b58c7dd4726d-1566236775"}

{"body":"Another thing I noticed was that Hinduism definitely didn't start with the birth of Krishna. In fact, in Hindu mythology, Krishna comes in an era after Ram, and even Ram was just an incarnation of the Lord Vishnu, so Hinduism had existed much before that. But that's just the label for the event. When Hinduism started is mostly unknown, but 3000 BCE is probably close.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vgrv","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166659874,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"gabbar","parent_id":"t1_cviex","id":"cvkbr","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809068,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42157-085fa7f1-53f8-4034-b0e4-7b6545c094bc-1566236774"}

I mean, fuck, you _just said it_.\r\n\r\nI have said elsewhere that it is my assumption that Ford intended his comments be kept from public until after his death.  It's the only thing that makes sense.  Otherwise, you would have me believe that Ford wanted his comments\r\nkept sealed before his death for a news story, but not for a book.  Once your comments are out, they're out.  It doesn't make sense to seal them for one medium and not for another.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is the issue of presidential precedent.  If a living president had these comments published in a book while he was still living, he would obviously and visibly be breaking with the longstanding tradition of keeping their mouths shut on things like this after they leave office.  These are my reasons.  The article is not a holy book, I don't have to prove _everything_ solely from its sacred words for it to be true.\r\n\r\nYour \"he said his comments could be published at any time after his death\" != \"he said his comments could be published only at any time after his death\" is the most asinine argument I've ever heard.  Consider these examples:\r\n\r\n\"You may have dessert after dinner\"\r\n\"You can come after 6pm\"\r\n\"Your check can be picked up on Thursday or later\"\r\n\r\nIn each of these cases, you are supposed to understand that the opposite cannot be done.  You can't have dessert before dinner.  If you honestly interpret everything by your idiotic rule, you'd constantly be running afoul of what people gave you permission to do.  Quit being so damn stupid.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the \"though\".  Here's how I read the sentence, the italics are the things I changed for clarity:\r\n\r\n&gt; The Ford interview ... took place for a future book project, _and this isn't a book project, but_ he said his comments could be published at any time after his death.\r\n\r\nThe author is explaining why these comments are coming out in non-book form, not explaining to you that the book was supposed to come out at any time, regardless of when Ford died, but since he died, we can release the comments apart from the book, all with one little word.  You're trying to read _way_ too much into it.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8u1","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56646-176e1134-3bbf-41ab-9fce-4ab611d8dbfa-1566236779"}

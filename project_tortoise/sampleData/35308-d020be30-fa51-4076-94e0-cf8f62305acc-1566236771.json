We (atheists and other non-Christians) live in a society with about 90% Christians and, let's be honest, quite a lot of them are NICE..(to me at least, in spite of knowing about my atheism)\r\n\r\nLet's just work together with every other liberal (atheist, Christian, Muslim, Jew etc) in securing a secular society where bible-nuts like this teacher are not in a position to exploit their position to evangelize about their faith in non-religious places.. ie separation of Church and State..\r\n\r\nIf you read the article, the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, is a ***Rev.*** Barry W. Lynn.. This is definitely a step in the right direction \r\n\r\nAnd, although I (as an atheist) completely disagree with Rev. Lynn's religious dogma, that doesn't mean I will not support him in these clearly secular movements/organizations..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808805,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_v6h2","id":"cv6o2","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rocky_m","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35308-d020be30-fa51-4076-94e0-cf8f62305acc-1566236771"}

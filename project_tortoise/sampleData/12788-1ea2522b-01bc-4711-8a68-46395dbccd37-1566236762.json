Plus it adds up.  In a previous time, when I worked as a temp, I processed child support/IRS garnishment checks that came out of people's paychecks.  Gulf Coast petrochemical support company = lots of shiftworker men.  Some of them paid two, one guy three women off, and many of them had two kids.\r\nAll I can really say is that this is the type of thing that people should consider when they start thinking about having kids with someone.  Most people in this country don't even understand what a responsibility having a dog is, i.e. that they do not take into account that it's a living creature that will be around for nearly twenty years.\r\nAlso, as a side note, an at-home, involved father could easily spend more than seems rational on the raising of a child.  An afternoon movie here, a sporting event there, hell, gas to take them to a museum or a beach and it all adds up.\r\nProcreation is a serious financial and emotional responsibility and many people think nothing of it.  No wonder so many marriages fail.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvr2","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165450824,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":7,"ups":7,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12788-1ea2522b-01bc-4711-8a68-46395dbccd37-1566236762"}

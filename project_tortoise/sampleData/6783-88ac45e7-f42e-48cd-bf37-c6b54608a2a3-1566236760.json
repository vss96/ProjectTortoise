So Cuban doctors set up mobile clinics around Venezuala, treating the poor for simple and curable eye diseases that left thousands of them blind.  You could call that a smart move.\r\n\r\nCheering Castro has the beneficial side-effect of annoying the US, and getting it to behave like even more of a swivel-eyed bully.  Considering that many believe that the CIA was behind the failed coup to oust Chavez (defeated when the people stormed the government buildings), he has no great love for the Great Satan.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tic8","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807714,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctk3j","id":"ctkfm","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6783-88ac45e7-f42e-48cd-bf37-c6b54608a2a3-1566236760"}

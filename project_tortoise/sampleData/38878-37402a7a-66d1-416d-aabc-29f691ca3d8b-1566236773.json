It is a lot more complex than just saying that Social Security and Medicare are broken and blame it all on one group of people.\r\n\r\nSocial Security and Medicare are two very different systems, each one with its own set of problems.\r\n\r\nWith medicare, you have the massive amounts of paperwork, the insane amount of regulations, and the health care centers who have very little money to work with. Lawsuits are everywhere, and there massive fraud on the part of companies that represent the drug companies.  Plus, you have the money going from the people to the government back to companies.  Of course we have spent the Medicare money - on Medicare.  It is a big, fat inefficient system that gets bigger and fatter with each new law and new loophole.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166552740,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38878-37402a7a-66d1-416d-aabc-29f691ca3d8b-1566236773"}

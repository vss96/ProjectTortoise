And yet I'm using Python by preference ;)\r\n\r\nI don't care what language people use as long as they don't spread uninformed opinions about other languages (not just Lisp, but on this site Lisp seems to be a victim of ignorance more than most other languages).\r\n\r\nIt even irks me when people act like ignoramuses when it comes to Java. I don't intend to ever again write a single line of Java in my life, but I get annoyed at people who say things which are blatantly ignorant or wrong (eg \"Java is slow\", factually incorrect statements about GC, etc).\r\n\r\n&gt; The best answer this guy seems to have gotten out of Lispers was, \"well, it'd be trivial to implement\".\r\n\r\nAnd what would a Ruby advocate tell you if you ask them about a Ruby implementation of some library which does not exist? Whatever their response, they're unlikely to just code up the library for you; does this point to social problems in Ruby? And furthermore, because some Lisper decided that docstrings is trivial to implement, does it justify idiots writing weblogs discussing what they perceive are shortcomings of Lisp despite never using it?\r\n\r\nLook, just admit that 'paddy' is a moron who has no contributions or useful insights to share with the world.","controversiality":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165990636,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26494-ed9b5291-0ab0-481f-9354-87b827a6d325-1566236767"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"It's all a matter of word definitions.  Blame it on the English language, not on how scientists define their beliefs.  Not all scientists are credible anyways, some \"scientists\" are blathering idiots.  A high percentage of generic scientists do believe in God or higher entity.  A large percentage of scientists who belong to the Academy of Sciences (scientist-elites) do not believe in God.  Very few scientists believe in the Creationist/literal Bible God.\r\n\r\nHow would you describe me?  I don't believe in God (as defined by the Christian Church), but do not strongly disbelieve.  I believe that the world in general is better off for believing in a God, and so encourage non-critical thinkers to believe in what they will.  I disprove of people who take the Bible literally.  I think that if many people didn't believe in a God, they would be very depressed (life without meaning, nothing to live for, etc).  I think the likelihood that there is a God of any kind is almost nil, but am open to anyone who can overwhelmingly prove to me that there *is* a God.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tivn","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165256761,"author":"kermityfrog","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctl1i","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctksd","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807725,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7075-39493e9b-f08a-4015-b485-514c7cc1e636-1566236760"}

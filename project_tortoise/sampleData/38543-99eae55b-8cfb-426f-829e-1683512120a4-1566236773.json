Gave it up a couple years back now. I arrange for my \"stuff\" (mail, etc.) to be picked up by someone else. I've saved a bundle.  I'm a strong advocate of sustainable living, which includes live simple, consume less, grow your own and \"live local\".  So far, it's working.  I buy almost everything used, except toilet paper, socks, underwear and sheets. Garage sales are my friends, thrift stores too. I'm never truly broke, self employed and debt free.  But I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but I do think that this is a lot to this way of life that is going to soon be necessary for millions more people.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v95u","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166546051,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38543-99eae55b-8cfb-426f-829e-1683512120a4-1566236773"}

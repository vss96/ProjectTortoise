Sorry Jerry copyright is dead. The value that publishers apply to books is largely marketing and retail channel connections. The value in older works is in the public mind share. For example I hadn't heard a peep from Jerry since I stopped buying PC trade mags in the mid 90's, where his column was often bundled. I didn't really feel like he had a lot to say even then.\r\n\r\nI had no idea Jerry wrote books. Would have been nice to link to them from the site somewhere. Would also be nice if he had someone format his site so it was more useful. Jerry should take a page from Cory Doctorow and put his books on the web and put a pay pal link. I bet he would make more in revenue that way then he does currently from royalties.\r\n\r\nAs for a long term copyright solution? Its going to be open your gates to the world or be forgotten. No one is going to pay for information in a networked age. The will pay for ability, for sure, but not for information. What publishers want is mindshare, and there is no way to monopolize that and have an internet at the same time.","retrieved_on":1473808994,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvgjb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_veme","author_flair_text":null,"author":"smacfarl","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40327-f5efb910-3916-47e5-bc21-3f36c013b71c-1566236773"}

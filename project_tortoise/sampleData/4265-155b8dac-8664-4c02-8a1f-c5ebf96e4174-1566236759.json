{"body":"Bond does not say \"Shaken not stirred\" in Casino Royale because it did not appear until the fourth installment of the Bond series, \"Diamonds are Forever\" (1956). The screenwriter was just being faithful to Ian Fleming's creation, and not to the over the top image that the franchise has had up until this \"back to the basics film\". Which for me was a refreshing change, because it is not now about an invisible car with rockets but instead is about a realistic MI6 agent, named Bond, James Bond.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_rkt3","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165111833,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"ctejp","parent_id":"t1_crlq6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807603,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4265-155b8dac-8664-4c02-8a1f-c5ebf96e4174-1566236759"}

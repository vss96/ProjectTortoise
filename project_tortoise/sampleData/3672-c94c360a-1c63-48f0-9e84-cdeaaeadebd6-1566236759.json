Celibacy.\r\n\r\nNo, really.  Not having sex for weeks at a time makes the whole world a little funny colored.  Everything gets a little sexual charge.  Hell, guys hit on me more- prolly something to do with all those pheromones.\r\n\r\nAll of which is true, but my point is, what people get out of something varies from person to person.  I love a little rough sex, giving and taking it.  My idea of rough sex prolly varies from yours.  And why the fuck shouldn't you negotiate verbally?  That is not a romance killer.  That's called talking dirty, and as it happens, this little girl likes that too.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tcpy","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":17,"ups":17,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165090052,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3672-c94c360a-1c63-48f0-9e84-cdeaaeadebd6-1566236759"}

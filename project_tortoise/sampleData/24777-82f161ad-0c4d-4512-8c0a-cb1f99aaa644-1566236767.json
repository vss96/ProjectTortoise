At its base level, this code...\r\n\r\n&gt;var aa = from c in CustomerList \r\n    where c.State == \"CA\"\r\n    select c.FirstName, c.LastName;\r\n\r\nThis works better:\r\n\r\nselect FirstName, LastName from CustomerList where State = \"CA\";\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n\r\n1.  It works no matter what programming language you use.\r\n2.  You can abstract your code from your database queries.  So if your database changes, which can be frequent on some projects, you aren't chasing down bad code.  An interesting note about LINQ: it won't tell you if your query is bad during compilation.\r\n\r\nLike I said before, writing queries in the code is old stuff.  Hell, even PowerBuilder did it years ago.  And there is very good reasons why they are kept separate.  Recent years have produced a ton of \"object wrappers\" like Hibernate.  Again: failures.\r\n","link_id":"t3_tzu7","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24777-82f161ad-0c4d-4512-8c0a-cb1f99aaa644-1566236767"}

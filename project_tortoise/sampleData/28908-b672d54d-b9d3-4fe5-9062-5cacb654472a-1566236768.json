{"body":"I use only the drive-thru at McD's, and I've found an almost sure-fire way to get pleasant, speedy service: 1) Know what you want when you get to the speaker station thing, and 2) Have money ready to pay.\r\n\r\nMcD's, and most fast food places in general, have had basically the same menus for each respective place for years now.  Why do I always see people sitting there staring at the menu and thinking, or just beginning to dig through their jockey box / arm rest compartment for cash when they get to the pay window?  (If you hadn't noticed, despite never having worked fast food myself, this still ranks as one of the big 'WTF?' issues in life to me...)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_upgw","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1166130589,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"oditogre","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cus7q","id":"cutd7","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808554,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28908-b672d54d-b9d3-4fe5-9062-5cacb654472a-1566236768"}

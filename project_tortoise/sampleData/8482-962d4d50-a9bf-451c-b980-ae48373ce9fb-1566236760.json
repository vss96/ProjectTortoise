(In basically the same manner as defining the Prime Merdian to be the line running from North Pole to South Pole passing through Greenwich, England.) Thus, the Alpha and Beta quadrants are the area where most of the series takes place, because Sol is right on the border between them.\r\n\r\nThe borders for the Gamma and Delta quadrants are, as a result, the 90 degree perpendicular lines from that line, also starting at the galactic core. Since Sol and its neighbors are out in the arms, this makes the Gamma and Delta quadrants literally on the *opposite side of the galaxy*.\r\n\r\nWhere's the area that hasn't been explored? Well, I didn't get very into Enterprise, but given the relatively small (galactic) area covered by the known races, there still remains a great deal of the Alpha and Beta quadrants to explore. Just because England happens to be in both the eastern and western hemispheres (because the dividing line runs down the middle) doesn't mean that you can see the whole of both hemispheres just by visiting England.\r\n\r\nAnd Enterprise was really *really* awful by the way. They intentionally and publicly set a show in the past of the solid, richly detailed Trek universe and admitted they would pay no attention to continuity. And they were true to their word. As a result, the overall continuity of the Trek Universe is a lot less broken if you simply ignore that Enterprise ever happened.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tmap","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8482-962d4d50-a9bf-451c-b980-ae48373ce9fb-1566236760"}

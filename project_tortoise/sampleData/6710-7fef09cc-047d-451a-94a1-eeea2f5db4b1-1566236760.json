As it is, though, I prefer about a 10 to 12pt font, 3/4 page width or so, single spaced.  Every time I have to scroll, it breaks me away from reading, which slows me down.  Cram that shit in there; like I say, I can adjust if it's too tightly packed, but rarely do I find a site where that is an issue.  I like as much information as I can get at once, thank you.","controversiality":1,"ups":-1,"score":-1,"created_utc":1165246640,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6710-7fef09cc-047d-451a-94a1-eeea2f5db4b1-1566236760"}

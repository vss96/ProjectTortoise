The registrars would be extending trademark-like enforcement to the web space, but without the usual well-defined procedures. This, tell me I'm wrong, would put the registrars at legal risk.\r\n\r\nSay I created the site, hotllamas.com. Now say that it became wildly popular. Do I now have the right to compel the registrars to *preemptive* refuse all registrations that remotely resemble the name of my site? What about existing domains that could be used for phishing?\r\n\r\nThere have been numerous legal battles over ownership of domain names. I don't think this policy would be as risk-free, or even legally sound, as this article makes it out to be.\r\n\r\nShould laws be made to specifically enable the registrars to do this? God, I hope not. Vague legalities made out of desperation always seem to screw over the wrong people in the end.\r\n\r\nThere are technical solutions to this problem. The best, however, do not lie within the registrars' territory.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807928,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctvur","id":"ctvx3","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12325-c40ad504-a5e3-4695-b2b4-87245d308847-1566236761"}

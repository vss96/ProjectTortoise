{"body":"In fairness to NASA, the reason why we plateaued is that rocket fuel hasn't improved since the 60s. Going from zero to the moon in a decade and a half was basically a matter of mastering the rocket fuels then invented by adding guiding systems and whatnot to make sure the rockets didn't blow up on the pad. We've now got the blowing up on the pad problem under much better control, but since we don't have new rocket fuels, we can't haul much more into space than we could in the 70s. (Less depending on which numbers you compare the Saturn V and the Shuttle on.)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vmnp","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166747485,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"earthboundkid","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvp8h","parent_id":"t1_cvos7","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809164,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44637-a7abc2a3-5822-4332-b130-f12efc25d0a1-1566236774"}

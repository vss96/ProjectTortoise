Thank goodness my parents were college graduates, and let me know I was right; how many of her working-class kids left knowing incorrect grammar? Most of them, probably.  This same teacher gave a friend of mine an A for a paper written as a gibberish of large words.  Evidently she didn't know them, and couldn't be bothered to look 'em up.  \r\n\r\nYes, there are some qualified teachers.

It's full of pure gold like:\r\n&gt;Hello, I'm American. What I'd like to do now is dribble out some pop psychology I saw an airport paperback writer talking about on Oprah once and which I've slavishly used as the basis of my whole life since because I really can't go to the effort of thinking anything through for myself. Clearly, I don't have the reading skills or the intellectual depth to claw my way above the crashingly literal, so I'll use this embarrassing lack of subtlety as a misplaced springboard from which to launch into a critique of your relationship. I'll probably say something like, 'For the sake of the children', I simply won't be able to stop myself. Depending upon how I feel, I might even state that, 'I have a good sense of humour' too, a fact which, tragically, I, myself, genuinely believe to be true. Can I have a 'I Don't Get It' badge please?","score":17,"ups":17,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165225035,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctj6k","parent_id":"t1_ctitl","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"emiller40","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807691,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6261-15a9ca74-aea3-459b-b1dc-07a081000e9d-1566236760"}

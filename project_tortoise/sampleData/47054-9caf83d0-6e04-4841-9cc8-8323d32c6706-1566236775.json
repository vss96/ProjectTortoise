It would be nice if people in general could reserve judgment a bit more when it comes to rape accusations.  \r\n\r\nWe should presume 'innocent until proven guilty' for both the accusers and the accused.  I do however think that DAs should be a bit more selective when determining which rape cases to try.\r\n\r\nI know people who have been raped, and it drives me crazy when people trivialize rape, however I also have a cousin currently in jail for a year on rape charges, though he is likely innocent (he was accused of rape by a girl who has accused 3 other people of rape, and all of the cases were dismissed...he was offered a 'great' plea bargain, couldn't afford a real lawyer, and didn't want to risk actual prison time by going to trial).","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166864674,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47054-9caf83d0-6e04-4841-9cc8-8323d32c6706-1566236775"}

However, it should be noted from the Wikipedia article that:\r\n\r\n&gt;*[Subaru]* is currently an affiliate of Toyota Motor Corporation, with them owning 8.7% of FHI. They acquired that stake from General Motors, who bought 20% of FHI in 1999 to have an extended presence in international markets, and collaborate technologically with FHI. Before that, the stake owned by GM was owned by Nissan, who acquired the stake around the mid-1980s in order to utilize FHI's bus manufacturing capability. In turn, many Subaru vehicles, even today, use parts from the Nissan manufacturing keiretsu. In fact, it was Subaru that introduced Renault to Nissan when they asked for assistance in all-wheel drive (AWD) technology, when FHI told Renault to discuss their plans with Nissan, the discussions eventually led to the successful Renault-Nissan alliance.\r\n\r\nSo it sounds as if GM still owns 11.3% of FHI which is more that Toyota's 8.7%.\r\n\r\nI've always been intrigued by the ideas I have seen from Subaru but the experiences of several friends with their Brats has made me unwilling to give them a try.","retrieved_on":1473809761,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cwkx6","parent_id":"t1_cwjjv","edited":false,"author":"keylime","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60894-535fe9f4-f04f-4249-9c8e-71b266ae46f5-1566236780"}

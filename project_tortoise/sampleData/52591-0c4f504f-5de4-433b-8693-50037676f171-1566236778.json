Iran wants both! And i personally think that the first priority is weapon. Please notice that nuclear weapon technology and nuclear energy technology are different. They need different level of Uranium enrichment. And plutonium is not needed at all for nuclear energy. And Iran now with all it's centrifugas is enriching Uranium for nuclear weapon purposes. And while I personally do not object their nuclear energy program ( I even don't think that I have any right to object to that), I strongly against that they will have nuclear weapon. So all the arguments if they want weapon or energy make me laugh.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167207464,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_w2ge","id":"cw4ok","edited":false,"author":"marglexx","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473809456,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52591-0c4f504f-5de4-433b-8693-50037676f171-1566236778"}

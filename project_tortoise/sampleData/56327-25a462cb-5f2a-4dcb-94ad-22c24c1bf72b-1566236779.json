Even if Nestlé own Milka (which sounds likely given Nestlé's size) it's not the same product as the Aero we have on sale in the UK at all. \r\n\r\nThis is the real Aero that's been on sale for years... \r\nhttp://www.nestle.co.uk/OurBrands/AboutOurBrands/ConfectioneryAndCakes/Aero.htm\r\n\r\n\r\nI've never heard of that Milka Aero in the UK, but I know they're hot on the Milka stuff on the continent. \r\n\r\nThere was another a few years ago - called Cadbury's Wispa - it got discontinued because it was losing out to the Nestlé Aeros, which is a shame because Wispas were far far nicer, decent chocolate instead of that waxy crystally shit that Nestlé sell.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wbvo","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809594,"author":"olli666","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwbxw","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wbvo","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56327-25a462cb-5f2a-4dcb-94ad-22c24c1bf72b-1566236779"}

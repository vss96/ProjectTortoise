It has changed a lot since then.  20 years ago it was hard to find philosophical homeschoolers (rather than religious ones.)  Now, I know a single mother who is homeschooling her kids well. I actually know parents who are just barely scraping by who manage to homeschool their kids. \r\n\r\nPositive articles like this one inspire people to at least begin to contemplate the issue. Then, they choose to do what they feel is right for their children.  This often involves making do with less.  But, these are some of the most creative, inspired homeschoolers I know.  They can't buy fancy curriculums or travel the world.  They have to use local resources like libraries and museums.  \r\n\r\nI have long been concerned that homeschooling is an elitist choice.  And I've had to do some soul-searching about my responsibility to the community versus to my family.  The great thing about the homeschooling community is that has become much, much more diverse.  African-American unschoolers rose by 8% last year alone.  But - it took a community of people who felt they could \"afford\" to do it to begin to reach out to others.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809538,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cw90b","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw7h3","author_flair_text":null,"author":"svaha","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54859-177100c6-2358-45bc-b791-5ac9d841cc66-1566236779"}

Then honest people could express themselves on the one aspect while having the concerns separated. I have to believe that most people just need that bit of help keeping the concerns separated, and wouldn't deliberately abuse the 'low quality' rating. \r\n\r\nOf course they might, but no site I've seen has implemented it. It's an opportunity for reddit to be the first, and it may need it if it wants to avoid digg's fate while becoming more popular.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808337,"gilded":0,"id":"cuhpa","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uhef","author_flair_text":null,"author":"not_fark_or_digg","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23346-3436ca68-ac3c-4fb0-88e9-fe2d9cce6792-1566236766"}

My parents will hear nothing of it, and insist on some materialistically inspired bauble or gadget. I mean, hand-made mittens? I'd *love those*--my hands are freezing up here in Canada. Even a book would be nice. But not another USB something-something or an extra [witty] T-shirt to overflow my dresser. I don't need any more stuff--hell, I have an entire section of my room cordoned off as \"to sell, or if that doesn't work, throw out.\" I *was* spoiled, I know.

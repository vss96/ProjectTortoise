While far from debilitating, it definitely affects the way I interact with people and conduct myself.\r\n\r\nIronically, one of the things I love to do (and have been repeatedly called 'good at') is cooking.  The net result is that all my food has to be *very* strongly-flavoured; although I'm certain that my perception of it is entirely different than most people.\r\n\r\nThere are some serious downsides, though: for example, I can turn the gas stove on and never know that the room is filling up with methane (yes, I know the scent is added).  Even more frightening, I can never tell if that fart I dropped was naughty or nice.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809518,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w6lz","id":"cw7te","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54326-84f23776-f165-4ad3-a676-3f7e6b3da41d-1566236779"}

This is despite the fact that terrorist attacks against Western interests (not just the US) are overwhelmingly committed by Muslims and that anti-Western rhetoric emanates overwhelmingly from Muslim sources.\r\n\r\nThe West really doesn't want to wage war against all Muslims.  Westerners are practically begging for moderate Muslims to publicly and unambiguously denounce the extremists that call themselves Muslims.  The West struggles to isolate and attack the extremists while leaving moderates Muslims alone.\r\n\r\nBut the longer it takes for the moderates to denounce, expel, eliminate, or otherwise separate themselves from the extremists the more likely it is that at some point the tide will turn and the West will no longer bother to try to identify the moderates from the extremists.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that many moderate Muslims are threatened and intimidated by the extremists and simply don't feel that they can risk speaking out. But unless they find a way to do so, they are putting their fate in the hands of the extremists.","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166500157,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cv8j5","id":"cvb2t","edited":false,"author":"gwright","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808890,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37476-691112f1-30fb-43de-bb85-18031dc020b8-1566236772"}

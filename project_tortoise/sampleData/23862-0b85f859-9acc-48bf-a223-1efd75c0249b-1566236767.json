Stuff that isn't garbage does occasionally appeal to 13-year-olds.\"\r\n\r\nHow exactly did the MP3 players before the iPod suck?\r\nCreative made great MP3 players before the iPod came and Apple stole the entire navigation concept from them, Apple slapped the touch interface on the hierarchy-based file system made by Creative and used by them and called what was essentially Creative's UI their own. If you don't believe this, Apple even settled with Creative on this particular lawsuit. Not to mention the brand \"nano\" was used about a year before Apple's iPod nano was released on a, yes, Creative MP3 device and through some legal tactics Apple was able to secure it for themselves only and Creative had to change the name of their own device.\r\n\r\nFor the record, Creative's MP3 devices have always surpassed the iPod in features, sound and screen quality (the Zen Vision line).\r\n\r\nIt's funny, then, when one of Apple's most popular products itself has very derivative elements, and then Mac fans and people cry foul when Microsoft takes a measly icon from them for use on their website.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808355,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_ugs5","id":"cuil7","edited":false,"author":"gumjo","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23862-0b85f859-9acc-48bf-a223-1efd75c0249b-1566236767"}

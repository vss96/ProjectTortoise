How many times have the US air force claimed something wasn't what everyone else thinks it was? Sometimes it's obvious it's not a flare or weather balloon or swamp gas. So obvious that the military spokesman or woman is probably having a hard time of keeping a striate face themselves (that doesn't mean I think it was aliens).\r\n\r\nI think most (intelligent) people realise the military tries to spread disinformation about it's operations, top secret or not so. However conspiracy nuts have probably increased the comedy value of this joke by forcing the air force to come out with more denials and explanations than they otherwise would have.\r\n\r\nI don't know why anyone would take this even remotely seriously anyway. Not many conspiracy nuts would claim the air force were covering up bat man's existence. Surely people can see the silliness?","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809558,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw934","id":"cwa1t","author":"richiejp","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55351-2db1db5c-861f-4ddd-b738-a5abc2483f68-1566236779"}

One thing that struck me was when he shared with people about what he was doing, and he noted that a lot of these people who were presently well off did have times in their life when they were forced to live like this.\r\n\r\nAnother thing of note was the preparation time for the beans, you can reduce that by bringing them to a boil and then soaking them for a day instead of trying to soften them for an hour on the fire.  A lot of that heat is just being wasted.\r\n\r\nIt would be more interesting to see someone who is proficient in the kitchen try such an experiment.  I was thinking the other day that it would be nice to have some type of chart that showed you the most cost efficient way (noting energy costs as some commenter added) to get your RDAs.  I suppose I should check with the FDA, perhaps the food triangle is just the beginning of a trip down a magical rabbit hole.\r\n\r\nRespect.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807531,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_t9us","edited":false,"id":"ctaqe","author_flair_text":null,"author":"arthurz15","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2501-761ca429-a6eb-41bf-b139-d6d54cc2de6c-1566236758"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"In KIPP the teachers function as parents, so the idea that kid's can achieve without parental involvement doesn't hold up. The school day is way longer than the average school day, and they only get one month of summer vacation. In addition, the teachers are on call up to 16 hours a day so the kids can call them any time with questions. They basically function as surrogate parents, and make up for the lack of parental involvement. So if anything, KIPP proves that a parental figure IS necessary for success.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w17r","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167147440,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"author":"Alex3917","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cw1i7","id":"cw2ab","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809411,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51223-08cca16f-feca-44c2-ae22-547bf88325a4-1566236778"}

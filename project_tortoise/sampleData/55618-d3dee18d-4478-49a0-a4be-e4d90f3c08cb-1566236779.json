{"body":"Is anything that he did actually patently illegal? Certainly it disrupted their business, but he did not destroy any property. The details get a little fuzzy on the remotes (did he actually \"steal\" them, or did he simply hide them until he came back to pick them up?) but it seems that about all Wal-Mart could tag him with is minor shoplifting, but even that stuff he gave back. The rest of what he did is certainly malicious, but I don't think he really broke any laws.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w94g","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167342654,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"cwalf","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwa4x","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809568,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55618-d3dee18d-4478-49a0-a4be-e4d90f3c08cb-1566236779"}

Did you miss the part of the article that talked about this?  From the section called \"Other solutions to the strings problem\":\r\n\r\n&gt; In the database-programming world, many programmers have adopted the convention of never inserting a string into a SQL template by hand. Instead, they insert placeholders, typically question marks, into a template ...\r\n\r\nRegarding the claim that \"It is trivally easy to handle this just by using stored procs or parameterized queries,\" how do stored procs or parameterized queries solve XSS vulnerabilities?  Or detect mistakes when mixing URLs and XML?  Or prevent double-escaping problems, such as the one that causes [less-than signs to be mangled in quoted code snippets right here on Reddit](http://programming.reddit.com/goto?id=qvsn)?  \r\n\r\nPlease understand that the strings problem encompasses more than SQL injection.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments.\r\n\r\nCheers.  &amp;#8212;Tom\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tzjq","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_3b8o","subreddit":"joel","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165563248,"score":4,"ups":4,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15567-f63ab262-5b2f-44db-9a35-8aa028c8d3c6-1566236763"}

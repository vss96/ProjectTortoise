Maybe I'm just horribly unlucky or something.\r\n\r\nIt has been my experience that software projects in general - not just Linux distributions or Ubuntu - have this problem. That Ubuntu has it seems about normal. That you've run into it each time is weird but not unexpected.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I am still considering moving to slack as package management through apt makes most of the easy cases dead simple and some of the harder cases downright impossible. Or at least it do so for me, maybe the system isn't the problem here.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9781-6cd181ba-7214-4f09-8b08-7def8214ddff-1566236761"}

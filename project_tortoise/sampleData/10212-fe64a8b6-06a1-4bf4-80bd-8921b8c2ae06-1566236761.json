It only gave rise to communism in russia and china\r\n\r\nYou see? It's historical observations like this on that keep me replying to you. I'm just always curious to see what you'll come up with next, and indeed you never fail me :)\r\n\r\n&gt;Let's forget all the rest of the shit OK\r\n\r\nNo, why forget? On the contrary, let's expand on that, please! I can't wait to hear your take on other events of the 20th century.\r\n\r\n&gt;I try to speak at the level the republitards understand\r\n\r\nWell maybe you could try that when you actually talk to \"republitards\", but I'm afraid there aren't many in Reddit. Personally I'm closer to Democrats' views on most issues, but that doesn't make me more tolerant to ignorant lunatics, just because we happen to vote for the same party now and then.\r\n\r\n(btw, I loved how you [sent](http://reddit.com/info/tk3l/comments/ctn9w) atlemk to learn about his own country's regime from the CIA factbook. I thought it was a really inspired touch :))\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807848,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctrl2","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctre1","author":"bhr","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10212-fe64a8b6-06a1-4bf4-80bd-8921b8c2ae06-1566236761"}

He compared that difference with a difference coming from a completely unrelated theory.  This comparison does not make sense.  There is no theoretical reason why this kind of comparison should make sense, and there are actual cases where it cannot make sense, some of which I pointed out.\r\n\r\n&gt; Off by that much?\r\n\r\nI think I misunderstood you.  I thought you meant \"that much or more\", which is why I gave the examples I did.  I do not know of any 'off by precisely 10^5' in physics, however it is simple to generate them.  The method of generating them is ad hoc, unconvincing and arbitrary, which is a reflection of how ad-hoc, unconvincing and arbitrary the ratios are themselves for providing a useful inter-theory comparison.\r\n\r\nPlanck's constant was zero in classical physics and 7x10^{-34} in quantum mechanics.  There is another, lesser known, constant of physics, sometimes called \"acrophobia's constant\", which is defined to be  \r\n* A = h + 7x10^{-39}.  \r\nIn classical physics, A = 7x10^{-39}.  In quantum physics, A = 7x10^{-34}.  The ratio of these two is, shock horror, 10^5.\r\n\r\nPresumably you are going to tell me this is just rank stupidity, but please, first tell me which part of \"Dawkin's method of inter-theory comparison\" am I misusing?","retrieved_on":1473809631,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwdo9","id":"cwdwu","author_flair_text":null,"author":"acrophobia","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57287-0203ec61-a979-41ae-a4df-80a27a1bf50b-1566236779"}

Seriously, there are no good reasons to be on the moon in the near future.  The \"spin-offs\" arguments are bunk; yes, if you spend all your money on a cheese-in-the-sky technological project, there are bound to be spin-offs.  There are also spin-offs from work on problems that matter (for example, the linked problems of energy and climate change).  But in the latter case, you also get spin-offs *and* a useful main project.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808133,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu6u8","parent_id":"t3_u5vc","author_flair_text":null,"author":"ragesoss","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17502-5b110dc5-b455-4546-8344-1b21ca570066-1566236763"}

Because I can't imagine they've actually lived in a secular country with a sizeable muslim minority. I hardly can imagine they've even had muslim neighbours, coworkers or friends.\r\n\r\nI live in such a secular country with a large muslim minority, and to me these ideas about muslims infiltrating and conspiring, acting as one, seem utterly implausible. They disregard the fact that within a generation, most immigrants become pretty much as secularised as the society in general (if they weren't already secular, many actually fled from repressive Islam). \r\n\r\nFor the scary demographics presented to be relevant, the muslims would all have to be islamists, and they would all have to stay islamists over generations in their new society. It's not happening. And then we haven't even reached the nonsense of all muslims somehow being under the control of \"The Caliphate\".\r\n\r\nWe've spent some hundred years restraining Christianity and making its most backwards and inhuman ideas shunned. We can take on backwards striving muslims as well (and let's not forget the immigrant more fundamentalist reinforcements of Christianity).","link_id":"t3_v8ly","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37940-ebc0fef6-2b3e-4e95-a710-0c96c65d5624-1566236772"}

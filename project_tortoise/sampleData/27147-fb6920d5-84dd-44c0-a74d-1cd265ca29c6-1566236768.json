Maybe even GM crops.  There are many other things like biomass and even garbage that can be used but I think we are looking at it with today's tech.  In 20 years we could have towers of agriculture or levels of fields stacked with plants that are much more improved.  Yes I agree its only a part of the picture and that is why pluggable cars for fuel sources is a good idea.  Let the open market of MANY different fuel sources compete not just one.  People don't think that even 15% of the market woudl change prices?  Also however, your numbers might be slightly off.  Ethanol is CURRENTLY 15% of all fuel year round now tha MTBEs are gone.  That is 15% of Ethanol ALREADY in your tank.  Its already part of the infrastructure.  I wouldn't doubt if most of these studies are embedded PR from oil cartels.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uoxe","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27147-fb6920d5-84dd-44c0-a74d-1cd265ca29c6-1566236768"}

The only significant technology hurdle to building a space elevator is a material with sufficient tensile strength at large scale.\r\n\r\nOnce such a material is available, the economics of the elevator are so superior to any other space access technology that even the enormous political and finanicial logistics of such a project can be readily overcome.\r\n\r\n&gt; Vehicles without any internal guidance or power source...\r\n\r\nWah???  What like most of the trains in europe and japan, or american cities?  Or any ordinary elevator?\r\n\r\nYou're like a chap 120 years ago who could sit on a bench watching birds flit about and tell us how heavier than air flight is impossible. What a strange world you live in where both phasers and rail guns are marvelous fictions.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50668-5fd038ae-50e4-43d6-8207-31053bd0b7b4-1566236778"}

Gay lifestyle will never be accepted in the mainstream, even if religion was suddenly disappeared.  And religion will never receive the credibility it demands even if it were to become the mandate of the State.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because both have happened in history.  And both have failed many times before to gain the mainstream acceptance that they both crave.\r\n\r\nBoth are unnatural (go ahead and bash, I simply don't care) and contradict common sense.  Both seek deviant behavior normalization that has never been fully accepted by society.  \r\n\r\nEven in ancient history, when mankind lived in tribes, a gay lifestyle was taboo.  And so was a forced religion upon other tribes of differning beliefs.  Modern civilization isn't any different.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I find it hilarous that both groups would seek reconciliation (or salvation) from each other, because neither 'matters'.  Why should one require (or demand) acceptance by the other?\r\n\r\nIf such 'validation' is necessary, these groups need to seriously ask themselves why.\r\n\r\nI don't give a shit if you marry a man, or a woman, or what your religious biases, I mean beliefs are.  Just don't demand that I accept it.  Your lifestyle and your beliefs are yours, and they should be kept private for that reason alone.  Nobody's lifestyle should require public flaunting and flagellation.  Whenever this happens, it just turns people off because they expect you to mind your own business, while they mind theirs.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ul96","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808407,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lifeofliberty","edited":false,"id":"cule8","parent_id":"t3_ul96","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25167-0dbada20-3762-437a-b970-ca55cc1e8edf-1566236767"}

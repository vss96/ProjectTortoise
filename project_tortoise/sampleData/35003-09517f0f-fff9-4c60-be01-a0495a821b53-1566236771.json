Granted the logistics would have been a nightmare, but Germany was able to invade both Norway and North Africa, and support armies in those areas with sea-dependent supply lines, so such an operation cannot be considered logistically impossible.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the Royal Navy would have been deployed in the defense of England.  With German air superiority over the channel, the navy would have been completely destroyed rather easily.  Further, as an invading army would have been able to quickly establish control over the airfields in southern England, the Germans would have uncontested air superiority in a short matter of time.  \r\n\r\nAs ignoble as it sounds, I think the government and the navy would likely have evacuated to India or Australia and continued the war from there had England actually faced invasion.  And if the Germans had invaded in the fall of 1940 or the spring of 41, they would have defeated England and likely won the war, IMHO.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166410949,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35003-09517f0f-fff9-4c60-be01-a0495a821b53-1566236771"}

He could have easily asked him other questions, specific about intoxication, to investigate further.  This would have given the officer the opportunity to smell Brett's breath, visually look for signs of impairment.  Instead, the idiot officer that can't even drive a stick detains him.  Brett just didn't want to tell the officer where he was going.  He is well within his rights.  If more people understood and protected their individual rights then police departments might have to start hiring cops with IQs in the triple digit range.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wgpl","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167524545,"score":5,"ups":5,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59332-3d6914d4-a243-47ba-af80-802dfe74b2ca-1566236780"}

I'm pretty much against capitalism, finding it wasteful, destructive and wanton in so many respects that I have little support for it.\r\n\r\nBut I don't consider this view, or the non-profit views of Craigslist even slightly communist, because it isn't. \r\n\r\nSince the State has no right nor business in the affairs of individuals, I fail to understand the \"communist\" comments. But you'd also need to understand that the State is an extension of the capitilistic corporations whose sole reason for existence is profits, to understand what this means.\r\n\r\nI hope Craigslist can continue to hold the line.","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22748-fbb29cc7-a1e7-4d8a-8d4c-78e248277d96-1566236766"}

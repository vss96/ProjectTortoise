You've paid your phone bill, Bob's Pizza has paid their phone bill. The phone company decides that they will wait 5 minutes to connect you because domino's paid them a big wad of cash, if you want pizza now, you have to call dominos. Some people get angry when they pay for a service and it is not delivered.\r\n\r\nWithout nn the internet is no longer a network for connecting people to each other, it will become a simpler push style content delivery system with some minor two way functionality.\r\n\r\nNo more online gaming either, unless it's a flash game on your myspace page.\r\n\r\nThere are strong free market arguments against nn but some people, like me, feel very strongly about not wanting to replace the internet with what is basically television 2.0\r\n\r\nSorry for responding to the NN comment and getting us more off track.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u03j","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1165532838,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14819-3bc6d3d9-3fc3-4536-8248-6d724d33eade-1566236762"}

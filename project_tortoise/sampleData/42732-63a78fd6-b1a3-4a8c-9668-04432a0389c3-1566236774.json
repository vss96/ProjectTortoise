I've seen many MadTV episodes, including today, and they are virtually unwatchable. Almost all the skits basically try to create humor by annoying you. You can see this in Swan lady, in the big child skits, that one woman's extremely annoying stuttering mouth-noise (hard to describe) that has to come up in every episode, etc. I've only seen a handful of skits that were funny, and none have been as funny as the skits were consistently during the classic era of SNL. There is nothing that compares to celebrity jeopardy, or the cowbell skit, with hilarious actors Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Steve Martin, etc.\r\n\r\nI did see a pretty funny MadTV skit recently though. It involved ordering an incredibly complex order from a hamburger joint. It stuck out in my mind because in the entire episode I watched, it was the only thing that caused me to laugh. And I laugh easily.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vk8k","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166682644,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42732-63a78fd6-b1a3-4a8c-9668-04432a0389c3-1566236774"}

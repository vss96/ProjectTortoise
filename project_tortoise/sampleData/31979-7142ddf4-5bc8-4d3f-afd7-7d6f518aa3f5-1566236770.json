Landmines, you know, which are opposed by 1200 groups in 60 countries, forming the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, also an aim of the United Nations?\r\n\r\n&gt; Those are all simple, effective methods to secure the border \r\n\r\nExcept mining hundreds of miles of border isn't exactly simple OR effective.  Or humane.  Proposing maiming and murdering people for crossing an imaginary line to seek jobs doing menial work that supports your infrastructure is beyond the pale.  Another way to solve the outcry would simply be to use laser beams on people who are rabidly anti-immigration.\r\n\r\nI guess some people haven't evolved yet.\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808677,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cuztt","parent_id":"t1_cuzq6","author_flair_text":null,"author":"lemmikins","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31979-7142ddf4-5bc8-4d3f-afd7-7d6f518aa3f5-1566236770"}

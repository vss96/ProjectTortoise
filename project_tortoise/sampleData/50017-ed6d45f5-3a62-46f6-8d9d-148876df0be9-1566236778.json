The database would simply append the MSFT record right after the IBM record and the index would be updated to say \"the MSFT records are here, here and here in many places in the table\"  However in this case he is using partitioned tables, so the MSFT records are in the M table and the IBM quotes are in the I table.  So in this case inserting an M record after an I record probably means there will be a disk seek.  Of course the OS files which hold the I and M tables are themselves broken down into filesystem blocks which may be in the same sector.  Then there might be RAID or LVM which further obfuscates where the data is actually going and makes it more fun predicting \"this will cause a seek.\"","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809368,"gilded":0,"id":"cw015","parent_id":"t1_cvzig","edited":false,"author":"denimboy","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50017-ed6d45f5-3a62-46f6-8d9d-148876df0be9-1566236778"}

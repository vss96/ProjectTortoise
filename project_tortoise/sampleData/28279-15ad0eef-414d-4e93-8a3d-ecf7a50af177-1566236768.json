The only way anyone could offer a loan at below market value is if they're making money some other way than besides the loan. Like, say, an infinite supply of tax money.\r\n\r\nYou believe it is moral for the government to force someone to pay for another person's education, I do not. Back to square one.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out that there are many financial institutions willing to loan money to students at competitive market rates, thereby showing that yes, education would still somehow continue without government involvement (as it has for thousands of years).\r\n\r\nYou simply insist on moving the goalposts every comment you make.\r\n\r\nBTW, it looks to me like even the government is reluctant to lend money at the insane 2% that you quote:\r\n\r\n&gt;As of 12-11-2006, the current projections for the 2007-2008 variable interest rates are:\r\n\r\n    * Stafford Loan (In-School Rate Projection): 6.63%\r\n    * Stafford Loan (Repayment Rate Projection): 7.23%\r\n    * PLUS Loan (Rate Projection): 8.03%\r\n\r\n[Source](http://www.finaid.org/loans/scripts/interest.cgi)\r\n\r\n&gt;And by the way, I'm not sure why you accept no services from the government. After all, you helped pay for them. You so crazy!\r\n\r\nI have principles.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808532,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cus3u","edited":false,"id":"cus7x","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoFixedAbode","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28279-15ad0eef-414d-4e93-8a3d-ecf7a50af177-1566236768"}

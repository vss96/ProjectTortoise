Remember that a dual-layer DVD - the type used by Hollywood - can hold twice as much. \r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no need for a high-format, high-density disc if all you're doing on it is watching -a- movie.  Blueray and HDDVD might be good if you're watching complete series of television shows or multiple movies, but there is no way that Hollywood would allow you to buy one disc at a cost that isn't prohibitively expensive - at least not as a one-shot purchase \r\n\r\nSo, here's the question: Is HDDVD and BlueRay really bringing the products to market that the customers demand, or is it that the content creators have so much control over distribution they'll just shove it down our throats anyway?","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53226-79890cff-0f56-4821-b879-c110cd1a53a6-1566236778"}

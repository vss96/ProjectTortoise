It does not use Hashcash at all.  It simply requires a *single* hash using JavaScript, and it relies on the fact that most spambots don't have a JavaScript engine.  In other words: security through obscurity.\r\n\r\nAs far as using Java: unfortunately, Java is so far the best solution I have been able to come up with.  While it can theoretically be done in JavaScript, my own tests have shown JavaScript to be about 500 times slower than Java for this purpose.  This puts legitimate users at a huge disadvantage to spammers, who can write their own minting engine in C if they choose to.  Java is only about 10 times slower than C, so it's not a huge difference.","link_id":"t3_ujbj","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808569,"distinguished":null,"author":"DavidSJ","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cuob4","edited":false,"id":"cuu5w","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29321-9fb81ba9-90b5-42ca-9343-2b11ed935bcd-1566236769"}

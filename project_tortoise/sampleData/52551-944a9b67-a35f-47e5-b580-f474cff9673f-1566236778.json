Because ads rise to the top *both* for their relevance *and* for how much the advertiser bid for the search terms.\r\n\r\nGoogle can bid a million dollars a click for the term \"blog\" and even note it on their books, but it would still be an internal cost.  Quadruple entry method: debit/credit here, credit/debit there.\r\n\r\nNote that I am not commenting on whether it is right for Google to plug their own services through adwords.  I just think it is a little disingenuous to say they're like everyone else that bids for terms.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w3h0","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52551-944a9b67-a35f-47e5-b580-f474cff9673f-1566236778"}

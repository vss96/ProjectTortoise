Homesite is the worst offender, but I have plenty of programs that ask me to save files in dumbass places, like in the root level of my C: drive. And the worst part is that it's inconsistent.\r\n\r\nAnother annoying thing about the dual monitors is that if I unplug one of them, or hook up a new one, Windows doesn't notice until I restart. My MacBook sees the new monitor immediately. Hell, the PowerBook I owned in 2000, saw it immediately, and that was on OS 9, so it's not like something new to Tiger.\r\n\r\nI get constant virtual memory warnings. It's ridiculous. This PC is less than a year old. Going to a gig of ram certainly helped, but it only delays the inevitable warnings. Not that I need the warnings to tell me that my computer has become slow as molasses.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23485-8547583b-ce10-4797-a8d0-fe2ccf98aff6-1566236766"}

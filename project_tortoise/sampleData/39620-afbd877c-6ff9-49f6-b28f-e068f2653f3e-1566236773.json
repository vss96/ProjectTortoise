And you know, I'm glad they're against the law, cuz you know what happened when I took them? I laid in a field of green grass for 4 hours going MY GOOOOOD... I LOVE EVERYTHING. the heavens parted and god rained down gifts of forgiveness, healing me on every level, physically, psychically, emotionally... And im glad they are against the law. How are we gonna keep building nuclear weapons, you know what i mean?

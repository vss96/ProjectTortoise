A subliminal media fight and a covert legal dispute escalated into an online showdown with the heist of over 3000 books at the center of the story. Lizvlx from UBERMORGEN.COM had daily shoot outs with the global massmedia, Cirio continuously pushed the boundaries of copyright (books are just pixels on a screen or just ink on paper), Ludovico and Bernhard resisted kickback-bribes from powerful Amazon.com until they finally gave in and sold the technology for an undisclosed sum to Amazon. Betrayal, blasphemy and pessimism finally split the gang of bad guys. The good guys (Amazon.com) won the showdown and drove off into the blistering sun with the beautiful femme fatale, the seductive and erotic massmedia.","retrieved_on":1473808698,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cv0zz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v0zw","author":"hansbernhard","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32426-5b6ec824-5b4c-41aa-bb10-203c5c12484f-1566236770"}

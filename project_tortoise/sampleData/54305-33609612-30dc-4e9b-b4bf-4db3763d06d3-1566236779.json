It's heartbreaking to see how there has been some backsliding (worldwide) on democratic reforms in the decade and a half since the USSR broke up, but important to know that there are movements towards more democratic rule in parts of the world that have historically been very troubled.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our media is biased towards sensationalism - that which shocks and amazes the viewer - and the humanistic perspective is lost.  We often only see the worst, most alien, the most extreme from other cultures and rarely the best and most similar.  This is not, of course, to claim a relativistic worldview, but to note that there has been a great deal of progress that may not be acknowledged by the developed world.  Rest assured that there are those who pay close attention to such things, and that we support your efforts and those of your countrymen.\r\n\r\nI'm no neoconservative (neoliberal) but certainly hope that in the future there will be more successes of this kind.  The right to be ruled by a government of one's choosing is absolutely a fundamental human right.  Wishing you and yours the best.","link_id":"t3_w79t","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54305-33609612-30dc-4e9b-b4bf-4db3763d06d3-1566236779"}

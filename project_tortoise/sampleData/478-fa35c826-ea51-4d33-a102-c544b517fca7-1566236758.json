We look back on people a 100 years ago and think they just didn't have a clue.\r\n\r\nThe mindset 100 years ago was very different than it has been since WWII.  The invention of the atom bomb, man's going to space and landing on the moon, and other remarkable achievements sparked peoples' imaginations.  Look at how popular sci-fi was back in the 50s, for example.\r\n\r\nThe tendency 100 years ago was to discount new inventions.  The tendency 50 years ago, and it continues to this day, is to make wildly inaccurate and hopelessly optimistic predictions.\r\n\r\nHere's a quote for you.  Marvin Minsky:\r\n\r\n&gt;In from three to eight years, we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.  I mean a machine that will be able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, have a fight.  At that point, the machine will begin to educate itself with fantastic speed.  In a few months, it will be at genius level, and a few months after that, its power will be incalculable.\r\n\r\nThat's from 1970.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t345","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","created_utc":1164944903,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"478-fa35c826-ea51-4d33-a102-c544b517fca7-1566236758"}

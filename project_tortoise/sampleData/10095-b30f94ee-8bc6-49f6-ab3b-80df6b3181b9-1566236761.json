It's good to see an economic article on Reddit that isn't just some guys blog.\r\n\r\nThe weird thing about the article is the lack of mention how asian growth, particularly Chinese but also for the rest of Asia, is mentioned. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know how fast European exports to China are growing.

There's a big difference between telling someone to not look left and right, and shoving them in the street. You can argue for assisted suicide if you want, but the difference is that assisted suicide puts responsibility on both parties, while murder puts responsibility on only a single party.\r\n\r\ni think i'm arguing here for a relativist morality, where the actions of the Church can only be judged from within that morality, so i'll stop. perhaps there is one morality from which to judge the Church; i'd argue however that it's probably not mine, and it's probably not yours. i do think that there is a failure to try and look at the opposing point of view, and that to put the blame solely on the Church is silly.\r\n\r\nWhere does the responsibility of the Church end and where does personal responsibility begin? Whose concept of morality should the Church's actions be judged with?\r\n\r\nSimply put, the Church believed (believes?) that mankind shouldn't interfere or second-guess the will of God. If God wills something to be, it doesn't matter how horrible you *think* that it is, because if that's what God wills, then that's what should happen. The Church believed that contraception was against the will of God, but this belief was grounded in a time without the knowledge if STDs, and where sex wasn't casual. I'm just asking to please look outside your own frame of reference.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166293380,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32594-42b12d79-b5a4-420f-95ab-01b77c2f5b22-1566236770"}

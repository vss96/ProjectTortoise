We just let the sheiks run the show? They could join the police force and run the country, and blend in so well in plain clothes that the insurgents would leave. Sure, there might be corruption, and several deaths annually, but it would be far more peaceful than anything we could pull off against the insurgents. As well, I think we should scale our whole operation back because there's no way to win in a civil war where you can't pick a side to stand behind.\r\n\r\nAnd then we just sit back and use the CIA to manage the thing.

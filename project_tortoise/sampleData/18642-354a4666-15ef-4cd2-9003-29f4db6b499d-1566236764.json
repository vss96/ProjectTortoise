Some of them were to get high and party. Now, I'm not proud of the things I did to fry my brain, but there are some experiences that really stick out in my mind as some of my most memorable, insightful, life changing experiences. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, my first dose of MDMA changed the way I percieve life the way finding Christ might, and I think I'd be a totally different person today had I never had any. I do believe that there are lots of sad, lonely confused people out there who could benefit from just one night on MDMA.","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_u73f","stickied":false,"subreddit":"science","ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165685128,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18642-354a4666-15ef-4cd2-9003-29f4db6b499d-1566236764"}

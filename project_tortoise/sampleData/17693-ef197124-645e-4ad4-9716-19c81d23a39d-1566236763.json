Get your stupid libertarian head out of your ass and do something crazy like learn how economies work. One of the reasons that governments tax people is so that they can do certain things that a nation should have done, but can't be accomplished within the private sector. The cost of, say, developing nuclear fucking fission was enormous, and if we had left it up to the private sector, it probably still wouldn't be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances when governments spend that money on things that a country really shouldn't have (like the Iraq War) but there are still many, many examples of thoughtful government spending. Roads, highways, electric grids, other utilities, national defense, and yes, going the goddamn moon.","ups":-3,"score":-3,"created_utc":1165631744,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"science","id":"cu74q","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu6tq","author_flair_text":null,"author":"mangleon","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808139,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17693-ef197124-645e-4ad4-9716-19c81d23a39d-1566236763"}

This is an emerging lighting technology that we will be seeing a whole lot more of. Right now you either have to buy them packaged in a lighting fixture or the ones available to replace regular bulbs are usually pretty dim bulbs, about like a 10 watt but use only 2 or 3 watts. Mostly this type of bulb is not dimable, in fact reduced voltage will harm the LED modules and drasticly reduce their long life(50,000 hours or more). If you want to try some LED light bulbs at a good price www.shop.donsgreenstore.com doesn't seem to charge nearly as much as most places. But don't expect too much light from these dim bulbs. But they do work great as a night light or small reading lamp. IF they last 50,000 hours or more and only use 2 or 3 Watts of electricity that's fantastic.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166882212,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvucy","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_5ct5","author":"Calgreen","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809261,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47221-d4e36e47-77f7-4e75-8e3f-18da2e564f91-1566236775"}

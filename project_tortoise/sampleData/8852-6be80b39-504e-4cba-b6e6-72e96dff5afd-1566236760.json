More study subjects do not automatically make a study more valid. It's been over a decade since I did any science or statistics, but from what I recall,  if confounding variables are controlled, and the subjects are selected appropriately, a study can be valid (i.e. it's results can be said to be scientific knowledge.)\r\n\r\nIn your example, you're attempting to compare polling to a scientific study. They're two very different ways of obtaining information about reality, with their own ways of using statistics to sort the signal from the noise and control confounding variables.\r\n\r\nWhat's more - generally the onus of proof is on he who asserts the positive. Since the government line for decades has been 'gateway drug', I'd like to know if they actually have any decent studies showing that, or if they're just making it up like most of the rest of their support for the drug war.","link_id":"t3_tllx","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8852-6be80b39-504e-4cba-b6e6-72e96dff5afd-1566236760"}

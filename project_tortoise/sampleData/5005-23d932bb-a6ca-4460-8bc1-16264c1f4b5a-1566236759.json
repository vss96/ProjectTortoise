Pop music has been around for a long time and it's always been packaged. And ffs to complain about computers and music in 2006 - it's like electronic music never existed or there was no distinction between the good and bad stuff. What next - a campaign against digital reverb because it's not the real thing?

If you don't want to hear sequencing or autotune, go and support you local lesbian punk outfit - or if that's not your thing there's jazz or folk (though I reckon excessive autotune makes everything sound like folk) or classical music etc.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807636,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctgb5","parent_id":"t3_tenx","author_flair_text":null,"author":"chu","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5005-23d932bb-a6ca-4460-8bc1-16264c1f4b5a-1566236759"}

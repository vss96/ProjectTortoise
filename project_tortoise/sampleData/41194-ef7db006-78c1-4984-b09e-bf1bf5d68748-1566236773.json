A five point swing on an IQ test isn't much to draw conclusions from.  (It's about a third of a standard deviation.)\r\n2. The participants' vegetarianism was self reported, so any real conclusions based on their diets are impossible.\r\n3. The participants' IQs weren't tested in the present day, only back when they were 10.  At least, it wasn't reported.  This makes the researcher's insinuations that diet somehow affected their intelligence total B.S.\r\n4. Traditional IQ tests, like the sort that were used 20 years ago, have a well documented correlation with [demographic differences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Group_differences).  Could vegetarianism and demographics have a similar correlation?\r\n\r\nIt would be intersting to see what a properly designed study on diet and intelligence would show.","created_utc":1166634943,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"science","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41194-ef7db006-78c1-4984-b09e-bf1bf5d68748-1566236773"}

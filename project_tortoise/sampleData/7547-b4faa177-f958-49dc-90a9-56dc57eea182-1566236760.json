I think his guess for the \"5 products people can remember\" is a good one.\r\n\r\nHowever, \"features not products\" is a perilous road for Google to go down. It's been said that a product's design reflects the organization that built it, and the reverse is true as well. Will Google be able to recruit the same level of talent without the promise of small teams producing great new products?\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is set up with a few business organizations producing a small number of big products (Office, Windows, Exchange) by way of thousands of \"feature teams\". It takes a lot of Kool-Aid to be convinced that even the greatest feature is as rewarding to ship as a whole new product. I'd hate to see Google forced down this road. How do you make feature development as exciting as product development?","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7547-b4faa177-f958-49dc-90a9-56dc57eea182-1566236760"}

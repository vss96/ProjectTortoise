There's no monopoly. There's no exam.\r\n\r\n- Accreditation is handled privately, probably by prominent doctor's groups, since they're trading on reputation. Accreditation is not mandatory to practise, and no doctor's organization has any special status in law.\r\n\r\n- The state only involves itself in competence through lemon laws, fraud laws, negligence lawsuits and the similar.\r\n\r\n- There are no such thing as prescription drugs or illegal drugs. All drugs are over-the-counter.\r\n\r\n- There are no drug patents, and there are no gene patents.\r\n\r\n- Neither are there hugely expensive drug testing requirements. If you want to try an untested drug, it's your funeral.\r\n\r\n- Anyone can charge what they please for doctoring.","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165180164,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5373-ebc96bcf-7610-4dfb-a072-df422fa20c97-1566236759"}

No one was singling him out. No one decided 'lets screw those f***'ers with 2 letter last  names'. It was a dumb mistake by the programmers who made a bad assumption. The suggestion to change his last name probably was more like 'enter something with three letters' as a workaround.\r\n\r\nThe link title is misleading. The company's solution was to fix the software and give him a gift card.\r\n\r\nThe only real complaint is the difficulty to get to the proper level of accountability in the company to get the problem fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_waw9","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56035-b5f26810-3799-439e-8e95-2b7f5ff86f82-1566236779"}

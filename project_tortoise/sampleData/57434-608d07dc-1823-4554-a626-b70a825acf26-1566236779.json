{"controversiality":0,"body":"That seems to be a dubious claim at best. From Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n'There have been a number of false reports that Jews are banned from entering Dubai. Der Spiegel writes that \"all Jews are strictly banned from entering the country\",[14] while other sources state that only Israeli citizens, including Muslims, have their visas routinely denied. Rejection of visa applications for Jews of non-Israeli citizenship is \"expat urban legend.\"[15]. The official line reported by local newspapers is that the Dubai government is anti-Zionist, not anti-Semitic, meaning that it does not support the actions of the Israeli government, but at the same time, it does not discriminate against Jews. This has been supported repeatedly by several posts on Dubai-based internet forums from Jewish residents of the city, which confirm that there are expat Jews living in Dubai and also visiting for purposes of business or tourism.'","link_id":"t3_wcfe","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167424411,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"procrastitron","id":"cwe53","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwdym","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809635,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57434-608d07dc-1823-4554-a626-b70a825acf26-1566236779"}

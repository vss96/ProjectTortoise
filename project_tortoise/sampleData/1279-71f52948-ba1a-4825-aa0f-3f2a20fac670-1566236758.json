Every currency quote actually has two components to it; a sell quote, and a buy quote.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you want to \"buy\" USD its a different price than \"selling\" USD. For example the USD/EUR quote may be 1.33 1.31 (meaning if you buy 1 EUR it will cost you $1.33 USD, likewise if you sell 1 EUR you will get $1.31 USD)\r\n\r\nThe effect of this spread is that if you continually cycle USD-EUR-USD-EUR-USD..etc, the 'cost' of this spread will eventually cause you to lose significant amounts of money.\r\n\r\nWhich is why anyone involved in the oil trade will hold reserves in USD base currency.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t4dt","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807489,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"econo","parent_id":"t1_ct7no","edited":false,"id":"ct8h2","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1279-71f52948-ba1a-4825-aa0f-3f2a20fac670-1566236758"}

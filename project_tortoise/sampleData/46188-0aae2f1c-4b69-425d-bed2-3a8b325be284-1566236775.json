{"controversiality":0,"body":"objective-c was also my first c-family language. I guess making the jump to C will be less painfull after some objective-c knowledge, but they are very different animals. if you dive into objective-c without knowing any C, every now and then you will run into something you don't understand (specially reading other's code) but soon enough you will get the hang of it.\r\n\r\nobjective-c is beautifull, very rich runtime information, lots to learn. also, the message passing sintax is great, even better than python's named parameters (which are great too), and I miss it in every other language I've used. \r\n\r\nI often wonder why there's so litlle interest in this language, but I guess it has to do mosttly with implementation issues (specially on the open-source side).\r\n\r\nfor those using a mac, apple's cocoa bundles a great ide, good libraries, the best gui programming environment I've seen.\r\n\r\nsure dive right in. I am not sure objective-c will make you want to learn c, but will probably give you some insights into other programming languages .\r\n\r\nnext on the list: smalltalk","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_vs9v","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":11,"ups":11,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166822141,"author":"tucadebert","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvsaq","edited":false,"id":"cvsbz","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809222,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46188-0aae2f1c-4b69-425d-bed2-3a8b325be284-1566236775"}

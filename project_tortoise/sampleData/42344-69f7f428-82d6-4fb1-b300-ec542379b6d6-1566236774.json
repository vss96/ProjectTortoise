If one loses the sexual potential of one's teenage years, one can never really undo the loss.  One doesn't just lose x% of the possible orgasms of one's life.  One loses the _best_ ones, the ones which neither need viagra nor are compromised by all the ills of later life.  Chaste is not a minor waste.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vh1r","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809076,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"soreff","parent_id":"t1_cvivt","id":"cvkps","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42344-69f7f428-82d6-4fb1-b300-ec542379b6d6-1566236774"}

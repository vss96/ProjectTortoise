This quote really sums up my personal view on the subject as well:\r\n\r\n&gt; From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been an atheist.... I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a childlike one. You may call me an agnostic, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our being.\r\n\r\nThe foibles of atheists are the same as those of feminists.","controversiality":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165238148,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctjq0","parent_id":"t1_ctj9h","author_flair_text":null,"author":"acrophobia","retrieved_on":1473807701,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6470-df3ca42c-7e01-4ad7-ab25-b5b1df952a67-1566236760"}

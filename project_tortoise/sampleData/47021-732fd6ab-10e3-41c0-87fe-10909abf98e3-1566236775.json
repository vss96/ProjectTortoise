When the legal process of getting married was developed in each state the framers of the laws did not intend \"marriage\" to include the union of two men or two women. therefore these couples can not legally become married.  I am not saying however that they are not entitled to their own form of marriage and it should be legally sanctioned.\r\n\r\nBiologically and religiously however i do not believe that homosexuality is good for human evolution or society.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vr00","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809250,"author":"madknight","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvtte","parent_id":"t3_vr00","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47021-732fd6ab-10e3-41c0-87fe-10909abf98e3-1566236775"}

The story here boils down to:\r\n\r\n&gt; A total of 47 percent of westerners haven't bothered to make the trip east [...] Younger people in particular seem uninterested in the region, while 64 percent of westerners aged 50 to 64 have ventured east. [...] By contrast only 12 percent of easterners haven't visited the former West Germany.\r\n\r\nI.e. young western Germans in particular don't give a shit\r\n\r\nWhy? Perhaps you answered it...\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there anything really new or different in the east of the same country? Maybe if you have a darker skin tone. It's more likely to get beaten up in the east ...\r\n\r\nI'd suggest that's exactly the kind of ignorance and predjudice that keeps younger westerners at home.\r\n\r\nBack in 1989, on re-unification, East Germany was like a time capsule - \"financially frozen\" in time for more than 50 years (perhaps even pre-first world war in some places). Many parts (outside of the cities) still are.\r\n\r\nIf you don't find that, in itself, interesting (and there's a whole lot more interesting history, such as 45 years of communism) and worth visiting, perhaps Disneyland Paris would be a better destination.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_waa8","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809585,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"harryf","id":"cwbib","parent_id":"t1_cwac4","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56129-b9de5d7b-1a71-42c0-b838-c9c4e028b7eb-1566236779"}

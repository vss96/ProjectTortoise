It's simply that people won't even get those.\r\n\r\nThe convenience of heat-and-eat meals and other easy to prepare foods like frozen pizza, chicken fingers, fries, hot dogs, burgers, and the other junk food they talk about is just too tempting for a lot of people most of the time. Making even an easy stir-fry or pasta or soup is often too much work to bother with, with all the different ingredients and putting it all together. I'm not saying I agree, but people seem to feel they're too busy to cook nowadays, so they don't.\r\n\r\nFresh and organic are definitely important, in my opinion, but the first focus should be getting people to eat vegetables in the first place, and for that convenience (and thus canned, semi-prepared stuff) is probably a lot more important right now.","created_utc":1165357881,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctqyu","id":"ctrao","author_flair_text":null,"author":"cecilkorik","retrieved_on":1473807842,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10061-1bed334d-2e11-497f-b757-049a22d7f713-1566236761"}

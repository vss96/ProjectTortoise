This is a video that takes some of the strangest stuff ever said by mormon leaders and presents it as official/important church doctrine.  While most of the stuff in the video isn't anywhere near \"official\" church doctrine, it's important to emphasize that almost *nothing* in the video is important church doctrine (or if it's false, isn't even a lie about an important doctrine).  Even if you find references for people actually saying it, that in no way implies that the church teaches it.  For instance, early church (and I mean Catholic Church, here) fathers postulated at least half of the weird stuff in that video (Jesus was married, God is married, God is Adam, men literally become Gods like Jesus), but no Catholics learn that, because it's not what the Catholic church emphasizes.  When you take unimportant doctrines and make them really important, you get the laughable religious history, like the persecution of Galileo, Mountain Meadows, or this video.  If you take the important doctrines and live them as fully as possible, you get the really cool religious influences like Salvation Army, Red Cross, Mother Theresa, abolition, inalienable rights, etc.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ud3o","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22559-8dee449d-7f2d-4059-99dc-28fde8a827c6-1566236766"}

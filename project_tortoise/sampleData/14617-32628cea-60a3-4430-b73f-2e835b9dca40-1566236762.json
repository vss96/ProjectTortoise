Or, if it is infinity, it's also negative infinity. Graph 1/x. You'll notice that from -1 to 0 it dips down to negative infinity, and from 1 to 0 it goes up, to positive infinity. So, 1/0 is probably either infinity, negative infinite or an average of the two (zero?). However, if you try setting 1/0 to anything you end up with absurdities where 1 = 0 and whatnot. Ex:\r\n\r\n    5a = 0\r\n    5a - a = -a\r\n    4a = -a\r\n    4a/a = -a/a  ← I'm dividing by zero here. Don't do this!\r\n    4 = -1\r\n\r\n**Edit**: made it more clear why 4 ≠ -1.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tzna","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14617-32628cea-60a3-4430-b73f-2e835b9dca40-1566236762"}

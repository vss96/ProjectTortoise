And don't forget Nixon.\r\n\r\nMy condolences to his wife and family.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Read the NYT obit and there was a lot more to the man than I knew when I was just a young, ignorant teenager who watched the whole Nixon debacle first hand. Ford wasn't well liked in his term from what I recall and after Nixon I wasn't about to trust any politician. So with that I'll let things pass. Rest in peace, Mr. Ford. You deserve it.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w48y","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167228214,"author":"artman","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cw59y","parent_id":"t3_w48y","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809467,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52871-571e93df-ab9d-4ab1-ba95-cfe627cd5d2a-1566236778"}

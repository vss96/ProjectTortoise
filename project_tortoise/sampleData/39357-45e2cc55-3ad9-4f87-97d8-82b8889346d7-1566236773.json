{"body":"America needs some really radical, hard-line legislation to stop this. Here's a draft; what do the rest of you think?\r\n\r\n1. In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\r\n\r\n2. Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\r\n\r\nThis is probably so soft on terrorists that nobody will vote for it, but it's a good start.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vcii","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166563738,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":12,"ups":12,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"sketerpot","edited":false,"id":"cvevj","parent_id":"t3_vcii","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808962,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39357-45e2cc55-3ad9-4f87-97d8-82b8889346d7-1566236773"}

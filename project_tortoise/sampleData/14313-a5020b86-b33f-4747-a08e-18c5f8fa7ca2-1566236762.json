One could argue about whether NaN always does the right thing. The Wikipedia page has some examples of its weird behavior, such as NaN &lt;= Infinity evaluating to false, but my short search for the standard only turned up broken links, so I can't source that more reliably.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tzna","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165518087,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14313-a5020b86-b33f-4747-a08e-18c5f8fa7ca2-1566236762"}

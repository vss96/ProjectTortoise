{"body":"Agreed. The focus of Krugman's article doesn't seem to be wealth creation, so Paul Graham's article doesn't seem to really address the same issue, or respond to Krugman's points.  \r\n\r\nKrugman's questions seems to be: is entrenched political and economic power being used unjustly to benefit those who are already wealthy? \r\n\r\nIt's undeniable that political corruption and back scratching are the mainstays of old-money in many countries, but are they being imported into a society that is world-renowned for being based on meritocracy?  Is it being imported into the US?\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_unoz","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166044332,"score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"neuquino","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuowe","id":"cup10","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808474,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26861-95bea8dd-1a52-4a52-bcdb-696d70ec3c66-1566236768"}

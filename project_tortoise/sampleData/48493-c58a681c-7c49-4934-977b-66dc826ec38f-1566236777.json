If we look at the entire summary, we can see that of the two options, travelling near the median speed is better than going slower. I mean, here's the first paragraph of the Summary section, verbatim:\r\n\r\n&gt; There is evidence **that crash risk is lowest near the average speed of traffic** and **increases** for vehicles traveling much **faster or slower** than average. The occurrence of a large number of crashes involving turning maneuver partly explains the **increased risk** for motorists traveling **slower** than average and confirms the importance of safety programs involving turn lanes, access control, grade separation, and other measures to reduce conflicts resulting from large differences in travel speeds.\r\n\r\nI can't see how you could read that any other way, willfully or otherwise.","retrieved_on":1473809310,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvwyr","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvwhw","author_flair_text":null,"author":"raldi","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48493-c58a681c-7c49-4934-977b-66dc826ec38f-1566236777"}

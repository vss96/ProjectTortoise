However, if you voluntarily sell that song to someone, and they copy it, and give me a copy, that copy is mine.  Now, it may be that you have some contract with the person to whom you sold it, whereby they agree they won't copy it, or won't distribute copies.  Such a contract would mean that they were liable for whatever penalties they'd agreed to, of course.  It  has nothing to do with me.\r\n\r\n\"But it's stolen property!\", I hear you cry.  Nope.  Unless you chose to destroy your original, you *still have* your property.  (For clarity, imagine the same situation with a dining room set; as soon as the police discover that you still have yours, they'd ignore you, no matter how closely your neighbor's dining room set matched yours).  What the \"sharing is theft\" folks really want to do is assert their property rights in our hard drives and minds.  To this end, they no longer even attempt to get a contract with someone not to reproduce or copy, prefering to rest their entire case on their weak analogy between stealing and sharing.\r\n\r\nNow, various jurisdictions to make it illegal to share, and I'm not saying that they don't.  I'm just saying that sharing isn't *really* theft, even if there are laws on the books saying it is.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vtf3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809262,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"randallsquared","edited":false,"id":"cvuhp","parent_id":"t1_cvuat","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47281-bba18480-4892-481c-a654-f016338fadcb-1566236775"}

Of course the new consoles will sell better, there's a lot of demand for them. An interesting comparison would be against the launch sales for the XBox 360.\r\n\r\nExcept that too wouldn't tell us anything useful, because the main limiting factor on the launch sales is the rate of manufacturing, not customer interest in the console.\r\n\r\nSo what we really want is sales over the first 6 months/year or so, but we don't have that, so people are wildly predicting from random statistics and hoping no-one notices.\r\n\r\n&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165144365,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4801-184bb8ab-e92b-41ce-be5c-e0f00d5e4e26-1566236759"}

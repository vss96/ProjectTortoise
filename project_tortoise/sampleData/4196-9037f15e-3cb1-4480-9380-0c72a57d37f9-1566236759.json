I've personally communicated with activists who've consistently given far more of themselves socially than Gates and Buffett, week after week. Like Noam Chomsky -- and I'm not namedropping, as anyone can email him; he's just the most famous. Effective activists like them do tireless work for their societies (whose elites viscerally hate them) and even serve jail time.\r\n\r\nSo maybe all Albert Einstein did was revolutionize science; he didn't accumulate megawealth because he [said things like](http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm), *\"This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism.\"* (Not the best attitude for making billions.) Shouldn't the press at least laud his activism nevertheless? ;)\r\n\r\nI have no idea whether Gates' money-dropping is particularly useful; it requires research. (How much of it just goes to biotech firms' profits, for example?) To the extent that his dad explains that his son's wealth [comes from federal spending](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/template.cfm?PubID=900584), and that his buddy Buffett literally explains they're [winning class warfare](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/business/yourmoney/26every.html?ex=1322197200&amp;en=0cf877b05b918674&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss), great.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that Microsoft is a [notorious tax miser](http://www.ctj.org/html/corp0402.htm) (kicking out the ladder form beneath him), and [allegedly promotes plans](http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0439/040929_news_microsoft.php) to get the poor to regressively fund his favored educational programs... This isn't clear-cut.\r\n","ups":-5,"score":-5,"created_utc":1165109658,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4196-9037f15e-3cb1-4480-9380-0c72a57d37f9-1566236759"}

You just call them up, tell them what happened, and ask them to subrogate a claim. They cover your damages, then they sue the living shit out of the responsible party, which is apparently something any first-tier insurance agent can do by pushing a little red button on his desk.\r\n\r\nIt took me 3 months of drama to discover this, and when I did, it was like magic.

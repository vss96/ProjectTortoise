Maybe the dumbass tech thought he needed to install the whole software suite - complete with its own network browser, instead of using the built in windows xp \"wireless zero confi\" or whatever its called. I find it hard to believe that a DRIVER would have these sorts of limitations. The software needing admin rights is more in line with reality. I have never seen a device driver that after its installed, refuses to operate based on the security level of the user of the machine. Its just rediculous and I highly doubt that this one anecdotal case was even scientifically documented. \r\n\r\nD-link tech support is populated by the most clueless people in the world and I am sure this is a combination of a clueless tech in the field and a clueless customer support person out dumbing eachother.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vnjj","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44485-decc458e-41b7-44b5-931f-f3b82d52a185-1566236774"}

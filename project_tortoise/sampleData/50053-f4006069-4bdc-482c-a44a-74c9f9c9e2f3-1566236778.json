{"body":"At home, I'll drink flavored seltzer water (lemon-lime, raspberry, orange, etc.) with that sort of food.  It is literally just carbonated water with (natural) flavoring, so it's nutritionally non-existent: zero sugar, zero salt, zero food dyes, etc. all down the label.  Most grocery stores carry some sort of generic/store-branded flavored seltzer water.  \r\n\r\nThe downside is that it tastes bitter compared to the equivalent flavored soda like Sprite, so if you have a sweet tooth it takes quite a while to get used to it.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vzha","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167078870,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"SpaceCat85","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw03k","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw00u","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809369,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50053-f4006069-4bdc-482c-a44a-74c9f9c9e2f3-1566236778"}

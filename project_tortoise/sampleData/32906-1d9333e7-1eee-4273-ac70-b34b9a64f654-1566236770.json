The question is 'Who would be interested in killing them?' It does not appear that killing them is in Russia's interests, for Russia's been doing pretty well lately, both politically and economically. Why change the course when things are going well?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, current U.S. administration is struggling both politically (Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, North Korea, recent elections) and economically (collapsing dollar + reports that China will convert its huge dollar reserves to other currencies, precious metals, etc). So, some distraction from the current U.S. failures seems to be desirable. Have you noticed how much coverage this case is getting in US \"mainstream\" media?\r\n\r\nOf course I could be wrong. However, when you prepare your income tax check this year, please remember that there are two 'L's in Halliburton.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166309015,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cv23y","parent_id":"t1_cv1zu","author":"centero","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808719,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32906-1d9333e7-1eee-4273-ac70-b34b9a64f654-1566236770"}

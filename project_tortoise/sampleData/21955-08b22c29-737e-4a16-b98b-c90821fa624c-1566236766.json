Look at anything online and there's typos, but not a few per 10,000 words it's a few per paragraph. I like writing on paper because it is slow, I write closer to my ability to create so I don't get distracted.\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend and I are trying to retire the computer for communication, talking on the phone is easier and there's less misunderstandings. It's also a good excuse to get away from the computer for half an hour or so.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165831516,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cueyx","parent_id":"t1_cudqc","author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808285,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21955-08b22c29-737e-4a16-b98b-c90821fa624c-1566236766"}

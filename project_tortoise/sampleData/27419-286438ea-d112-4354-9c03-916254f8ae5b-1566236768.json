I'm not certain.  When I first followed the entry link, it was several hours old already... but when I did find it, I followed it in Opera; I am currently running PCLinuxOS p93, and Opera is the browser I prefer because I am addicted to the feature of being able to close the browser entirely and then resume at a later time with exactly the same configuration - the same tabs linked to the same webpages are restored in the same order and page positions upon later re-opening of the browser, and I enjoy having and using a browser capable of that sort of behaviour.\r\n\r\nAnyhow; the point is, at that time I was viewing the picture as only the first 49% of the file content... in other words, nothing but almost the upper half; it extended from the top of the page to a point immediately below her right nipple - and the remainder of the image was black, to the bottom.  I then followed further links, and attempted to download a high-resolution file.  This download also kept failing at 49% - but; after eight or nine retries, it finally struggled through intact.\r\n\r\nI opened the image in Kuickshow and restored the view to the actual file resolution of 1200 x 1600, where I was able to discern a great amount of fine detail on a high-quality Panasonic PanaSync/Pro PL70i shadowmasked-CRT 17\" monitor driven at 1600 x 1200 x 24-bit colour resolution, at a 75Hz rate of vertical refresh.  I am able to see upon it clear and distinct pixels, as the focus of this particular unit is very sharp and the individual video channels have a wide bandwith of 205MHz.\r\n\r\nI found the picture amusing, and decided to post a comment - the result of this action amazes me.  Usually, my comment entries are not rated very highly but when I retired to bed, the number of upvotes was 12 and I thought that was unusual.  Upon awaking in the morning, I found the count had rose to 63!  Then Reddit crashed... I could no longer update the page.\r\n\r\nReturning home from work this evening, I see the count is now 81 - and that seems a bit odd to me somehow... it's a strange feeling.\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808496,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuoda","id":"cuq71","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27419-286438ea-d112-4354-9c03-916254f8ae5b-1566236768"}

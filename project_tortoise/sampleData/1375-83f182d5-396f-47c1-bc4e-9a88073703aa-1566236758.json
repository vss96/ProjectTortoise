We have no true imperative tense, so we imitate it using the future tense and statements of desire.\r\n\r\nThat, to me, is a point about the way English works, and the understanding you expressed there is faulty.  _You're_ the one who got grammatical.  You tried to blame the command/request confusion on a defect in English, which is most certainly not to blame.  So, I amended your assertion that there is no imperative form in English, thus invalidating your assertion.  Is this really so hard to understand? \r\n\r\nAlso, coldwarrior's point is that the cop is being deceitful by intentionally using a non-imperative form, so that it's not technically a \"command\", but still intimidating the person into thinking that it is.  The problem is that the _cop_ is splitting hairs, not me.\r\n\r\nEdit - clarification","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_sx1y","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1164989852,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1375-83f182d5-396f-47c1-bc4e-9a88073703aa-1566236758"}

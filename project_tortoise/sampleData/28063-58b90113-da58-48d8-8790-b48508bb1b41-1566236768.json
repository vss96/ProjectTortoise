Does anyone ever talk about their \"Japanese Only\" signs ALL OVER the place? Noone ever complains.\r\nBut the sinner is here now, and obviously, it's religion that kills. It's religion that is bad, it's religion that makes people go crazy and drop bombs on innocent people, and it's religion that discriminates against other people. Didn't you know that, according to Islamic law, EVERY PERSON WHO BELIEVES IN ONLY ONE GOD *is a muslim*? \r\n\r\nWhat does that mean to you? It means that yes, every Christian is a muslim. It means that every Jew is a muslim. It means that many people could enter Mekka if it was only about this sign, but it isn't, and here we get to Saudi Arabia's probably misinterpreted laws. But whatever the case is- \"guns don't kill people\". And religion doesn't, either, so stop blaming it for everything. It's the one who has the finger on the trigger, and sometimes it's important to consider whether the motives are simply false pretenses.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28063-58b90113-da58-48d8-8790-b48508bb1b41-1566236768"}

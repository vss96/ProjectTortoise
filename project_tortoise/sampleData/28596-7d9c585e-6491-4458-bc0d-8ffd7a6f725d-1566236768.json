{"controversiality":0,"body":"Actually, if you tried to reproduce this in CL, you'd find yourself cooking up an ad-hoc reimplementation of CamlP4. That's because CamlP4 is much more than a macro system; it also lets you define entirely new forms of quotation, and to support that it also has a full parsing engine. In particular, look at slide 50, where you'll see quasi-quoted C code embedded in Ocaml. \r\n\r\nThere's no particularly easy way to do this in CL. Now, unlike most languages, it is still possible in CL -- I think you'd hook in through the reader macro interface. But you'd basically be throwing away the built in Lisp reader and replacing it with something more flexible, modular and extensible.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_ursb","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":11,"ups":11,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166124351,"author":"neelk","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cusus","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cus7r","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808545,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28596-7d9c585e-6491-4458-bc0d-8ffd7a6f725d-1566236768"}

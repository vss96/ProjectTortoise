Combat Evolved != no cover. Halo combined the gameplay of the original quake with the graphics of Bungie -- 5 years AFTER it was supposed to originally ship for the Mac (but got bought out by MS, ported to xbox, etc). \r\n\r\nHave you even played Halo 2 on Xbox live?\r\n\r\nGears of War is what Halo should've been. Gears of War allows for actual things like 'tactics' and 'force multipliers'. Just like Battlefields 1 and 2 and Call of Duty. \r\n\r\nThe whole run screaming at your enemy to club them to death when you've got a perfectly good machine gun in your arms is what made the game weak. Its for meatheads.","retrieved_on":1473809534,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw7np","id":"cw8ry","author_flair_text":null,"author":"redrobot5050","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54747-22682572-c59e-4cda-963d-1f261ad41780-1566236779"}

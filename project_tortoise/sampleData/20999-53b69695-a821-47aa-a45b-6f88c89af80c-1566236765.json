His bumped off socialist organisers as he was consolidating power and the relatives and idealogical supporters of these people are understandably upset about it. Further, many would criticize his methods because in order to reach his goal he siezed power from an elected government. In many ways his actions are parallel to those of Franco, but his economic agenda was much more lasse-faire, possibly due to the influence of Thatcher.\r\n\r\nThe Chilean economy is one of the healthiest in South America. While discussing South American basketcase economies the wikipedia article for South America states \"The exception is Chile, which has been successfully implementing free market economic policies since the 1980s and increased its social spending since the return of democratic rule in the early 1990s. This has led to economic stability and interest rates in the low single digits.\" It also has a strong rule of law and strong representative system. The current leader is from the notional left but like successful British and Australian notional-left leaders has avoided government interference in the economy.\r\n\r\nBritain has had a long connection with Chile (which is a bit unusual as it's Spanish speaking) and Margaret Thatcher forged a friendship with Pinochet as they were basically working towards the same ends. Thatcher was also successful at transitioning a basket case economy into a functional one and her opponents will always vehemently hate her for it.\r\n\r\nOne of the other comments on the level with this one says \"there were plenty of people who feared that her government would slide toward some kind of fascism\". This opinion is common but is a *complete and utter misrepresentation of Thatcher*. Thatcher was one of the most anti-fascist leaders of the twentieth century. She believed in individual freedom (including voting to support homosexual's rights when most of the rest of her party were opposing it), she reduced the size of government at a time when nobody else had been willing to take on this task (large government is synonymous with fascism and other idealogies that claim to be something else but end up being very similar to fascism) and she fought special privileges like tariffs. One of the major authors she cited as her inspiration for this was Frederich Hayek who has written an essay called \"The Road to Serfdom\" which discusses the threat of Fascism and emphasises the importance of keeping government small and weak.\r\n","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uc9i","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808254,"author":"cratuki","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cucsp","edited":false,"id":"cudas","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20999-53b69695-a821-47aa-a45b-6f88c89af80c-1566236765"}

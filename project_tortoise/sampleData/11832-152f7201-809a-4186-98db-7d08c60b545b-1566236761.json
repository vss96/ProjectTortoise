{"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tsa7","controversiality":0,"body":"I can say with certainty that most of the people who I have seen teach OO don't really get it. Every professor I have had at school has introduced OO like it is a brand new concept, even at the master's level.\r\n\r\nI think most text book authors and teachers focus way too much on OO design. Everything is about the objects, with no thought given to the UI or database design. The end result is an unworkable mess.\r\n\r\nSo for the last 10 years our schools have been churining out people who know what they are doing is wrong, but don't know what the right way is. A lot of them see patterns as a way out of their problem, not realizing that they are just replacing one bad theory with another.\r\n\r\nIf our authors and professors would just teach objects and patterns as tools to assist in design, rather than as design methods in and of themselves, we would be much better off. But that would expose the truth, that the vast majority of these people don't actually know how to design software and shouldn't be writing about or teaching it.\r\n","score":-4,"ups":-4,"created_utc":1165427124,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","id":"ctv07","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctttx","author":"grauenwolf","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807911,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11832-152f7201-809a-4186-98db-7d08c60b545b-1566236761"}

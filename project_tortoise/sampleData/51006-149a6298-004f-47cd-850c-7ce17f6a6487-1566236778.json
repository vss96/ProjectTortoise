We sit in a huge stream of energy, flowing from the sun out into space, and without this evolution would not happen.  Evolution basically swaps an intelligent designer for a low entropy source of energy.\r\n\r\nBut what causes the low entropy source of energy?  Normally you have the story of how gravity pulls clouds of matter together until the temperature rises to the point where fusion can happen etc etc, but in one sense it is just an obfuscating the basic question, \"why was the universe created in such a ridiculously low state of entropy - a state which allows evolution to happen\"?  This is a question that has not been solved by anyone.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51006-149a6298-004f-47cd-850c-7ce17f6a6487-1566236778"}

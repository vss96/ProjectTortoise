{"body":"From the article:\r\n\r\n&gt;Why does Israel have to set aside its own supreme national interest — peace with all its neighbours — in favour of the niceties of its relations with a foreign government?\r\n\r\nPerhaps they are not setting aside their national interest.  \r\n\r\nThe author of the article doesn't realize that Israel has demonstrated through its actions (or in this case, non-action) that it believes that staying on the good side of America is more in their interest than negotiating with Syria.\r\n\r\nWhy would this be?  Suppose Israel opted to negotiate with their neighbors, was dropped from list of American friends as a result, was then double crossed by their neighbors, and then America did not come back to help as Israel was off the friends list.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it looks to me as if Israel trusts America to keep its word more than they trust their neighbors.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vija","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":14,"ups":14,"created_utc":1166647985,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"keylime","edited":false,"id":"cvjjk","parent_id":"t3_vija","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809052,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41741-2c5ef47d-6367-4d1c-a4a1-8fb913ef6f85-1566236774"}

Unfortunately I was in a pinch when I bought it and didn't have the time to shop around, so I was limited to what was on the lot.\r\n\r\nI wish the fuel economy was better, but other than that I can't complain about the performance. (But then, I'm not sure I know enough about cars to tell you if it was particularly bad or good).\r\n\r\nWhat bothers me about it is the inattention to details. For example, the LS model has foglights. I don't have the LS model, so instead of foglights, I just have a hole in the front bumper where the foglights would go. You'd never see that in a foreign car.\r\n\r\nThe cupholder for the driver is on the left side of the steering wheel. Great position for th 1 in 9 Americans who are left handed. I'm not.\r\n\r\nThe car has two cigarette lighters in the front. Nice, if you're like me and like car gadgetry. Stupid, because they placed them such that any device that sticks out of the cigarette lighter blocks the lever when I try to shift into park.\r\n\r\nThe thing came with a CD player, standard. You can't get it with a cassette player. The storage in the middle? Designed to hold cassettes, not CD's.\r\n\r\nIt's stupid shit like that that annoys me. Next time I buy a car, the first thing I'm checking is where the cupholder is. If it's not in a smart place, I'm walking away.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167601171,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60799-7b921721-4a6c-4b22-b083-403c65c38e74-1566236780"}

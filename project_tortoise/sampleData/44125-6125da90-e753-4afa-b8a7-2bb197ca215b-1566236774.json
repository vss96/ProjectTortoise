They want to design stuff. I had one look at just a smidgen of code once and she freaked out; no exaggeration either. *freaked out*.\r\n\r\nThe other side of the coin is the web designer who knows just enough about coding to be truly dangerous. In one case a designer figured out how to iterate over a tree of objects by copying code from other pages; performance tanked and we had to trace the problem.\r\n\r\nYou'd be better off training your programmers to design stuff. Most programmers come up with designs like reddit.com (which, as it happens, is what I like too :o) I think most of the Web 2.0 sites are programmer-designed (flickr, del.ico.us, etc). I like teasing my designer by saying \"HTML should be generated by machines, not people.\"","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44125-6125da90-e753-4afa-b8a7-2bb197ca215b-1566236774"}

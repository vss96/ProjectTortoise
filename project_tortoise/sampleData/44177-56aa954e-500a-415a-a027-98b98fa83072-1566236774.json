They may have had some group of causes which are at work now. But believing that would require that we explain what’s happening to all the CO2 (for example) which we are producing now and which our models show would cause the kind of warming we are measuring.\r\n\r\nYou can walk into a virgin forest and see fallen trees. Trees die of beetles, fungus, old age, fire, drought, wind, and a dozen other causes, some of which we don’t understand. Sometimes huge groups of them die together.

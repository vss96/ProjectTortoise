These kids are not being forced there, and speaking as a kid who once attended a Christian summer camp and had a great time, I think that people may be reading a whole lot more into this than is needed. Hey if anyone has any true evidence of actual browbeating, show me -- and I will have to agree that at least in *this* instance, *this* camp was wrong. It does not however entitle anyone to make a blanket statement that all kids attending summer camps, or church -- are brainwashed. All cases must be examined uniquely and objectively.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ua04","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808208,"author":"CarlH","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuavb","parent_id":"t1_cuasf","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19732-bd1dfe20-05fd-49d6-a062-8a7ea029c192-1566236764"}

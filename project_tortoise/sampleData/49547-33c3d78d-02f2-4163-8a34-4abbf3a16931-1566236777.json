If you want to talk formal, mine is formal because it complies with social perspectives on rights. You're gonna go to China and ask the President, \"Why do you violate your citizen's right to free speech?\"\r\n\r\nYour usage is just some crappy rarely-used philosophy 101 usage. If you want to talk that way, fine, but it's a minority usage that is only applicable in specific scopes. As long as we're speaking about civil rights, they are dependant on which civil society we're talking about.\r\n\r\nDo you say, \"In America, we have civil rights.\" or do you say, \"In America, the government does not violate civil rights.\" \r\n\r\nthe very fact that people say, \"We have civil rights\" or say \"our civil rights\" implies that rights can be given and lost depending on the context. \r\n\r\nYour usage is shitty and just adds more foliage to the language which is totally useless to everyone, except philosophy students who need to add filler to reach the word count on their essays.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_trab","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1167031481,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49547-33c3d78d-02f2-4163-8a34-4abbf3a16931-1566236777"}

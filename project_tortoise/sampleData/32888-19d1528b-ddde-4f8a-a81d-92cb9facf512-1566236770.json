I'm already thinking how to write an article to compare and contrast Haskell and Java solutions. The main idea is that his solution is specific to JavaCC object model, a way of iterating it, etc., while mine is not. If the parse tree datastrucutures change, I'll have to change one line of code while he'll have to rewrite the whole solution. Considering how much time he says he spent on the solution (about an hour), we both spent about the same amount of time. However, if I ever have to maintain the thing, I'm way ahead of him simply because of my language choice.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uzuc","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166308641,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32888-19d1528b-ddde-4f8a-a81d-92cb9facf512-1566236770"}

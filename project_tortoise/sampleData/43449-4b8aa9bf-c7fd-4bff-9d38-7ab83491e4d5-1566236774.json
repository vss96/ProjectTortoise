After all is said and done, and his sentence is upheld, not only will the boy's life be ruined, but he will probably be another sad by-product of our justice system. Think about it. When he gets out, he'll have a decent chunk of his life ahead of him, which can be a good thing, but think about all that resentment for what could have been. He was a decent student and a promising athlete and he had a bright future ahead of him, but it was stomped out by some crappy legislation. He will hate the \"system\" forever. That animosity coupled with the hardening he will receive in prison, is a recipe for yet another potential member of society with a life riddled with crime because really, what's the use of trying to pick up the pieces of your life and make good with them? Your life is pretty much kaibash-ed. Why not take your anger and resentment out on the system and commit a few more crimes, maybe a few rapes or two. Might as well, you're a certified rapist right? \r\n\r\nHowever, I could be wrong about all of this, and he could find \"enlightenment\" during his incarceration, and blend into our society quite well once he's released, but really, what are the chances of that? Another good life ruined...","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vlsg","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43449-4b8aa9bf-c7fd-4bff-9d38-7ab83491e4d5-1566236774"}

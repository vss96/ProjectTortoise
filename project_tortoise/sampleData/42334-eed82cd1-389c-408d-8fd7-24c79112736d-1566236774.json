Pressing the \"context menu\" button on your keyboard will pop up the selected window's window menu.\r\n\r\nYou can also select multiple taskbar tasks by clicking on them while holding Control; they'll be treated as a \"window group\" to your actions (the same thing windows XP creates when you have, e.g. 32 Firefox windows open.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOther crazy things:\r\n\r\n* Shift + [Enter or double clicking]: run the second (first non-default) item in the object's context menu. On a folder, this is \"Explore\".\r\n\r\n* Alt + [Enter or double clicking]: the last context menu selection -- Properties.\r\n\r\n* F10 works just like tapping Alt to access menus.\r\n\r\n* F6: Move between control panes (in Explorer; in Firefox, this just focuses the Address bar)\r\n\r\n* Alt(+Shift)+F6: Switch between the different windows owned by a single process, such as browser windows, or a program's  dialog boxes.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vhwi","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809076,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"derefr","id":"cvkp2","parent_id":"t1_cvilm","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42334-eed82cd1-389c-408d-8fd7-24c79112736d-1566236774"}

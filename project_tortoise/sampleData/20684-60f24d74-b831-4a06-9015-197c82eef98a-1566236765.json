The only way to stop it is to **put fear of life into sadistic cops** and the only way to do that, really, is for thousands of people to take to the streets and attempt to storm the worst of the worst of the jails in our nation.

I seriously wouldn't mind risking my life again to bring an end to this grave injustice that afflicts so many more of our largely defenseless nationfolk than you care to imagine.\r\n\r\nThe movement to change the direction of our planet started in 2006; what are you doing?\r\n\r\n(btw, i live in Brazoria County, also part of this vid :-/)","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808243,"gilded":0,"id":"cucrb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ubo5","author":"hopeseekr","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20684-60f24d74-b831-4a06-9015-197c82eef98a-1566236765"}

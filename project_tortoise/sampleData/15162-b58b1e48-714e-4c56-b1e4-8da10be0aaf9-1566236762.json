What these folks have done is layer several different types of junctions together using funky materials, fancy techniques, and a lot of cleverness.\r\n\r\nThese different junctions absorb energy from different frequency ranges, so combined they can get 40% efficiency -- at the cost of being difficult and expensive to produce.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15162-b58b1e48-714e-4c56-b1e4-8da10be0aaf9-1566236762"}

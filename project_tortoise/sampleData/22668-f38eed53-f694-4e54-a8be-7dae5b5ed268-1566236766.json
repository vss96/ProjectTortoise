More over, they would not erroneously claim that Christmas was \"ordained by the Almighty\". But is \"Christmas\" Christian? WTF? Of course it is... The date of the celebration is irrelevant. It is probably December 25th because prior to Christmas it was a common celebration date. And there are many symbolic carry-overs from the Winter solstice, and Christmas.  Next you will be posting about Easter isn't celebrated on the right day -- infact, it is celebrated on multiple days.","link_id":"t3_ufrl","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808313,"distinguished":null,"author":"Draracle","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cugh4","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ufrl","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22668-f38eed53-f694-4e54-a8be-7dae5b5ed268-1566236766"}

After all, a little more violence never hurt anyone?\r\n\r\nHonestly, if you have to resort to fists the situation is already out of your control. \r\n\r\nNow I agree that the typical female social structure seems mystifying and nasty, where people are allowed to be passive aggressive at one another and the colour of your shoes can determine your acceptance more then your character.\r\n\r\nBut the male system has its flaws too.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at the two groups in isolation:\r\n\r\n For example if you put a group of females in isolation (i.e. a women’s prison) they form a quasi-family structure. Your acceptance is determined by being someone’s sister, or in other words, how well you network. If you mess up, you get beaten up.\r\n\r\nIn a male prison, your manhood is the guarded factor. If you’re not naturally physically able you become someone’s bitch (for lack of a better term), typically raped and more likely to be murdered then the lowest female in the pecking order.\r\n\r\nThus the point I’m hammering at is that if women beat, rape and murdered each other as men do, the bitchy exploitive group members would probably be just as likely to be the ones beating, raping and murdering, if not more so since their level of empathy is less.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vn76","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809168,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Phia","id":"cvpg7","parent_id":"t3_vn76","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44740-47c0ea47-c1cb-4b35-be2d-d7ed00d1b513-1566236774"}

I couldn't disagree more.\r\n\r\nHere's some of what I see religion caused when I look through our human history: the Inquisition of the Jews, the Catholic Church selling indulgences, burning women at the stake because good \"Christians\" think they're witches, the notion that \"Muslims are evil\" (both in the Crusades and now), Muslims hate the dirty Jews, the Christians hate the dirty Jews, slavery is OK because Europeans are Godly and the slaves are not, \"we are the chosen people and brown boy is a Godless macaca\", overpopulation through inhibiting condom use, the extent of the AIDS epidemic because religious people said early on that it was God's punishment to gays (and Africans, apparently), killing the \"Godless\" Native Americans, perpetuating the notion that women are subservient to men, etc... Should I go on?\r\n\r\nNow, here is a REAL CHALLENGE: Name one thing that the practice of religious ideas has done that's been positive for humankind on a large scale?\r\n\r\nYOU CAN'T. Because there isn't one. The idea does NO GOOD on a large scale. And it does SO MUCH HARM.\r\n\r\nThe \"tenets of the faith\" are ALWAYS used as a tool of corrupt power on a large scale. It'd be nice if this were not the case, but it is.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_td06","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165114169,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4337-3085e883-0aa5-425d-9b4d-0d300b64536e-1566236759"}

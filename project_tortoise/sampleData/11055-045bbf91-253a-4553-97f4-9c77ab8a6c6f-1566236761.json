{"body":"While we're \"fixing\" Java's type system, it would be good if we could do such things as provide a meaningful generalisation of the monadic bind operation (and all the other things that having this ability implies).\r\n\r\nAs it stands, generics are (yet another) failure of an already flawed type system and the primary goal now should be providing a means of migration. i.e. compiling more powerful programming (no not Lisp if you're reading this Mr. Graham!) languages to the VM.\r\n\r\nIf we're achieving that goal, when is Sun going to introduce tail call elimination[1] to the VM? Microsoft are going to win the arms race with their \"poor man's functional language\" (F#) if we don't see anything from Sun soon.\r\n\r\nOh, and what about google? What are they going to do about it? :)\r\n\r\n[1] http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4726340\r\n\r\n* I tried to post on the blog, but for whatever reason, I am asked to \"visually verify\" an image that doesn't appear (and an attempt to request it myself responds with 404).

Things are not quite as bad in Australia, but you can bet they will follow the Americans slavishly, as they do in most other things.\r\n\r\nThis sort of police behavior is unheard of in Thailand, except when ex-PM Thaksin ordered the police to eliminate all the drug dealers. Over 1,000 people died as a result, mostly small dealers. Now, the drug business is handled more professionally by the big boys (police, army, politicians), so we don't hear about it much, ergo; the drug problem has been 'eliminated'. \r\n\r\nBut that was a small 'blip'. We are lucky here that the police are so poorly paid that they are much more concerned with making ends meet. So traffic violations are quickly solved with a bank note slipped behind the license. I knew of one Thai a few years ago who killed his boss drug kingpin. It cost him 3 million Baht (about $85,000) to get out of it. \r\n\r\nSo, in America you have a violent and often confrontational police force. Here we have the best law enforcement money can buy! Corruption does have its benefits. I know which system I prefer.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31908-16713f0e-2d93-41de-be1b-58d13fdded79-1566236770"}

If you hate yoursef for not working long hours, off you go. I hope you like web application development. If you like having your entire life and being defined by your employment, fine. Help yourself.

As a development manager I know well how much business value such folks can produce and I like to have a few around on my teams. And also other people with all the other skills that make teams work.\r\n\r\nIt's coming to something when Google, which has saught to make being employed into an indefinite prolongation of comp sci graduate school, can be seen as a poor choice of employer for the \"talented\".","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t576","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807498,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"keithb","id":"ct90w","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct5vk","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1552-894dcdaf-46e6-4e2f-b82b-27d6b0e58966-1566236758"}

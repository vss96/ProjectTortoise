{"controversiality":0,"body":"You raise a good point regarding religion. My argument, though, focuses on the simple existence of any supernatural being.\r\n\r\nWhile it may be the case that if you disprove someone's religion to them they are less inclined to take up *any* further religion, that is the fault of the individual for not thinking logically.\r\n\r\nI personally was raised Christian, but do not follow it so much because of such inconsistencies and silly sections of the Bible. I did not, though, accept the fact that there is/are no [gG]od(s) or anything beyond the physical world, but that is probably due to my philosophical studies as well. Hence, I ascribe to be agnostic.\r\n\r\nI simply wanted to point out that one silly religion shouldn't be enough to make someone atheist... it should be much deeper than that.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tu1t","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165430837,"author":"transcendent","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctvaq","parent_id":"t1_ctuth","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807917,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12007-57c85592-2a04-46ae-b17f-fa3f036f228a-1566236761"}

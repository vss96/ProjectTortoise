For example, suppose that you want to write a function which returned an HTTP response (for a CGI script or something). If you had to make a bunch of these functions, you might want to abstract out the common parts, like sending the HTTP headers and the HTML &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; and the final &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;. You could use a decorator like this:\r\n\r\n    @web_page\r\n    def hello_world():\r\n        print '&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;'\r\n\r\nWhere web_page is just a function that returns a function which prints out the headers, calls the function that the decorator was given (in this case, hello_world), and then prints out the footers.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167599109,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"cwkp3","parent_id":"t1_cwk20","author_flair_text":null,"author":"sketerpot","retrieved_on":1473809756,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60731-c97679ef-b275-4524-99ab-48a54d4551c3-1566236780"}

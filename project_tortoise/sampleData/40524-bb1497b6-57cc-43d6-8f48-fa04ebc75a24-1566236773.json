{"body":"&gt;\"DO NOT RUN THAT .EXE FILE\" \r\n\r\nMy understanding was the the rootkit self installed from an \"audio\" CD... not a suspicious .exe attachment from an email - but an audio CD, from a high street store. The media puts plenty focus on computer security and people are much more aware than they used to be about the need for firewall / antivirus, but this behavior is worthy of the outrage - People don't need one more attack vector on their PC and should be able to trust things produced by large companies such as Sony. Not that I care, my Linux and OSX computers are nicely immune to Sony's antics... and not that I'd have bought ANY of the albums listed with the rootkit... quite why anyone would want to copy Cyndi Lauper - The Body Acoustic is beyond me...\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vfw5","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":6,"score":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166608077,"author":"turbo-tom","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvgj5","id":"cvh0x","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809004,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40524-bb1497b6-57cc-43d6-8f48-fa04ebc75a24-1566236773"}

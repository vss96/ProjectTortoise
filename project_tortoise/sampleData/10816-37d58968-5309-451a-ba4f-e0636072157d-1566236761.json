If the wealthy are looking for the best possible investment I don't think actual physical objects (including land) are their best options.\r\n\r\n&gt; Hence the self-perpetuating aspect of wealth.\r\n\r\nYeah, I'll grant that there is some of that because of the physical capital angle you pointed out earlier. For the most part I think it's ownership of land and resources like oil and coal which perpetuate this kind of thing.\r\n\r\n&gt; The current trend shows us that wealth is being hoarded; hence the increasing disparity.\r\n\r\nI don't think disparity necessarily indicates that. Though, I'm not sure it indicates the opposite either.\r\n\r\n&gt; This is not a problem that the market can fix, since the inherent inequalities in the market produced the problem in the first place.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand how the market produces the problem. It seems more like the problem is produced by fixed resources (land etc.).","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165382279,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10816-37d58968-5309-451a-ba4f-e0636072157d-1566236761"}

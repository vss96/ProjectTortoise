Feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick an imprisoned is one way (and a really good one, at that) to glorify God.  But it's not the only way.  The well-fed, fully clothed and healthy artist who hasn't yet heard the Gospel -- sometimes she needs to see the splendor of God to understand the full importance of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nIt's not either/or, it's both/and.  The Church should feed the hungry *and* speak to the souls of those who, though well-fed, crave beauty.

I only started programming in 1995 or so, in Visual Basic 4 (UGH).  I've come a long way, and along the way, bumped into, or actually had the need, to write an embedded app on an 8051 mcu.  I had to use C, and since then have not had the desire to look at another language.  It's just so together.  C for my heavy work or utility programs, and C# on Windows and Linux for all my productivity apps.  I briefly checked out Ruby, and it put my Linux box into runtime lib version HELL.  JUST LIKE Windows DLL hell.  A little worse even.  Ruby is neat, but the version dependencies just killed it for me.  Back to C.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vqbu","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809222,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nik_martin","id":"cvsc3","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vqbu","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46191-dded182d-ae2b-4382-b8b1-6625b9ed7ec6-1566236775"}

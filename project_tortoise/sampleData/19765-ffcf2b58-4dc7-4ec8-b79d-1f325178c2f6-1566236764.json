{"controversiality":1,"body":"I dont believe it is your place or anyone else's to decide what kind of place someone can go to. It is not your place or anyone else's to define \"metaphysical teachings given as uncontested truth\" and then to reject people from going to places that you feel meet that definition. It is up to the parents to decide if a place is good for their kids, not to mention themselves -- to go to. Further, while I agree that kids are not necessarily ok if they are enjoying themselves, I see nothing about Christian summer camps that somehow harm kids. You know, the people who run these camps -- they truly care about these kids. This seems to be an overlooked fact, but people who run churches, and kid's camps, and these types of events -- do so out of the kindness of their hearts, and out of care for the kids who attend. Unless there is a genuine thing happening that is harming a kid, then there is no harm.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ua04","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165732205,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"CarlH","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuaxl","parent_id":"t1_cuavy","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808209,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19765-ffcf2b58-4dc7-4ec8-b79d-1f325178c2f6-1566236764"}

I happen to volunteer twice a week at an outpatient rehab. \r\n\r\nYes people destroy themselves with hard drugs. But when drugs aren't available they'll turn to sniffing glue, like the street children in some SA cities. They'll also sniff gas, paint fumes, distill alcohol, and do everything short of hitting themselves in the head with bricks. Why? Cause they're miserable.\r\n\r\nI think an experiment I read about illustrates it best. Rats, kept in a normal labratory cage and offered cocaine quickly became addicted. However, when the rats were put in a large cage with diverse food, lots of places to hide and play, and a healthy balance population of theur own kind, they did not become addicted and addicted rats quit. Aiming machine guns at people and locking them in tiny cages is not how to stop people from abusing drugs, especially when the people pointing the weapons are just as likely to use drugs as anyone else. There's more drugs in prison than out.\r\n\r\nDimwits like you who want mommy daddy government to take your rights away at gun point should be exiled to an island where you can all dress up and point guns at each other away from the sane people.","link_id":"t3_uf7k","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23594-d7a6bddf-ecf9-4581-a7a4-6a3a824a1583-1566236766"}

{"body":"&gt; our economy's output would slow as our labor market despecialized.\r\n\r\nYes, cheap Chinese goods have been a huge deflationary force.  But I'm far from certain the gutting of American manufacturing in favor of cheap imports has been a blessing.  I'm not sure what this \"specialization\" you talk about is.\r\n\r\nWith the loss of manufacturing the US economy is now driven by the issuance of debt and financial products, and the expansion of suburban sprawl.  The American economy is now Wall Street and new subdivisions and Walmarts.\r\n\r\nDespite what people probably think here, tech is less than 2% of the US economy and substantially less than 2% of the workforce.  The US is actually a net importer of high tech capital goods.  The \"information economy\" never happened.  The manufacturing economy just disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe don't make anything anymore.  This is not healthy or sustainable.  We should be making useful things, not more debt and sprawl.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vct7","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166550317,"author":"kkrev","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvdr1","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvdoh","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808940,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38766-52120f23-3871-4d11-8223-1822f3a86207-1566236773"}

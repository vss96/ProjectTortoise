You'd need a standard for negotiating with a base station over payment for airtime, as well as with a computer in the target area code to dial out the call and connect it.  Your phone queries a directory in that area code &amp; gets a list of available outlets and their price and quality guarantees (signed, so the base station can't tamper with it).  As long as the combined cost isn't more than your limit, you just get connected upon hitting send, otherwise the phone asks you if you want to pay.  Unfortunately, this scheme would still need some distributed form of micropayments, and handoff could be tricky.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807544,"gilded":0,"id":"ctbg3","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tbfb","author":"ejegg","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2905-6da4cf08-01a3-4bf8-96dc-a99c9f3f666d-1566236759"}

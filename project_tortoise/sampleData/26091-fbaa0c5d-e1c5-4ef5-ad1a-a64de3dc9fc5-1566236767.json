The reason people want to work for Nike and Walmart is that it's better than their other alternatives.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Nike and Walmart would prefer for the people they employ to remain poor.  But they can't avoid helping people by employing them for more than farm wages.  And the more companies that compete for third world labor, the higher wages will rise.\r\n\r\nIt's like economist David Henderson says, you don't help the poor by looking at their list of options and eliminating the one they actually choose.  Sure, the situation in third world countries is far from ideal.  Ideally, governments everywhere would stop being such assholes, regulating, taxing, and killing their own citizens to the point where nobody can be an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nYou have to ask yourself, what is really preventing people in these countries from becoming rich?  If they could make more starting businesses and working for each other, they would.  Nike and Walmart can't stop them.  Only their governments can, and do.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165972054,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cun8q","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cumm7","author":"asokoloski","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808440,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26091-fbaa0c5d-e1c5-4ef5-ad1a-a64de3dc9fc5-1566236767"}

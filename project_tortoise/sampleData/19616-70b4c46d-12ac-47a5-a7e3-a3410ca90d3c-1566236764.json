Now if this is true, it is arguable that these infants dying and going to this afterlife is much better than suffering on earth anyway.\r\n\r\nSo God in taking the lives of infants isn't wrong. He didn't really take anything from them, as they just went from a limited, less than great existence to one with no worries.\r\n\r\nBut again, God is the only one with that authority. The one who gave life has the right to take it away. Human beings do not have the authority over the lives of other human beings. You have no right to take my life and I have no right to take yours.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808204,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuam9","edited":false,"id":"cuanj","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19616-70b4c46d-12ac-47a5-a7e3-a3410ca90d3c-1566236764"}

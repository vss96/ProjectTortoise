Its a very risky game and is the cause of this.\r\n\r\nHmmmm, until last year, the Yuan was pegged to the dollar. 8 yuan  per dollar, completely flat for years, decades even. Then they allowed it to float a little, about 3%/day. Since then the Yuan has been gradually appreciating relative to the dollar, but at 3% it's going to take years.\r\n\r\nI think the drop in the dollar is for another reason entirely. Historically, the level of the dollar had to be maintained to keep everyone happy with their dollar reserves. Well Bush effectively said \"fuck that\" and has been borrowing/creating/spending pretty much as fast as he can. I think you know what it's being spent on. You see, you can't finance a war with conventional taxation, people simply won't pay taxes to have the value blown up, never mind the conscious thought that their money is killing people. So you borrow/print the stuff instead.\r\n\r\nAnyway, lots more dollars and no real attempts to hold the level high, it begins to fall in value. The holders start to look for a better place to keep their value and more dollars enter the market accelerating the fall. \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808439,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cun5k","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cumr8","author":"css1971","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26038-00d5af65-9ee6-40db-b580-064b420e0f87-1566236767"}

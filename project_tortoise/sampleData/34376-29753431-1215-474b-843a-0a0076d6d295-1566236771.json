Who are you?  He is, he doesn't have to conform to our \"expectations\", God is and we conform to him.\r\n\r\nAs I said before it is not a manual, the purpose is achieved in the apparent inconsistency.  For those who would come to the book to try and control the lives of others, or find some \"code\" for their lives, their efforts are defeated.  Faced with this defeat they either deny it and become deceivers or repent from their arrogance and seek a relationship with God, knowing that it is not enough for them to approach the bible as lawyers.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v1y6","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34376-29753431-1215-474b-843a-0a0076d6d295-1566236771"}

This would be doubly helpful on OS X, because other than the dock they seem to believe opening \"Applications\" is the best way to run a program.  That needs to be simplified- either a program menu like listing, or the aforemntioned organization and a desktop link.  I mean, I do all of this stuff, but it'd be nice if was laid out for users.

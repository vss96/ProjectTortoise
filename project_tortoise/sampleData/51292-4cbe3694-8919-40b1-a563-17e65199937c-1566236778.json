{"controversiality":0,"body":"This kind of story lends credence to the idea that the Iraq war has something to do with 9-11.\r\n\r\nI suppose it's useful in that conservatives or right-leaning mainstream voters who still link the two might start questioning the war.  \"Useful,\" that is, if you believe that the war should have an end.  A surprising number of my acquaintances (who have no friends or family in the military, it should be noted) are not uneasy with the idea of the war going on indefinitely, and seem to believe that it's literally a war against terror, and that every Iraqi death is one less terrorist in the world.  Though to be honest I am not sure there is any argument that can persuade them.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that there was no justification whatsoever to invade Iraq.  It wasn't weapons of mass destruction, it wasn't terrorism, and it certainly wasn't 9-11.  Unfortunately, that truth makes for a less interesting soundbyte.","link_id":"t3_w17c","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167150361,"score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"cilium","parent_id":"t3_w17c","edited":false,"id":"cw2el","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809412,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51292-4cbe3694-8919-40b1-a563-17e65199937c-1566236778"}

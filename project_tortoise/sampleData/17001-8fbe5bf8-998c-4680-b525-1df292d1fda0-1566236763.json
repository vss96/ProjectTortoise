Great selection there. \r\n\r\nI'm an old school punk, my sister took me to see the Ramones at CBGB's in 1976. I was listening to Yes, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath when I was 16 years old. Seeing the Ramones there changed that forever. Had the chance to see The Clash, Bad Brains, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag and many others in their heyday.\r\n\r\nToday I've sorta mellowed, but I will crank up an old classic punk tune once in a while.\r\n","link_id":"t3_u4v2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808117,"distinguished":null,"author":"artman","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu614","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u4v2","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17001-8fbe5bf8-998c-4680-b525-1df292d1fda0-1566236763"}

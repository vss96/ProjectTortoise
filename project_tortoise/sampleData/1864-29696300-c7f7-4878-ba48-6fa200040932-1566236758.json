I like it because doesn't just say \"declare your variables first\" or \"declare your variables where they are used\", he actually goes into details on why (p244-251). While you may disagree with him, at least you can make an informed decision rather than just arguing preference.\r\n\r\nThough I did find I lot of sections obvious, as did my coworkers. But we found different sections to be obvious, implying that they were both needed.\r\n\r\nMy favorite section was where he considered actual studies on the effectiveness of various testing techniques. While he didn't claim any silver bullets, code reviews were by far the most effective. Unit and regression testing actually ended up being the least effective. Of course, he pointed out that a combination of methods is preferable.\r\n\r\n&gt; And some of the advice, particularly the \"Defensive Programming\" section seems flat-out damaging. \r\n\r\nI'll bite. What specifically did you have a problem with?\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1864-29696300-c7f7-4878-ba48-6fa200040932-1566236758"}

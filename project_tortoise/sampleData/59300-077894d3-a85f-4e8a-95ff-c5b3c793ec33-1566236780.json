The only reason to get a larger set in my opinion is for a larger room. I could see a slightly larger set that would get a bit of benefit from 1080, but the returns are already diminishing at this point. Subjectively my 720p set gives a great picture, and while 1080 might be marginally better I can't see it providing anywhere near the perceptual improvement in quality over 720p than 720p gives over 480p. And the 1440p  resolutions listed in the graph? I can't imagine anyone wanting to watch  a 60\" screen from 5 feet away.\r\n\r\nI can see applications for ultra-high res displays, but no for watching television or movies. Computer monitors where you might want to focus on a small part of the display will benefit from such overkill resolutions. Virtual reality displays would be another app.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I realize that my preferences differ from the theater recommendations discussed in the article. Maybe it's just me, but I prefer to be able to take in the entire screen easily rather than have it fill my field of vision so much that I have to look back and forth to take everything in. At a previous apartment my same TV was directly across from a couch that was 9-10 feet from the screen, and I felt that that was near the minimum comfortable viewing distance (from a position directly in front of the screen).\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59300-077894d3-a85f-4e8a-95ff-c5b3c793ec33-1566236780"}

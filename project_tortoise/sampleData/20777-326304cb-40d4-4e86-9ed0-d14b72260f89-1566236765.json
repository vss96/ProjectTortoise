Discuss string theory. Discuss the origin of the big bang. \r\n\r\nNow, if you honestly dont think Richard Dawkins is doing everything in his power to create an environment where a child is more likely to become an atheist, then you disagree with Dawkins himself! \"I could well imagine that this linguistically coded freedom to choose might lead children to choose no religion at all!\" --- now, is he stating this as a *BAD* thing? Of course not!\r\n\r\nFurther, there is *NOTHING* in my post that is 'starting with a premise, and then assuming it to be true' --- The *ONLY* thing in the above post is talking about Richard Dawkins' *OWN VIEWS* on religion among kids. How you can possibly construe that as a 'religious debate' is beyond me.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20777-326304cb-40d4-4e86-9ed0-d14b72260f89-1566236765"}

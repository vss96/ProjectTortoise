Or at least, you don't get to be on mine.\r\n\r\n&gt; Dawkins explains clearly, although, and unfortunately for the lazy Mr. Cornwell, in the body text, that these were both, in fact, religious movements - Pagan nationalism (the Nebelung et. al.) in the case of the Nazis and an ultimate-judge personality cult in the case of Stalin, who saw himself as a rival to God and, in the words of Richard Lourie, \"finally succeeded in defeating God at loneliness\" with his hit on Trotsky.\r\n\r\nWhich is bullshit. Hitler was pretty fucking crazy by anyone's standards, and some of his henchmen even worse than he. But to say that the nazi movement was \"religious\" is to mischaracterize it. I don't buy it, and most sociologists wouldn't either. Dawkins should stick to evolutionary biology, he's not a sociologist.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Nazis weren't their own religion, then Stalin definitely wasn't one.\r\n\r\nIt might be tempting to try to foist off **all** of history's atrocities on religion, but it's wrong. Fuck, they're guilty of so many already, why bother to try to pin these two on them? It's like some smalltown sheriff, having caught the serial killer, he's now trying to blame every killing on him in the town's history.","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167020687,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvyma","id":"cvyo3","edited":false,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809343,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49400-99155531-89da-4432-a4c5-a0cf76506f55-1566236777"}

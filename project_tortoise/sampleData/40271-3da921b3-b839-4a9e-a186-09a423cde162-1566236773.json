The matchtime option sets the number of tenths of a second to show the matching paren (default is 5).\r\n\r\nIn Vim 7.0, there's a standard plugin called matchparen for highlighting matching parens as long as the cursor is pointing at one. You can type\r\n\r\n    :help matchparen\r\n\r\nto get information about it.

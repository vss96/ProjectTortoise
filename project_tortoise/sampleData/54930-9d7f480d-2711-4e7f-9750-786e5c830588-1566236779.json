If you're going to portray gang-members, you're drawing blacks or latinos.  Why should the NRA attempt to be politically correct by showing a bunch of whiggers hanging out at 7-11?  Maybe they could show white biker gangs, but again -- why should the NRA (already hated by those who would cry foul) twist reality to\r\nbe \"racially sensitive?\"\r\n\r\nI don't really care about this \"revelation.\"  It was obviously intended to be distributed to members, and contains clear branding by the NRA.  What's \"secret\" about it?  That it wasn't officially released yet?  In that case, maybe Wonkette should be charged with copyright infringement.  I'd be in trouble if I stole the text of the next Harry Potter book and posted it on my site.\r\n\r\nThe blind partisan campaigning by the NRA{-ILA} in the last election convinced me not to renew my membership, particularly their endorsement of odious candidates such as Tom Reynolds here in Buffalo.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w7hi","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809541,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"QuinnFazigu","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w7hi","id":"cw95j","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54930-9d7f480d-2711-4e7f-9750-786e5c830588-1566236779"}

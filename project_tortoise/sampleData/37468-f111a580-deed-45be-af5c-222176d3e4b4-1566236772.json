The medical technique is this:\r\n\r\nIn order to bypass an aneurysm, typically the arteries surrounding the aneurysm must be clamped so that the aneurysm can be cut open and have an arterial graft sewn to it.\r\n\r\nWith the method documented in the article, the graft is first sewed to the aneurysm, a fiber optic laser is inserted through the graft, and burns/cuts a hole in the side of the aneurysm which feeds directly into the graft.  (Presumably the graft is then clamped) Then the graft is sewn in place, and they're done!  No clamping of major arteries in the brain needed.","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166499656,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37468-f111a580-deed-45be-af5c-222176d3e4b4-1566236772"}

So you'd visit a webpage, see something you wanted to edit, pop up the editor frame, tweak the page, push the \"submit\" button and see it change. (You can still see something like this in browsers like [Amaya](http://www.w3.org/Amaya/).) Much more like wiki than the \"ordinary\" web of today.* To an extent the \"read-only Web\", with its assumption that reading is easy but writing is a Big Deal, dumbs the Web concept down towards towards the level of television. So arguably Firefox *ought* to provide integrated editing out of the box.\r\n\r\nOn the third hand, it seems that making something like the \"read/write Web\" work for more than a few very simple applications involves handling some nasty problems which HTTP doesn't handle - versioning, for example. So on its first outing the r/w Web didn't fail purely because of laziness or skulduggery, but because the mechanism provided was \"simpler than possible\". Which is a reason to be skeptical of the attitude that HTTP is the acme of all perfection.\r\n\r\n\\* Corollary: \"Web 1.0\" isn't.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_wc4o","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809602,"author":"leoc","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwceq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwcbk","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56541-2e2d6b74-0a7c-4fb5-acfa-1040842138f6-1566236779"}

It is more of a lifestyle than anything in the judaeo-christian sense. So that form could be an exception, - I would have to look at it more carefully to judge.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry: The World Trade Center bombings were not motivated by a twisted sort of religious belief ?\r\nThe Sunni-Shia conflict in the middle-east is not a religious one ? The Kashmir issue in India is not\r\nreligion based ? The butchering of thousands during\r\nIndia/Pakistan partition was not a Hindu-Muslim conflict ?\r\nThe Crusades were not based on Christian-Muslim hatred ?\r\nAnd jews have been persecuted for millenia simply because\r\nthey are jews. Judaism is not a religion ?\r\n\r\nIf you think not, I'm sorry but you've got your head stuck\r\nway up your ass - You need to pull it out and get real !\r\n\r\nAnd no I was never abused as a child or anything.

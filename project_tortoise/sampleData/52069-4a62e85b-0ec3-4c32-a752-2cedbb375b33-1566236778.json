The games will determine who wins.  Every consoles launch lineup is questionable - it takes time for the library to develop.  On a flash judgement, I would say that the 360 had the strongest launch lineup - exclusives that showed off the power of the system (PGR3 for example) and a great PC port that ran fast and clean (CoD 2).  The PS3 has Resistance, but it's launch linup appears weaker since the majority of the games are available on both the 360 and the PS3.  The Wii launch line-up is solid due to Zelda, Excite Truck and Wii Sports.  The next 6 to 8 months will shape the next generation - once these systems hit there stride (like the 360 has with games like Gears of War) we'll start to see the winners and losers emerge.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w37e","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167181754,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52069-4a62e85b-0ec3-4c32-a752-2cedbb375b33-1566236778"}

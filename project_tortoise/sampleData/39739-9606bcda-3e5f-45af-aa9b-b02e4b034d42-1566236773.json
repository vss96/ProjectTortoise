{"body":"Yeah, effects vary widely from person to person, and rate of consumption widens those figures further, and 'tolerance' widens it even beyond that.  The legal limit is basically a compromise between worst case scenario and average drinker.  I have no doubt that some people would be totally incapable of driving at 0.05BAC, while others could do just fine with 0.20.  As I understand it, a big part of 'tolerance' isn't so much chemical resistance / optimization at breaking it down as simply getting used to functioning under the effects, like how switching from walking on firm ground to walking on a boat or riding a horse and back again gets easier the more you do it.  If alcoholics wrote the laws, drunk driving accidents would probably skyrocket, **but** most of the people causing the accidents would probably be small / skinny and / or unused to drinking.\r\n\r\nA good test is to read half a beer label, check the time on a wall clock in the bar, and then continue reading without having to find your place.  If you can't do it with a quick glance, your reaction time, focus changing at varying ranges, and information processing skills are going to get you in a car wreck, no matter how well you can walk or how sober you feel.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vd28","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","created_utc":1166572958,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"oditogre","id":"cvfj9","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvec5","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808974,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39739-9606bcda-3e5f-45af-aa9b-b02e4b034d42-1566236773"}

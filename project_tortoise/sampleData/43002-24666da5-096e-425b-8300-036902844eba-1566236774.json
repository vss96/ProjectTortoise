{"controversiality":0,"body":"Look you imbecile, the form of a theory doesn't dictate its contents. It doesn't matter whether or not there are spaces in every theory, because spaces aren't the essence of our universe. Information is. We know this because on the one hand a space without information in it isn't a universe. And on the other hand, the dimensionality of the universe is different from theory to theory. Give up locality and suddenly you can drop an entire dimension. And what do you think that says when a dimension of the universe is an artifact of its other properties?","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vb4k","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166701205,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"richardkulisz","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvm1u","edited":false,"id":"cvm3g","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809102,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43002-24666da5-096e-425b-8300-036902844eba-1566236774"}

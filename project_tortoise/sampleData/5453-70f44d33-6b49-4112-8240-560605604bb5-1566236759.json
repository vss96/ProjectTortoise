No one saw him sign it either. I'd take exception myself.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion authors make:\r\n\r\n\"Putin wanted Blair to silence Alexander Litvinenko in the final hours of his life\"\r\n\r\nExcuse me, how the second follows from first? Did anyone hear Putin to say \"I wish you would make him shut up\" or this is just a conclusion made by author of the article? They do  not quote anyone...\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tg8t","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807658,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"agoldin","edited":false,"id":"cthex","parent_id":"t3_tg8t","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5453-70f44d33-6b49-4112-8240-560605604bb5-1566236759"}

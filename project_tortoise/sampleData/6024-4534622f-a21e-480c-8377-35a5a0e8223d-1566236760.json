Trotting out the same old fallacies all the time will never make them true or even provable. The 'eye' chestnut is yet another example. If you want to take it a step further, or two, if god created the eye and it is so complex and wonderful, why does he create some people blind?  \r\nWhat about the rest of the body? We have already seen how DNA works to build a body and all its parts. Each new discovery only shows how invalid and speciously wrong the creationist examples are.\r\n\r\nRational thinkers have a responsibility to debunk these myths and faith-based beliefs as often as they crop up. Some would say that we are attacking the creationist's very religious foundations. So what? If an idea is so wrong that it can cause major dislocations in thinking and perception of the world, we have to debunk it and try to guide them to a more rational view. \r\n\r\nJeez! Now I sound like one of them, inciting you to proselytize. But seriously, every time we see this type of flawed explanation, don't just sit still. Do something to help them understand reality.\r\n\r\nScience and evolution are not 'belief systems'. The conclusions are based on observation of real, measurable conditions. Can the creationists say the same? \r\n\r\nIf they expect us to believe in their god, what about all the other gods throughout history? Didn't people believe just as strongly in them as Xtians and Mussies do in theirs? Why are their gods any different to Zeus or Rama? \r\n\r\nTo quote the Daleks: Does not compute!

JSON is a _subset_ of the syntax of JavaScript objects, and is not identical to that syntax. In particular, it places a couple of restrictions on identifiers which are meant to make it easy to parse from any language.\r\n2. JavaScript objects bear a striking resemblance to data types in other languages; for example, a valid JSON object will, much of the time, also be a valid Python dictionary.\r\n3. JSON isn't meant to be the 100% solution to all data interchange problems now and forever. It's meant to be a simpler, lightweight alternative to XML for those who don't need eight zillion layers of schema specs, namespace specs, i18n specs, etc. just to grab some data from a remote server.\r\n4. For client-side processing, it's a toss-up. Whether JSON or XML is faster to process in JavaScript usually comes down to the size of the dataset (larger datasets tend to favor XML, smaller datasets tend to favor JSON).\r\n\r\nIn other words... use the right tool for the right job. JSON is just fine for lots and lots and lots of jobs which people previously thought could only be handled by XML, and there are still plenty of jobs which XML is the better choice for.","created_utc":1167178500,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":5,"score":5,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51989-f399d461-580e-441a-b7ce-25139ad4cc53-1566236778"}

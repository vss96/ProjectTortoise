{"body":"Benny Hinn is a WUSS compared to the Apostle Paul:\r\n(from 2 Cor 11) \"I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers. I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?\"","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_td06","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165161769,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"anthonydtigre","id":"ctgck","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_td06","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807637,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5018-b90e9f61-add4-4ae6-a113-ba2acb3200f2-1566236759"}

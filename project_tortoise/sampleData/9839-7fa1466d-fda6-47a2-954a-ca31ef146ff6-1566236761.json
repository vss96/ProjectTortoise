{"body":"Why do I think the article reference above isn't real? \r\neasy... it is a fantasy.\r\n\r\nThis is what Liberals (conservative has them to) think when they stuck on a train or any other place where they have a moment to just veg....\r\n\r\nIts like the old \"Hero\" daydream, you know, the one where YOU rescue all the people in the house, you get wisked to all the talkshows and get a medal from the Gov and become famous. \r\n\r\nIn this daydream, it's political heroism.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, the dialog is so absurd that is HAS to be made up.\r\nThis is on par with a Muslim telling a reporter that he has \"experienced\" bigotry when he explains that American Women routinely throw shoes at Muslim children playing outside the Mosque.\r\nThe Muslims respect issue with \"shoes\" being an insult is not shared by Americans and the likelyhood of an American throwing shoes at Muslim children is impossibly small..\r\n\r\nBasically the s ame thing here.\r\n\r\nThis person is obviously \"liberal\" and he is railing against an obvious \"conservative\" (extreme of course)\"  In this persons mind, this dialog and chain of events makes sense, but once you take a step back from your tunnelvison (we all have it) you see this is entirely made up.\r\n\r\nThe actions and dialog are not \"real\".

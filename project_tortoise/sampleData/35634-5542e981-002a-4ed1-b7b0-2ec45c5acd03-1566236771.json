Everybody makes it look like the terrorists are idiots, that 9/11 was insane, that it was pointless etc. From the perspective of the terrorists, it has worked incredibly well outside America. It just didn't have any effect inside. The media in America have always been the Government's lapdogs. Even so, no one could have imagined that the American public would have accepted \"They hate our freedom\" as an answer.\r\n\r\nOTOH, outside America, \"anti-Americanism\" has reached an all-time high. \r\n\r\nThe terrorists got at least half of what they wanted.\r\n\r\nDavid Cross: *I don't think Osama bin Laden sent those planes in to attack us because he hated our freedom. I think he did it because of our support for Israel, and our ties with the Saudi family and all our military bases in Saudi Arabia. You know why I think that? Because that's what he fucking said! Are we a nation of 6-year-olds? Answer, yes.*","link_id":"t3_v53n","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808819,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"sockpuppet","edited":false,"id":"cv7f0","parent_id":"t1_cv5n2","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35634-5542e981-002a-4ed1-b7b0-2ec45c5acd03-1566236771"}

Not usually by mathematicians, or people who have spent more than a few minutes thinking about it. ;)\r\n\r\nAlso, never trust MathWorld to use the conventions of mathematicians. Wikipedia is a little better at it, but even it has issues. PlanetMath is generally pretty good (though every once in a while it gets some crazy person uploading lots of articles with bizarre conventions to which people have to file corrections). It's okay to have your own conventions in mathematics, but it's much more work if you want to communicate with others. :)\r\n\r\nThere is no actual problem involved with defining 0^0, and lots of very good reasons to do so. The fact that x^y is discontinuous there does not provide a reason not to define it. We are quite capable of working with discontinuous functions.\r\n\r\nAlso, given that this is programming reddit, I should mention that you can pretty much guarantee that any major programming language you use, from C to Java to Ruby to Scheme to Haskell, will define 0 to the 0th power as 1. (and I even installed a Java compiler to check that!

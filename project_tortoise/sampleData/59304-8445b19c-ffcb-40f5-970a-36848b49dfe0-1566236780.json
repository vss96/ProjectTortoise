An automatic takes no time to learn. A stick takes a few days for the basics, and a few months to develop a level of proficiency. I recently read a New Yorker article on SUVs that mentioned that Americans loved SUVs despite their poor handling because (surveys showed) they felt cocooned and safe, whereas a European feels safe only a car nimble enough to maneuver out of bad situations.\r\n\r\nNow a *cop*, whose day to day business is driving skillfully in challenging situations, should be able to handle a stick. It's just basic, like literacy for a librarian. I was honestly surprised that it wasn't requirement. Given that the Bill of Rights isn't required reading, perhaps it shouldn't come as a suprise. Like I said, a skill-less society.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167523595,"ups":3,"score":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cwht9","id":"cwi0f","edited":false,"author":"anonymous-coward","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473809707,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59304-8445b19c-ffcb-40f5-970a-36848b49dfe0-1566236780"}

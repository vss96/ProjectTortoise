Liquid carbon dioxide, on the other hand, could persist much nearer the surface where temperatures can drop as low as -107C.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tv9j","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1165439938,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"gIowingsheep","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctw3a","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctw0j","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807930,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12415-136aceab-636c-45db-8f01-72ea2da66d44-1566236762"}

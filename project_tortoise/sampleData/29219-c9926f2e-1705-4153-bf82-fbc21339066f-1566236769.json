Sure.\r\n\r\nIs the minimal actually usable Java development environment simpler than the minimal actually usable Python development environment? OK, I admitted I'm not a Java coder so I guess I can't know exactly what that is, but I'm 98% certain Java can't beat the subset of emacs or vi that is necessary to edit Python. I'm pretty sure most people need an IDE, a refactoring tool, code completion, and intellisense or similar tech minimum to do real work in Java, and I'm sure some people might want even more. (AspectJ maybe?)\r\n\r\nNot to mention that since Java-the-language is too simple, _every_ last interaction with the copious libraries that Java provides is horrifically complex compared to Java. The java equivalent of:\r\n\r\n    f = file(\"localfile.txt\")\r\n    for line in f:\r\n        print line.replace(\"x\", \"y\")\r\n\r\nis a ghastly nightmare and not particularly \"simple\", considering the task. \r\n\r\n(I suppose the Python version isn't \"enterprise ready\", though, since it only required a few seconds to write. I don't how care how fast your code completion is, I beat any attempt to do that in Java.)\r\n\r\nJava may be simple. Cutting off limbs certain does result in   a simpler body. But the net impact on your life is to grossly complexify it.","link_id":"t3_utqb","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166138989,"ups":21,"score":21,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29219-c9926f2e-1705-4153-bf82-fbc21339066f-1566236769"}

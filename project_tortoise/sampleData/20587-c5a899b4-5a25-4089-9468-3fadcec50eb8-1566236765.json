It's free, and I can get many knockoffs of Windows apps and some new ones that Windows doesn't have as well. I prefer free, open standard media formats (video, sound, etc.) and so I prefer Linux. I prefer the security of Linux. And I prefer the power to \"pimp my OS\" completely the way I want to do so.\r\n\r\nIt's also cool that I don't have my OS vendor sniffing around on my workstation like you get with Windows.\r\n\r\nMy wife is also on Ubuntu and does her online banking, shopping, and email just fine. My kids do their classwork in Abiword and Gnumeric on Ubuntu, or surf the Internet to watch YouTube, play Flash-based games, or do research for school.\r\n\r\nInstalling new software or updating it is as simple as point and click.\r\n\r\nAnd with each new release of Ubuntu, it just gets better.

Is teaching children how to fake sincerity really what you want to be doing?\r\n\r\nJust because it makes everyone happy its right to teach children to lie?\r\n\r\nThese people have found a good solution. Give her cash. If the kid is so \"snot nosed\" and spoiled, fuck her. Why waste time thinking of the perfect gift when you can just give her cash? Better yet, give a donation to a charity on her behalf. Then she really looks like an asshole if she acts up about it. We should not be teaching our children to lie just to make other people feel better!

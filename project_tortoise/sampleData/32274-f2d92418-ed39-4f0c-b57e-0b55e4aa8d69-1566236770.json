Cows sleep both standing and lying down.  You learn that growing up on the farm.  They often remain standing in inclement weather.  And if you wanted to tip one, (which I have never understood),  you could use the same trick that makes rodeo cowboys look tougher than they really are during a roping competition.  You place your leg in front of their front legs and push,  and -trip- them.  I learned this when I was a fresh city kid and had tried unsuccessfully several times to use pure strength to do it.  In the process, I amused all of the old farmers, and gained a few bruises.\r\n\r\n2.  There -is- a dark side of the moon.  Or should I say dark-ER-.  No, there is no place on the moon that is always totally dark.  But the far side of the moon can be far darker than the closer one.  Why?   Because when the closer side is not directly illuminated by the Sun, it benefits from the reflected light from the Earth.  The Earth as seen from the Moon is incredibly brighter than the Moon as seen from the Earth.  When the far side is hidden from the Sun,  it is only illuminated by the stars and planets.\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uy60","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808689,"author":"ishmal","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cv0hx","parent_id":"t3_uy60","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32274-f2d92418-ed39-4f0c-b57e-0b55e4aa8d69-1566236770"}

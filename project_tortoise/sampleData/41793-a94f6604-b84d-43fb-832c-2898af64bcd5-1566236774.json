Not to put too fine a point on it, the majority of the population are paid at the end of every month, *as if on a schedule*. It may just be more convenient to have money paid into the market on that schedule.\r\n\r\nThere's another problem with the article. The lump sum investment gets a whole year in the market while the later scheduled payments get proportionately less time in the market. The fact that the random payments make a slightly bigger gain is by definition, completely by chance.\r\n\r\nAll in all, not a very thoughtful article, especially when you consider that you could run a balanced portfolio instead of a single investment and then invest in the sector which is lowest.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166649373,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvjmh","parent_id":"t3_vjcd","author_flair_text":null,"author":"css1971","retrieved_on":1473809055,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41793-a94f6604-b84d-43fb-832c-2898af64bcd5-1566236774"}

{"body":"That's a valid viewpoint.  But its more curious that whenever an incident like this occurs, there is always someone who talks about how they don't understand why people care so much, while they are \"above it all\".  This isn't directed at you specifically.  The undertone is \"these people who post messages of support are fools, why can't they see that my way of reacting is the correct one?\"  I find this attitude typical of techies.  \r\n\r\nEither you care, or don't care.  Why question how other people choose to react?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvxs","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1165441263,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"parker","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctw91","parent_id":"t1_ctw40","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807933,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12478-7ffdfbb2-15fd-4a02-a730-fefe6a133c69-1566236762"}

{"body":"&gt; Generally speaking, wanting to insert some kind of \"mutation\" into your code is a sign of leftover imperative thinking.\r\n\r\nNot entirely.\r\nThe RealWorld really is time-dependent, so any app that does nontrivial I/O has to have a top layer of effectively imperative code.\r\nThen if RealWorld mutations affect low-level code, you need to pass that info down the chain of function calls.\r\n\r\nA lot of problems are solved or avoided by FP, but there's a price for modeling the whole world as a mathematical equation.  The questions are, how hard is it, where is it worthwhile, and how can it be made easier.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w79v","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167341714,"author":"YAD","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cwajd","parent_id":"t1_cw9zs","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809568,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55587-afc58657-d047-4bdd-bd2e-e1c18c85b819-1566236779"}

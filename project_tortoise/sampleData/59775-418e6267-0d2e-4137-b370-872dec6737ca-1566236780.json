Six years later, I've clawed my way through grad school and come out the other side with a much greater appreciation for the West.  \r\n\r\nThe correlation between the Napoleonic conflicts and the World Wars doesn't really hold much water in this instance.  That sort of nationalism, vile though it was, was imperialistic.  The sort of nationalism at stake in this article is quite the opposite.  Rather than \"Sweden Uber Alles!\" it's \"Sweden: Leave Our Stuff Alone.\"  You're right that the apparatus of government isn't and shouldn't be the sole method of cultural protection.  There are a number of ways that the Swedish can assert their national pride, and violence isn't among them.  But the government itself suffers from the hopelessly PC attitude that is crippling Europe, and if things don't change soon, Sweden's women will be under burqahs.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809722,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwig9","id":"cwiuc","author":"OttoVonBismarkk","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59775-418e6267-0d2e-4137-b370-872dec6737ca-1566236780"}

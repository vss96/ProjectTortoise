A lot of reasons, but I think it boils down to people tending to stick with the status quo and not realizing there is a choice. I would bet you at least 80% (higher?) of Mac users choose to use the Mac OS over Windows. What percent of Windows users do you think make an informed decision about which OS they use? I'd put money on 30%, but I think the number is probably much lower.\r\n\r\nWhy do Mac users tend to try to get people to switch?  Macs make my life significantly better. I think most people are unhappy with their computing experience. A lot of people don't realize there are other choices. Why must you try to prove I'm wrong when I'm just trying to help someone make an informed decision? If you want to use a PC, that's great. I'm glad you like it. You're choosing to use Windows (or whatever).\r\n\r\nI'm not talking about advocates who disregard logical arguments. You should just ignore those people. There are unpleasant fanatics on both sides of this debate.  I don't see how  insulting them (or fictional strawmen) really helps the discourse. \r\n\r\nRe: OriginalSyn - Would you really let a superficial judgement about a company's commercial dictate what you buy? I usually buy products, not commercials. Sure, there is an air of superiority to the commercials. They certainly believe their Macs are better, and they want you to believe it too. I think most of it is good natured fun. I think they stand out and get your attention, which is really important.\r\n\r\nRe: The Original Image -\r\nYou could take it several ways, but the one that is least sensational (and possibly helpful) is that Mac users generally don't need to worry about how their machines work, since they (again, generally) just work. There are (generally) a lot of problems that Windows users must deal with to keep their machines running smooth.\r\n\r\nI don't like the smug look of the Mac user in the image. I think most of the time you won't see anything but sympathy and concern on a Mac user's face when he hears about someone's PC problems.\r\n\r\nI don't think you can really argue with the fact that most PC's do live in clunky beige cases and most Macs have a lot of design put into how they look.\r\n\r\nRe: Why three posts about Macs?\r\nWhy not? Why do Pro-Mac posts incite you to make Anti-Mac posts?","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167009731,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvxc1","edited":false,"id":"cvydr","author_flair_text":null,"author":"zekel","retrieved_on":1473809337,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49232-f177eed8-eee1-481d-b829-da924cf5bd81-1566236777"}

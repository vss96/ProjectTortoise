I was surprized to find that according to a hadees quoted in this book education is mendatory only for the men. The relevant Hadees seems to have been changed subsequently to include female education also in the 'Fareezah'as unlike Quran there seems to be no check on 'Tehreef' in Hadees. What your research says, dear Brig, in this respect.","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58222-4b5d5292-f146-4751-9e11-799bc8f09691-1566236780"}

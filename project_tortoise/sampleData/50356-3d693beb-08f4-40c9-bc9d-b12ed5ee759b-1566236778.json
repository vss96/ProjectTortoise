It has good documentation and community, so most questions are answered in the first Google hit. Django and web.py are in it.\r\n\r\n* I don’t hate PHP, but I do dislike it. Ditto Perl as a web langauge.\r\n\r\n* Java is verbose.\r\n\r\n* Ruby feels more like a cool hack than like a good foundation for hacks. It’s the MySQL of languages – it implements some stuff really well, but if you don’t think like the designers it feels flaky. I don’t hear the heavenly choir so many people describe when I look at Rails. (Also, its syntax is a red flag for me in the way Python’s is for some.)\r\n\r\n* I have to jump through too many hoops to get Common Lisp or one of the larger Schemes running comfortably in the same way on my OS X PPC laptop and on my Gentoo amd64 server. I’ve been very happy working on the code locally and synchronizing at test-pass with near certainty that it will work on the server exactly as it worked here. Besides, I have trouble trusting the design of any framework (or gateway or whatever) that isn’t portable. If anyone has a suggestion for a portable drop-in Apache module that runs an acceptable Lisp, or why this is the wrong thing to look for, I’d love to hear it.\r\n\r\nHoly war disclaimer: these are just my circumstances, views, and preferences. That’s what the question was.

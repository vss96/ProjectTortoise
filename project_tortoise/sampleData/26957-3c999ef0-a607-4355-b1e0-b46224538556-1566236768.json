The authoritarianism doesn't need to actualize. Semco is just one example.\r\n\r\nAnother example includes an advanced fiber plant in the local region that burned down about a decade ago, making the papers. The plant was so lucrative and the market for that kind of skilled labour was so tight, that the owner was forced to pay his workers wages just so they wouldn't leave him while the plant was being rebuilt.\r\n\r\nA privately-owned company is *legally* a feudal fief but reality may be an entirely different thing.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26957-3c999ef0-a607-4355-b1e0-b46224538556-1566236768"}

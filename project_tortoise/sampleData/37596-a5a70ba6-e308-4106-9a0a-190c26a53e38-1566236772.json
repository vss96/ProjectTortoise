You have:\r\n\r\n1. Fiscally conservative people that take out fixed-rate mortgages on homes they can afford and always pay their bills on time.  You keep these guys happy only so they'll recommend you to their group 2 friends.  You don't lose any money on these customers, but you don't make a whole lot either.\r\n2. Fiscally adventurous people that take out adjustable-rate, low-money-down, option ARM, or interest-only mortgages on big houses at the edge of their price ranges, and usually carry a balance on their credit card too.  These are where you make the big profits.  Look at it this way: if you can convince a guy to take out a 6% interest-only mortgage on a $500k house, you'll be making $30k/year from him until he sells the house, at very little risk.  His group-1 friend that takes out a 5% fixed-rate mortgage for $200k will only net you $10k/year.\r\n3. Fiscally irresponsible people who think they're in group-2 but then lose their job or get sick or have some other major financial calamity befall them.  They default.  However, to put this in perspective: if a guy takes out a $500k 6% interest-only mortgages and then defaults 7 years later, and the bank forecloses and manages to sell the house for only $300k, the bank has made a *profit* of $10k.  His interest payments more than covered the loss the bank took on the house.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v88c","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":3,"score":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166504605,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37596-a5a70ba6-e308-4106-9a0a-190c26a53e38-1566236772"}

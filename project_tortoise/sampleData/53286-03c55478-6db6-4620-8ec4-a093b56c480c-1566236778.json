{"body":"&gt;Was he really? Why do you say that?\r\n\r\nGood question.  Absent from this Reddit discussion, and having no mention on Wikipedia's entry on Ford, is Ford's support for Indonesian dictator Suharto's invasion of East Timor.\r\n\r\nFrom [this source](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB62/):\r\n\r\n&gt;Two newly declassified documents from the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, released to the National Security Archive, shed light on the Ford administration’s relationship with President Suharto of Indonesia during 1975. Of special importance is the record of Ford’s and Kissinger’s meeting with Suharto in early December 1975.  The document shows that Suharto began the invasion knowing that he had the full approval of the White House. \r\n\r\n60,000-100,000 Timorese were killed in the first year of the invasion.  Total death toll estimates run as high as 230,000.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w48y","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"created_utc":1167240709,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"adrian","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw60f","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw4ru","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809483,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53286-03c55478-6db6-4620-8ec4-a093b56c480c-1566236778"}

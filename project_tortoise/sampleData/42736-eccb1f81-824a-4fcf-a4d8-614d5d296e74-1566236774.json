Those tips work pretty well for *bullies* who are really only interested in the ego trip, but are willing to hurt someone to get it.\r\n\r\nAnyone that really wants to hurt you will welcome you standing up to them, ignore you spouting gibberish, and probably be much better than you at fighting dirty. Odds are by the time they are done you won't be able to speak, conscious, or alive to tell them it didn't hurt.\r\n\r\nIf it looks like a fight is about to start, 1. try to defuse it, 2. try to run away, 3. fight to the death. If you get to #3 expect them to kill you if they win. Yes, it sounds harsh, but bravado and fighting fair get people killed.","retrieved_on":1473809089,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvkjv","id":"cvlg1","author_flair_text":null,"author":"senzei","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42736-eccb1f81-824a-4fcf-a4d8-614d5d296e74-1566236774"}

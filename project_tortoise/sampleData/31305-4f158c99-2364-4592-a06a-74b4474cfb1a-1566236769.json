{"controversiality":0,"body":"I think the answer to that question is \"If you don't know, maybe you shouldn't change anything.\"  Thus, it gives you a choice rather than simply upgrading you.  That makes sense to me.\r\n\r\n&gt; So the question becomes: why does it break stuff? Or, more exactly, why does Sun feel the need to make sure the users are blamable for breaking stuff?\r\n\r\nWhy it breaks stuff:\r\nThe world is imperfect, and the people at Sun are serving marketing needs more than end user needs.\r\n\r\nWhy Sun feels the need to make the users blamable:\r\nI don't think that's happening at all.  Sun is just saying \"Do you want to take a chance on this upgrade?\"\r\n\r\nI think the real solution to Joel's problem is to make the notification and installation service configurable to meet the user's needs, not to make it automatically upgrade or dumb and silent.  The first time a notification of an available update pops up, there should be an option for configuring notification.  Choose that, tell it what you want to do when future notifications come up.  Simple, and not prone to pissing people off by automatically installing stuff like MS Windows, while still allowing the option of easy upgrades and notifications of new (presumably better-working) versions.\r\n\r\nedit: I disagree with your analysis of the situation (and Joel's, which seems to be getting me a lot of downvotes on my previous post), but upvoted you for asking interesting questions about the situation.  It's good to pursue the underlying pathologies of these situations.  It may not have occurred to me to bring up update configuration if I hadn't been prompted.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uv0q","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166214296,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"apotheon","parent_id":"t1_cuxjc","id":"cuyfg","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808649,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31305-4f158c99-2364-4592-a06a-74b4474cfb1a-1566236769"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Heh, you're right.  I guess my post sounded a bit too whiny.\r\n\r\nI don't think that trying to changing the current system is necessarily the best way to go, though.  I'm trying to think of ways to replace it peacefully, in parts.  For example, Lysander Spooner started his own company back in 1844 that competed with the US Post Office and drove the unreasonably high postage rates way down.  Congress eventually outlawed competition, of course, but looked very bad doing it.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling that providing people with a workable alternative will do more for anarcho-libertarianism than political activism.  But anyway, it's good to have people working on different approaches.  Here's to liberty.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uqft","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166208695,"author":"asokoloski","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cuxq1","edited":false,"id":"cuxyw","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808641,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31093-33a061a8-2c5b-41b1-a375-c51d496c2792-1566236769"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"No it doesn't. The way the Military Commissions Act is written the president is the sole authority to determine who is a terrorist. \r\n\r\nIn WWII and all previous wars we had soldiers that were fighting for a nation state. Tribunals dealt justice to soldiers who had uniforms and were clear members of a military  service of that nation. Further there were basic rights given to such soldiers by international treaty, known as the Geneva conventions.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict determination of who is a soldier is solely at the digression of out president. The composition of the judges in the tribunal is solely determined by the president who ultimately holds authority over the military. The rules for the tribunals are also ultimately determined by the president via his control over the military. \r\n\r\nSo what we have here is not a tribunal, or court established by international agreement and treaty to try to disseminate  justice internationally, what we have is an entirely parallel justice system controlled by a single man. Worse any person world wide can fall under that system of \"justice\" solely at that same man's digression. The whole military tribunal has been a danger to the constitutional foundations of our government.","link_id":"t3_trj5","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165364529,"ups":3,"score":3,"author":"smacfarl","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctrpk","parent_id":"t1_ctro1","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807849,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10281-19c2aca8-e70b-4524-ac83-eb686c6a8c77-1566236761"}

{"body":"I have to complain about the 50% column width again.  It's very irritating as it only creates a decently wide column if my browser is the right width - ie, I may be full screen, I may be in a small window.  I think a primary reason most of us nearly always have our browsers full screen is because so many sites throw away 50% of our space, and so what choice do we have?  So many of us have 1600 wide screens (mine's actuall 1920), but we don't get to use it because designers have decided a column width of 50% is best.  But, if it were 90%, and if all sites used the full screen like that, we could size our browser windows accordingly and use our screen real estate the way *we* wanted.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tjeu","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1165325412,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctmor","id":"ctot1","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807795,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8830-829e1022-3631-4136-9d13-8773b5b5ded8-1566236760"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Ah, exactly!  But once the monopoly government is gone, anyone who tries to exert power has to pay for it *himself*.  The reason lobbying is so lucrative is you can spend $10,000 to get $1,000,000 worth of protectionist laws, tax breaks, or whatnot.  That leverage disappears when there is no lawmaker with control over vast sums of other people's money.\r\n\r\n&gt; For the latter, government is their only source of power, the only large institution with the potential to serve their interests.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't matter, because government is HUGE.  It's a power amplifier, and the fact that there's only one source of power isn't good, it's bad.  That means it's a good bit harder for any of us to keep it in check, or escape it.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tocn","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":1,"score":1,"created_utc":1165776424,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"asokoloski","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cucf4","parent_id":"t1_ctq75","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808236,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20477-b3cffc85-adcb-4995-b73f-6a835c7cfbe8-1566236765"}

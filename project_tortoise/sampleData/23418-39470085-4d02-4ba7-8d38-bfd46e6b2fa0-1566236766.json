{"body":"**chucker** is probably referring to the signature style of Apple icons from the last few years.  Namely, a metal disk pedestal  with a sculpted glass-ish 3D symbol resting on top.  You can see a couple of examples on these pages:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/server/macosx/leopard/\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/server/macosx/xgrid.html\r\n\r\nIronically, those pages make it look like Apple is moving away from that style of icon.  I'll bet it's a style associated with a certain type of component, though.  Perhaps a service or something gets that kind of icon.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ugs5","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":12,"ups":12,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165876667,"author":"neolefty","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuhrw","id":"cuhtq","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808340,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23418-39470085-4d02-4ba7-8d38-bfd46e6b2fa0-1566236766"}

{"body":"&gt; What's the justification for the special syntax?\r\n\r\nLooking at the example given by pjdelport:\r\n\r\n    def foo(...):\r\n        ...\r\n    foo = decorate(foo)\r\n\r\nvs.\r\n\r\n    @decorate\r\n    def foo(...):\r\n         ...\r\n\r\nThe latter is more useful to the programmer reading someone else's code, because the decorating function is referenced close to the function declaration. So if the \"...\" is of significant length, you don't have to scroll around to see what `foo()` actually ends up being.\r\n\r\nIt's sugar. Sugar specifically designed to be helpful for people reading other people's code. Given that's one of Python's core values (a teaching language, code resembling pseudocode, etc), it's not surprising to me that they went this route.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_to4r","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165380999,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jmelesky","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctood","id":"ctsm3","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807867,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10786-278604a3-e862-41e5-9df7-05fb91386d0d-1566236761"}

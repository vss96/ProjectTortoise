It's a decent read, and it makes a similar case to Graham's: essentially, in what the authors call \"winner-take-all\" markets, very small differences in ability or performance translate into huge differences in renumeration. (Another way to look at this would be to express income in a zipf distribution, but I digress...)\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm not arguing that there should be no difference in wealth between the richest and the poorest. The world will never work that way. When I dropped out of university, I was dirt poor and worked a succession of shitty jobs for little money. \r\n\r\nI don't begrudge it in the least; it was a good learning experience for me, and I discovered that there are other goals in life than a higher income or net wealth; goals to which I'd rather aspire (that and wasting time on reddit ;).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I don't have a problem with someone being paid well for doing valuable work. The problem is not that some people have more money, *but that the skew is so exponential*.\r\n\r\nPaul Graham is a bright guy, and he successfully made plenty of money by seeing a burgeoning need, sidestepping transient techno-fashion, and creating an enduring product that none of its competitors could touch. More power to him.\r\n\r\nHowever, his model of the economy - as a heady brew of entrepreneurs, hackers, and investors seething to create the next big thing - is not widely applicable. Most people are not hackers, never will be hackers, and do not need to be hackers. There's a simple reason for this: most of the work that needs to be done in the world is not hacking.\r\n\r\nGraham idolizes the Silicon Valley culture of innovation and risk-taking, but neglects to point out that across the valley, immigrant workers are struggling to keep their heads above water, making minimum wage (or less) to assemble the physical components on which he builds his valuable software. \r\n\r\nWhat promise does hacking and entrepreneurship hold for those people? For most, I'd say none at all. What they need is decent public transportation, good public schools, access to health care, the ability to take a day off work to care for a sick child without being laid off, and an income that is adequate to meet their monthly needs. \r\n\r\nThe Winner-Take-All society in which we live has very little left over for those 98 percent of people who are not winners; and it drops off exponentially as we move down the percentiles. Writing about executive renumeration, Graham writes, \"I have no trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive as another.\" \r\n\r\nHowever, the system of accountability for executives is [anything but objective and transparent](http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewPrint&amp;articleId=6580). The avarice and cronyism of these celebrity executives amidst falling wages and outsourcing drains real wealth out of the economy. It discounts Graham's claim that in today's economy, the extremely wealthy are no longer stealing it.\r\n\r\nThe extreme and steadily increasing disparity in wealth is not an inevitable outcome of market forces. Many countries, using a judicious mix of market, tax, and regulatory incentives and disincentives, have managed to create economies that produce plenty of wealth, support a wealthy overclass, and still have enough wealth left over to maintain decent, humane minimum standards for everyone else - which, perhaps counterintuitively, actually increases overall productivity growth since well fed, well educated, healthy people tend to be better thinkers and workers. I'm thinking specifically of countries like [Switzerland, Finland, and Sweden](http://www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/gcp/Global%20Competitiveness%20Report/index.htm), which have managed to do this without producing a culture of dependency and entitlement.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807825,"gilded":0,"id":"ctqea","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctq6t","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9566-4e733754-4b04-4fda-be59-b9f946af6ab3-1566236761"}

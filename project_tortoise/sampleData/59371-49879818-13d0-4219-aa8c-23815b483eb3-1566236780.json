{"controversiality":0,"body":"Police Officers are typically trained in Crown Vics. They factory tuned automatic transmissions because police officers MIGHT actually need a free hand in a high speed pursuit -- to operate a siren or talk over the radio to other officers.\r\n\r\nNewer police cars are actually based off a police-interceptor version of the Dodge Charger. It has AWD. The kind of drifting and drafting that police officers learn to do at 70 and 80 mph in a crown vic can't be done in a AWD vehicle. A lot of police departments are having to send their officers back to driving school for them to learn how exactly to handle a AWD vehicle in a high speed pursuit.\r\n\r\n(And yes, it does take training to successfully not kill yourself and/or others when you're trying to do a 90 degree turn at 80+ mph on a wet two lane street.)\r\n\r\nSo as police vehicles haven't been stick since the 50s or 60s, why would it be a required job skill?","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wgpl","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167525777,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"redrobot5050","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwi0l","id":"cwi4c","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809708,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59371-49879818-13d0-4219-aa8c-23815b483eb3-1566236780"}

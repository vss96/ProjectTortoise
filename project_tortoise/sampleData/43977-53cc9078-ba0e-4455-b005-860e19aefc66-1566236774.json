The supposed claim that using a cell phone during flight could endanger the plane *MUST* be utter and complete nonsense -- aka a lie. There is no valid reason related to plane safety why we cannot use our cell phones on a plane. My reasoning? Simple, any terrorist would have only to use their cell phone in an attempt to bring down a plane if it were really a danger -- and no measure of security even remotely considers this as an option. I find it hillarious that there is any conception that a passenger's behavior on a plane while he or she remains in his or her seat could possibly endanger the plane.","created_utc":1166730240,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43977-53cc9078-ba0e-4455-b005-860e19aefc66-1566236774"}

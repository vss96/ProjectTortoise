Since this delivers the dose in a few seconds, it has more potential for harm.\r\n\r\nAlso with TSA redundancy, how many times will you have to get scanned to get on a plane?  And what if there are plane changes?  And what if you fly frequently?  It all adds up.\r\n\r\nAccording to\r\nhttp://www.rapiscansystems.com/sec1000.html\r\n\r\nIt's less than 10 microREM per scan.  (On another page it says 3, which to me says they aren't estimating very closely.)  Let's assume it's 10 uR (micro-REM) for ease of calculation.  Let's assume it takes 10 seconds per scan; your exposure is 1 uR per second.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, your exposure, according to their numbers, being indoors: \"up to\" 25 uR/day or .0003 uR/sec\r\n\r\nOne plane flight: \"up to\" 500 uR/hour or 0.14 uR/sec\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t8vc","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2306-443da4b0-d938-4955-b95f-03df77a23dfa-1566236758"}

Also, if you find out the bug might be in the Python interpreter, you will need the system debugger anyway. There is no clean way to bridge the debugging gap between the OS and the higher-level language. \r\n\r\nAs for the GIL and the compilation question, I was hoping you would go one step further in your asking \"Why?\", instead of dismissing the question with a \"oh, well, it doesn't matter\"; Python has a GIL because the OS won't preserve interpreter invariants when interrupting and scheduling threads. C doesn't need a GIL, because the OS is sufficiently kind as to not disrupt the C runtime. \r\n\r\nThis kind of seamless ideal is why Lispers pine for the Lisp machines: every object in the OS was understood to Lisp and vice-versa; Lisp and the OS used the same primitives, and the interrupt and OS scheduling machinery respected Lisp's needs.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165381503,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"ctsmq","parent_id":"t1_ctrro","author_flair_text":null,"author":"sickofthisshit","retrieved_on":1473807867,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10796-e746b04a-6ca4-4417-96bc-1b5145e4cb8e-1566236761"}

Reddit hasn't solved all those problems, but it's solved most of them.\r\n\r\nMy big complaint about Digg is that it's more an example of network effects than wisdom of the crowds. The site is designed such that are encouraged to Digg articles which are already popular. It also built out social networking features which encourage Digging what your friends are Digging. The number of Diggs is displayed as this huge number, and psychologically we see a big number and think \"popularity=good\". The result is more mob rule than democracy.\r\n\r\nThe commenting system is whack as it doesn't allow for true threading - you can downmod trolls, but you can't reply directly to the person above the troll and fork the conversation.\r\n\r\nThe front page itself is a mess - the stories are organized by the order they got to the front page, it doesn't even attempt to rank them by importance (which makes it pretty valueless as a real news site).\r\n\r\nReddit's not perfect, but it avoided a lot of the above pitfalls. That's why I think Reddit is better.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807990,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctz8i","parent_id":"t3_tvsi","edited":false,"author":"ejp1082","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13716-c36d8e6c-926f-4661-8241-7375bcd51539-1566236762"}

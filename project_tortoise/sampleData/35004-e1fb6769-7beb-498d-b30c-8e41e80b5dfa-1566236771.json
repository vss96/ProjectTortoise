They then trashed his car by pulling up the carpet and weather stripping while \"searching\" it.\r\n\r\nTheir \"probable cause\" was that he talked funny (he is profoundly deaf and has a speech impediment).\r\n\r\nThe ironic thing is that he is about the most straight up person I know and he would never do anything illegal.\r\n\r\nUpon my advice, he went to the ACLU to see what could be done (I had him write down all the details, including badge numbers, within an hour of it happening).  The ACLU said they were not interested in the case as that sort of thing \"happens all the time\" (remember, this was the late 1980s and things have gotten much worse since then).","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166410982,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cv63a","parent_id":"t1_cv4so","author_flair_text":null,"author":"keylime","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808795,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35004-e1fb6769-7beb-498d-b30c-8e41e80b5dfa-1566236771"}

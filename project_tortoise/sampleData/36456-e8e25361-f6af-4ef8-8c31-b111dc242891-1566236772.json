It describes the torments of hell...\r\n\r\nI don't believe that the torment of absence of God is within our human understanding. Enter metaphor.\r\n\r\n&gt;...it says clearly who will go there and who wont.\r\n\r\nAgain, I have already said this.\r\n\r\n&gt;Except that christ is no longer on the cross and he is in heaven.\r\n\r\nParaphrase: Person A is planning to kill Person B. Person C offers to be killed in Person B's place. Person B is killed before Person C would have been.\r\n\r\n&gt;Un fucking believable that a person in this and age would come out and admit that they believe such an absurd thing.\r\n\r\nSeriously? You find it unbelievable someone would profess to being a Christian? You may find Christianity unbelievable but there's hard evidence that people would profess to being a Christian.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v6h2","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808852,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Odd_Bloke","edited":false,"id":"cv94v","parent_id":"t1_cv78o","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36456-e8e25361-f6af-4ef8-8c31-b111dc242891-1566236772"}

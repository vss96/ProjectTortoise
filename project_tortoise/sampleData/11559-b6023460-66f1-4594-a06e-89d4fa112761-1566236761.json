That's not \"so organized,\" that's just [the easiest way to use spamgourmet](http://www.spamgourmet.com/).\r\n\r\nI wonder, actually, what prevents spammers from turning the basic spamgourmet setup against its users. Once you know the \"myName@xoxy.net\" part and the rules, you could send 10 spams to \"aaaa.10.myName@xoxy.net,\" 20 spams to \"aaab.20.myName@xoxy.net,\" etc. Spamgourmet will dutifully forward the messages along to your protected mailbox. Maybe spamgourmet isn't popular enough to attract this sort of attention yet.\r\n\r\nSpamgourmet has an \"advanced mode\" that includes a watchword system, giving you some some control over the creation of new disposable addresses, but it does make using the system quite a bit trickier.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11559-b6023460-66f1-4594-a06e-89d4fa112761-1566236761"}

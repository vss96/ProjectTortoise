The TV itself is not evil.   However much of what is on is.   (I'll let you decide on the definition of evil)\r\n\r\nA TV can be used to for time lapse photography - a good educational way to see plants grow.   Or you can use it to get your yearly dose of 1000 murders, 100 sex acts, 10000 nearly nude bodies, 20000 acts of domestic violence, and 1500 arguments that hard drugs are something you want to take.

However the point is how you use/abuse it.    \r\n\r\nMostly TV is a time waster.   There are better things to do with your time.

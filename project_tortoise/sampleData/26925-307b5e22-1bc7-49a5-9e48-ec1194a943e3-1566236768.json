{"body":"&gt; Bill Gates doesn't say to get rich working in software like he did\r\n\r\nHeh.  He doesn't like competition, but he most definitely DID say \"get rich working at Microsoft\", that's what their pitch has been for years and years now.  Stock options.\r\n\r\n&gt; and being five years ahead of the rest of your competitors (which he was\r\n\r\nApparently you are unfamiliar with the history of Microsoft.  They tended to be five years *behind*, which is where all the product pre-announcement strategies came from.  I would say their monopoly was a drag on the industry for 15 to 20 years.  Use a new 24\" iMac and you realize it's polished but it's the same thing NeXT at the end of the 80's, finally backed by a big enough company to get it onto people's desktops.  Monopolies crowd out innovative stuff like that.\r\n\r\n&gt; Which is true. \r\n\r\nIn dollars.  But \"value\" is hard to measure, and we aren't objective about it.  People value their own single child more than everyone else's children put together, usually.\r\n\r\n&gt; but if you're going to say \"Money is a bad measurement of achievement,\" you ought to suggest a better standard.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple standards that can work.  Because there is no such thing as one single quantifier for value; you can imagine rather a \"value profile\" ranked in a dozen or more categories, much like an IQ test.  A person with an IQ of 100 might actually score extremely high in some categories but woefully in others, averaging to 100; but in those high categories they will run circles around people who are 100 across-the-board.\r\n\r\n&gt; Why are you positing some relationship between maximum use for the ideal customer and total worth to all customers? Does this have any grounding in theory or fact, or did you make it up to bolster your argument?\r\n\r\nI don't understand what you're asking.  Right before that you said the comparison was \"true\".  I don't think I argued anything other than \"value is hard to measure\".  What I did mention was marketing, where a widget that could be hugely useful is less \"valuable\" because it doesn't get into the hands of as many people.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_unoz","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166047179,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lemmikins","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuoux","id":"cup6x","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808477,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26925-307b5e22-1bc7-49a5-9e48-ec1194a943e3-1566236768"}

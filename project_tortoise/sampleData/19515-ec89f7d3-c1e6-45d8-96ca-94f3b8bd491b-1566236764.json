Our bodies need the exact kind of gravity. I also don't have proof on the human body's reliance on Earth's magnetic core, but I would reason to bet that our bodies need to \"recharge\" with this as well.\r\n\r\nGenetically, I would think our genes would get messed up in environments besides Earth, from a weaker gravity perspective or from perhaps something else we haven't analyzed yet. We would likely die off or catch terrible diseases.\r\n\r\nI think sending people into outer space is too expensive and offers too little reward.

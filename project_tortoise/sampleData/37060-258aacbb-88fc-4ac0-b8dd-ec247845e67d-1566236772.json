As for Carter, when you paint with a broad brush all you make is a sloppy picture.  Please cite the sources for your position that every Democrat in office has condemned his book.\r\n\r\n&gt;I like how it's all my fault palestenians are being tortured. No it's not the fault of the torturers at all. It's my fault.\r\n\r\nYou are either very dishonest or a very poor reader.  Nowhere did I say it was all your fault that Palestinians are being tortured.  I only said that in perpetuating a false and divisive position you are empowering those who are responsible for the Palestinian situation. \r\n\r\n&gt;As I said. Israel is a democracy. People who believe like you are in the minority. The majority (an overwhelming majority) are in favor of apartheid and applaud and cheer when arabs are killed.\r\n\r\nThat's irrelevant.  I agreed that the majority were in the wrong.  What I was saying (which you never really addressed) was that your 1-2% number was made up and that blaming every Jew because too many are hawks is not justified.","ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1166483980,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37060-258aacbb-88fc-4ac0-b8dd-ec247845e67d-1566236772"}

I have a boss who knows a decent amount of tech, a lot about business, and who listens to the developers. In return, I only bring him tech that I can stand behind. \r\n\r\n&gt; This is mostly a community of people who love programming even when they're not being paid for it, and they don't like it when people say that since some PHB won't sign off on X, X is worthless.\r\n\r\nI'm not expecting that they would like it, but look at it from my perspective. I'm a software developer, I love making peoples life easier through software. For people like me, programming languages are tools, means to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_t1cf","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":-4,"ups":-4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164951321,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"642-868ca611-f9f7-4568-ba3e-29bbd912aaf2-1566236758"}

Obviously he isn't like by the USA, but that is probably because his politics run contrary to the efforts the US has made in Latin America over the past 50 years. Which brings us back to why he is important, he is leading a quite revolution against the traditional politics of latin America, politics which the US has had a very heavy hand in creating. Agreement with his politics (or is seemingly childish use of insults, but I don't know his culture so I won't judge this), this is up for each person to decide. But his importance in current global politics can not be ignored.","created_utc":1166717696,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vmcp","edited":false,"id":"cvn0r","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Draracle","retrieved_on":1473809120,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43387-37dde058-79e5-4522-b288-cf56f0fab37a-1566236774"}

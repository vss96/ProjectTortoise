I can't think of a single good reason to grant more weight to the opinion of people who have been disastrously wrong in the past and only revised their thinking after overwhelming evidence at enormous cost. Admitting error puts you a cut above those who blindly hold to obviously wrong judgments, but it doesn't make you an authority.\r\n\r\nThere were people who very accurately predicted how the Iraq debacle would shape up.  Their opinions and advice are not being solicited by anyone in power, despite their demonstrated ability to understand and predict the consequences of our actions in the region.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16589-54bf599e-42fd-4746-a59a-28506ff3ed9f-1566236763"}

We have an emerging IT sector and the local government support agencies are doing what they can. The major problem we face is the industrial heritage, that created a bit of a dependency upon large organisations to provide us all with work. That has all gone now, but the heritage remains.\r\n\r\nI must admit to being trained as a psychologist and my core position on this one is that we must make the best of the environmental conditions we find ourselves within.\r\n\r\nThe really successful entrepreneurs in this region have done it themselves, and driven their businesses forward. It would be great to have the networks, resources and recent history of Silicon Valley, or even Boston. In the UK the only area that seems to get anywhere near is Cambridge, but the North East is a great place to give it a go, and I find the energy of those who have to work against the odds to succeed is quite exciting.\r\nDavid","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165952275,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25445-6e09d4e5-779b-4b07-93c4-786ec49c5d08-1566236767"}

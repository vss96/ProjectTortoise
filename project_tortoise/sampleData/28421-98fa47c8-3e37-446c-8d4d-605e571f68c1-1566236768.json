(I think most people would suggest the problem is an unconscious bias rather than an orchestrated campaign of outright racism.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, maybe Mr. Medved is suggesting that underrepresented races have fewer people qualified in terms of \"education level, physical fitness, scientific background, leadership ability, [and] raw intelligence\".  But most people would see that as a blatantly racist statement, which is why Mr. Medved was too much of a pussy to come right out and say it.\r\n","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166120162,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cusid","parent_id":"t3_us2a","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"IvyMike","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808538,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28421-98fa47c8-3e37-446c-8d4d-605e571f68c1-1566236768"}

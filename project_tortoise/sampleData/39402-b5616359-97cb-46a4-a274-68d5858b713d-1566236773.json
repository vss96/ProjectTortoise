The usual visual aid is a balloon with some dots drawn on it. When the balloon is inflated, the dots get farther apart, even though they haven't actually moved on the balloon.\r\n\r\n_Edited to add:_ I should probably mention that in the example above, the \"space\" which appears to be expanding is the 2-dimensional surface of the balloon. Even if you lived completely inside that surface, and were oblivious to the 3-dimensional space around it, you would still see things \"expanding\". To you it wouldn't look like an expanding balloon, it would just look like your neighbours getting further away.\r\n\r\nOne of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang is that it paints a picture of the universe exploding outward into something. A more accurate picture is to imagine that you start off in a very crowded space, and suddenly everything is moving away from you rapidly. There is no viewpoint from \"outside\" the explosion, because it is space itself which is exploding outward.","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166564648,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cveyg","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvdio","author":"crwper","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808963,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39402-b5616359-97cb-46a4-a274-68d5858b713d-1566236773"}

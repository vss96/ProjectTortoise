If you substitute roommate -&gt; flatmate, it works out.  It's not uncommon to have co-ed suites in American college dorms.\r\n\r\nCuriously though, \"floorcest\" and \"suitecest\" seem vaguely taboo.  They certainly happen, but many of my classmates thought it bad karma to sleep with a hallmate or suitemate, because then it gets all awkward afterwards and you have to live with this person for the rest of the year.  Far more common was the \"walk of shame\", where you would find a random drunk freshman girl, have her sleep over, and then she'd be walking home the next morning.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vh1r","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809058,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvjt7","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvi4v","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41913-51ef6875-d383-4938-bde9-12a20ac5553b-1566236774"}

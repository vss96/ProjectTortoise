Working in the field of mobile services for smart phones I can only agree with the description of fragmentation, inconsistency and lost opportunities. Most people I meet complain about the lack of good devices, bad user interfaces, boring services etc. With just a basic attention to all the details involved, mobile devices and services could be way better that today's lousy standards.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uk2v","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165925683,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24584-f90bce85-e460-431b-a8d2-a3ab8c44e922-1566236767"}

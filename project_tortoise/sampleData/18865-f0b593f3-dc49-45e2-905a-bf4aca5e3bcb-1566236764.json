Volunteers do every ounce of work possible, but the reality is that you do need staff people.\r\n\r\n2) Why so you assume that I take more money than I need? I have a college degree and I only make just over $10/hour (and that's when I get paid)- there are people who have no High School education and work at McDonalds that make more money than me. There are people who are a lot worse of than I am- I'm not starving and I have a warm place to live, I even have a beater of a car- but I am not rich by any stretch of the imagination- I live below the official poverty line of our country (although I still would not consider myself impoverished). \r\n\r\n3) I'm not a full-time staff member. I'm part-time. I get paid for 20/hours per week, but in reality do 30+. I volunteered for three years before I went on staff, and the only reason I am on staff is because I believe in the work we do and staff allows me to spend more time doing something worthwhile and less time at a Micky Mouse job doing something that doesn't matter but pays my family's rent.\r\n\r\n4) My donors know a hell of a lot more about what I do with their money than you do, and still see the charity as worthwhile of supporting, and they get regular reports which show them how every cent of their money is being spent.\r\n\r\nTo Pellegrino: the people we work with are teenagers- they are vulnerable. For their safety, our volunteers do need some oversight. The teenagers we work with need someone collecting police background checks and looking into references and establishing boundaries. In our jurisdiction, law dictates that this has to be a staff person and not a volunteer. If we didn't have staff doing this, we could not do charity.\r\n\r\nAs well, staff is important for volunteers. They need someone to train them and offer resources to them. And they need someone who is available- a staff person is always more available time wise than is a volunteer. As I said, I was a volunteer with us for 3 years, and I couldn't have done it without the support of staff.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u89o","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18865-f0b593f3-dc49-45e2-905a-bf4aca5e3bcb-1566236764"}

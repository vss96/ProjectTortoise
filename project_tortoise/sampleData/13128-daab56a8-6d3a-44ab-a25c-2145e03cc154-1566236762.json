The shapes match observed crystal mold shapes on mars, and NASA was quite interested - they flew him down to give a presentation on the work. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I saw his talk on it, and it was very neat - the whole experiment cost less than 100$ if I recall.\r\n\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807961,"gilded":0,"id":"ctxpz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tv9j","author":"Random","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13128-daab56a8-6d3a-44ab-a25c-2145e03cc154-1566236762"}

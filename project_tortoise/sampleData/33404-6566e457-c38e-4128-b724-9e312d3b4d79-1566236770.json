The Germans didn't have much of a surface Navy, nor did they have much in the way of torpedo bombers, and their pilots were not trained to sink ships due to some political bullshit between the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine.  Just look at what a terrible job the Luftwaffe did sinking ships during the evacuation of Dunkirk for evidence.\r\n\r\nThe Germans would have probably ended up up the bottom of the English channel, or at best trapped without supplies in England.\r\n\r\nGetting air superiority actually wouldn't have been a such a big problem.  If they had gone ahead with Sealion, and committed everything, they could have taken out whatever the RAF would have been willing to commit.  But it doesn't do any good without naval power.","score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166332625,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33404-6566e457-c38e-4128-b724-9e312d3b4d79-1566236770"}

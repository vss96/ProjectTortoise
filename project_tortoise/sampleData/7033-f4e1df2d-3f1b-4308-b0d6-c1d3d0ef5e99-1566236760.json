Female mutiliation is an ancient custom to preven women from having an interest and hopefully not, engaging in sex.  I need to check on this, but I believe this is done to married woman also.  Sex for a married woman is not supposed to be enjoyable.  This is the method utilized to stop adultery on the part of woman.  Of course, stoning to death is also used and even reporting your own rape will get you 100 lashes or the death sentence.\r\n\r\nThe men, on the other hand, are usually left unpunished since it is always the fault of the woman that she had sex or was raped.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tk48","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165255654,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7033-f4e1df2d-3f1b-4308-b0d6-c1d3d0ef5e99-1566236760"}

The \"how do I make a self-contained executable\" is a symptom of this expectation. \"The first thing I did when I learned C was 'gcc hello-world.c -o hello; ./hello', so that's the first thing I'm going to do in Lisp.\" \"\r\n\r\nVery lucid. Thanks. If this is indeed, what Rainer was trying to say, (and if the context was that someone wanted lisp to behave exactly like C) then this article (finally) makes sense to me.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tksn","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807907,"author":"plinkplonk","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cturt","parent_id":"t1_ctueg","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11748-6626ff24-f1c2-4889-a457-9537d7ccb023-1566236761"}

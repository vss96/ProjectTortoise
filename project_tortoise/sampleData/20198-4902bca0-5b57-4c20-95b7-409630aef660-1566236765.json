Grab a sockets library that lets you use the iostream stuff over the network and Robert's your Dad's brother.\r\n\r\n\"Now me, I never met a C/SDL implementation I got along with and then there's the Java and RMI boys. Misguided, if you takes my meaning Sir.\r\n\r\n\"There's some fly-boys talking about Erlang on this switch thing-a-me-bob. Pretty whizzy if you ask me. They compare apples and oranges with that CORBA lame duck, but you can't blame them for that.\r\n\r\n\"For my money, I don't know. So long as you're not asking me to program ticket collection for an AXE-10 we should get along grandly.\" He shuffled his feet and then took a drag on his cigarette.\r\n\r\nAfter a short blissful look passed his over his face he eyed the still smoldering stub critically and snuffed it between finger and thumb, then put it behind his ear. From somewhere a notebook and pencil appeared. He licked the end of his pencil before fixing me with one eye.\r\n\r\n\"So, what'll be? The fancy schmancy Erlang fly boy solution, or the C++? I promise you, my men don't do CORBA. The last who tried choked on it and we had to put him in hospital for a week.

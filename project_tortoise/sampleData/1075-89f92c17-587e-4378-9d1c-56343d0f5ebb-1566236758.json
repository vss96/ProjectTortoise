{"body":"Actually the link you supplied says\r\n\r\n&gt; Most jurisdictions in the United States have abolished the doctrine [of Contributory Negligence] altogether.\r\n\r\nINAL but I wouldn't think you could use that defence in this case anyway.  Would you expect a shoplifter to be able to claim 'contributory negligence' because the shopkeepeer didn't chain everything down?\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, contributory negligence is about being just that - negligent.  Failing to stop people stealing from you isn't negligent unless you virtually invite them to do it.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t672","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":4,"score":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164979222,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"muttleee","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct741","id":"ct7y9","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807479,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1075-89f92c17-587e-4378-9d1c-56343d0f5ebb-1566236758"}

A simple example:\r\n&gt; `SELECT *,(sales_tax_rate * total) as sales_tax, (SELECT max(transaction_date) FROM transactions WHERE order_id=o.id) as last_transaction_date FROM orders o ORDER BY last_transaction_date LIMIT 20;`\r\n\r\nOne thing that i've found in my career is that very few developers, no matter their level of experience, have any idea the degree to which you can make \"complex calculations\" in SQL.\r\n\r\nThis example is a simple parent-child query.\r\n\r\nI feel like i'm going to be accused of old-fogey-ness, but is it unreasonable to expect developers to be able to string together a twenty or thirty line SQL query together? I've worked with reports that were routinely in the 1500 lines of SQL range, hitting dozens of tables, with multiple nested queries, and i know that i haven't even hit the limits of SQL's expressive capacity (for example, i know that i haven't needed to use recursive queries).\r\n\r\nIs SQL really so hard? Are people so used to MySQL that they don't realize complicated queries are possible? Doesn't anybody need to run any kind of serious analytic report?

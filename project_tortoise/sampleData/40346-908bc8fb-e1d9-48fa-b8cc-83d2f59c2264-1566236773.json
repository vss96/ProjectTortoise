The Thailand exchange has already rebounded 9% it was a bump.  One thing that happens to stocks alot today is like what happened to YHOO or AMZN (check on jul24 to now on AMZN) from may-july, software sets trailing stops for people at 15-20% below the stock price, once it breaches that stocks can have a 20% drop in one day, they quickly retrace though and its actually a great time to buy.\r\n\r\ndisclaimer: invest at your own risk","retrieved_on":1473808994,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvgkq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cve8u","author_flair_text":null,"author":"drawkbox","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40346-908bc8fb-e1d9-48fa-b8cc-83d2f59c2264-1566236773"}

It's much easier to maintain 5 lines that took 20 minutes upfront than 20 lines that took 10 lines up front.\r\n\r\nThis is probably why many productivity studies have found that programmers - across all languages and the middle of the bell curve in programmer skill - are roughly equal in productivity when measured in *lines per hour*, but certain tools or programmers can solve the same problem in many fewer *total lines*.  I dunno about you, but most of my professional experience has been in figuring out why things don't work.  The fewer things that can go wrong, the less time I spend.  Unless the program has been obscured beyond all rationality (I'm looking at you, Perl), fewer lines = fewer things that can go wrong.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uzuc","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808716,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nostrademons","id":"cv1wx","parent_id":"t1_cv1ss","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32792-0a903494-b1a8-46ee-b29d-b088b76f3043-1566236770"}

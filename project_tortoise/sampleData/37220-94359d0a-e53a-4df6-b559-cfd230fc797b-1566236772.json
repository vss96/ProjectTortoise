At least according to what I've read/have been told, the big bang and evolution are scientific, so I would simply dismiss him.  It's no big thing; I'm just there for the diploma.  I get most of my knowledge at home.\r\n\r\n&gt;How about if they were teaching this to your son or daughter?\r\n\r\nAgain, no.  I would simply tell them that I disagree with the teacher, but I wouldn't be particularly upset.  Sometimes, you get good teachers in school; other times you get bad ones.","link_id":"t3_v6h2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166489373,"score":0,"ups":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37220-94359d0a-e53a-4df6-b559-cfd230fc797b-1566236772"}

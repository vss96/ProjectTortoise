They don't question unless they are taught how to, and in a world like today I strongly feel that people are ceasing to care and are no longer willing to ask questions.\r\n\r\nIf you give God as an answer to every question a child has, as would occur in a Christian home then of course they're going to grow up to be god-fearing adults.\r\n\r\nBut my point ultimately is that a child only recognises the dangers they are taught to recognise. If you never taught road safety how many more children do you think would be hit by cars? I consider the close-mindedness that comes of this sort of raising to be a danger in society. That is a child who chooses to be christian is of greater value to both the world society and christianity itself, then one who is born and bred christian.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808285,"gilded":0,"id":"cueyj","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cubib","author":"Grim_Chook","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21952-8e104a14-476c-4f27-a460-4972f94c0b00-1566236766"}

Because if you're trying to shock me with news that 90% of people had sex in the 60's and 70's, well, I already knew that.  I think most people who claim purity past are thinking of adults in the 50s, ie born in the 30s.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't matter anyway.  Even if this study found that premarital sex rates had skyrocketed since the 70s, that doesn't make premarital sex right or wrong.  The people preaching abstinence would still preach abstinence, and the people preaching free love would still preach free love.","link_id":"t3_vg5m","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809017,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"plexluthor","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vg5m","id":"cvhqn","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40827-01f8b0a9-1e85-4f47-8cd8-4be46f3f478e-1566236773"}

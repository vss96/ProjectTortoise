And in the light of the recent discovery of the QM with all those strange results, it's understandable that people got a little bit wacky at that time. Even physicists. We're talking about the beginning of the last century here, please try to put yourself in the position of those guys.\r\n\r\nAnd I already wrote that I accept the reality of the wave function. Have you read, what I wrote?\r\n\r\nNow you say I have to accept:\r\n\r\n- decoherence: No problem with it, its a physical plausible process.\r\n\r\n- entanglement. Also no problem and validated in lots of experiments. A theory without would have lots of problems to explain those experiments. And since we're talking about reality here, those experiments are the reality.\r\n\r\n- many-worlds, many-histories. IMO nonsense. Its just a result of misinterpretation: If someone wants to take the wave function serious *and* continue to hang on the concept of particles, *then* he need to pull silly concepts like 'many worlds' or 'Copenhagen' out of his ass. If not, it's not necessary and QM suddenly becomes much more down-to-earth (and even deterministic again).\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809215,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvryb","parent_id":"t1_cvrcq","author":"kawa","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45956-1cc56ed9-5b4c-4d1b-8907-deaa0673307c-1566236775"}

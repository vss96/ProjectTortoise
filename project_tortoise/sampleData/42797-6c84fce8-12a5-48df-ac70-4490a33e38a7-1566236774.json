{"controversiality":0,"body":"I honor your enthusiasm for aikido, but take a step back and think about that \"disarm and completely control your opponent without violence and without hurting them\" statement. If you use aikido effectively on someone who is untrained and unprepared, there's a good chance you're going to cause real damage. \r\n\r\nIn aikido, people practice falling safely and reacting to joint locks. This allows practice to approach real-life speed and intensity while minimizing the risk of serious injury. Think. When an aikido practitioner gets thrown, he rolls. Take that technique off a mat and apply it to someone who doesn't know it's coming and doesn't know how to fall, and they'll likely land on their head and crumple.\r\n\r\nIn aikido, you can practice deadly techniques at near full speed in a safe setting. You also have a mindset that is not all about destruction, and that helps too. But that idea that you can totally control someone without doing any damage...you'd have to be really, really, really good.","link_id":"t3_vjjh","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166686141,"score":8,"ups":8,"author":"ewokjedi","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvktf","edited":false,"id":"cvlk8","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809092,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42797-6c84fce8-12a5-48df-ac70-4490a33e38a7-1566236774"}

So it's natural for them to court the west.  As for forming their own union among Turkic people, that's a great idea, but of course the benefits aren't comparable to being part of the EU.\r\n\r\nI think they should continue to fight for inclusion in the EU, while continuing to increase their alliance with other muslim states.  The did note that trade increased from 3% to 30% so they do seem to be going in that direction.\r\n\r\nWhat was also of interest to me was the way in which the Military seems to act as a check against radical Islam.  This doesn't seem like an effective check.  If they are able to radicalize the military then Islam will have it's sway over public life.  I would hope that there is some more fundamental constitutional type of check to prevent them from enforcing religious law.  If this is not the case then I fear that they will continue to fight the battle of Islam encroaching on their secular freedoms.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1442-85606181-73bb-4590-9d2d-073a82cc4b2c-1566236758"}

And then you stop using Django because FastCGI requires some deep dark magick and no one I've spoken to has had any success setting it up.\r\n\r\nAlso, the 'We don't do releases. Use the svn to install' is a spurious practice I wouldn't promote. I don't have time in this post to discuss why, and I'm not out to change Django's lack of strong release system. Merely pointing out the deficiency.

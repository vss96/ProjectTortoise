They gave ONE word: \"the slang for intercourse....The f-word is a perfect example.\" \r\n\r\nOK...but one example isn't enough to make a broad generalization like that.  They didn't mention 'cunt', but that's about the only other word that could be used as evidence that 'Americans are repressed about sex, hence the vast majority of their curse words are related to sex'.  \r\n\r\nConclusion: most American swear words are *not* related to sex, hence the author and linguistics professor didn't know wtf they were talking about.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165432301,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctvf7","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tsx7","author_flair_text":null,"author":"neuquino","retrieved_on":1473807919,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12075-bb231cf3-93c4-45dd-bb8f-547881014cd4-1566236761"}

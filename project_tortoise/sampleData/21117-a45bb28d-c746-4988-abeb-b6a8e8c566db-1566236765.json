{"body":"Sorry, was democracy suspended under Allende? He won the election fair and square. Lots of people wouldn't shed a tear if Bush was assassinated; that wouldn't make it right.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't support radical socialist reforms. But if it was really that bad, there are many options open to the people under a democratic system. According to the Wikipedia article, Allende was considering a plebiscite for his more controversial policies when he was assassinated.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm crazy, but military coups followed by dictatorships are a sign that the people wouldn't have accepted the government.\r\n\r\nThanks for providing Reddit with a great example of the fascist mentality. You don't have to have an SS armband; all you have to do is passively support murder and torture as long as your interests are taken care of.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uc9i","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1165797168,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"neilk","id":"cudin","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cucxe","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808258,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21117-a45bb28d-c746-4988-abeb-b6a8e8c566db-1566236765"}

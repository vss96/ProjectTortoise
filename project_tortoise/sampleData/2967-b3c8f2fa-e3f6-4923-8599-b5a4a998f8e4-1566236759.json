He created the original stub article and has gotten into edit wars over the evolving content ever since. (He's a wikipedia admin, so he tends to win such wars.) The recent history of the associated Talk page might give you a sense of how important it is to Mr. Connolley to have the last word:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Stephen_McIntyre&amp;action=history\r\n\r\nThe NRC report damned with faint praise by only finding the underlying claim \"plausible\" rather than \"likely\" or \"proven\" or anything of that sort. (It's similarly \"plausible\" given the evidence they evaluated that the Northern Hemisphere /wasn't/ warmer recently than in the previous millenium.) If you read it, you'll find the NRC report supported every substantial criticism of MBH made by McIntyre and McKitrick. But the NRC tried to be politically polite and left a little wiggle room. If you look at /why/ they claimed the general thrust was \"plausible\", it was based on the untested-by-them claim that other independent studies reached similar conclusions. McIntyre has since gone on to show that these other studies weren't, in fact, independent - they had many of the same flaws as MBH and often were based on the same data sets. For example, the NRC agreed with M&amp;M that it was not valid to rely on strip-bark proxies, but almost every study being held up as \"independent\" confirmation of the claims made in MBH does rely on strip-bark proxies. (McIntyre's wiki article is misleading in this regard but I've given up on trying to fix such things - Mr. Connolley is too persistent for it to be worth the effort to correct.)\r\n\r\nThe similarity between RealClimate and The Church is that RealClimate censors any mention of McIntyre's findings from its own articles and from the comments they allow to be posted in response. The RC authors also generally refuse to make their data available to skeptics and do everything they can to simply prevent the other side from being heard, rather than honestly engage on the science.","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2967-b3c8f2fa-e3f6-4923-8599-b5a4a998f8e4-1566236759"}

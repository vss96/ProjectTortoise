Nobody wants to bust their ass for somebody else's idea.\r\n\r\nTry reading \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" by Dale Carnegie.  Simply put, the best way to get somebody to work with you on your startup is to convince them that it is their idea too.\r\n\r\nThe way I go about this is to get into discussions with people about the problem that the startup would be solving, and making no mention of the fact that you're already planning on starting something.  This accomplishes a bunch of things- first, you vet your idea by talking with other people about its viability.  Second, you vet potential partners by finding out how knowledgeable and enthusiastic they are about the idea.  And, of course, there's a fairly direct path to the end goal of \"Hey, maybe we should start something to fix (problem X)\".  There's also a decent chance that they would have a unique view on the problem and the startup could totally change direction from whatever you had envisioned so far.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808702,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v0cp","id":"cv16o","author":"praetorian42","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32464-4842aa1d-42d9-4568-a142-8837966c77f4-1566236770"}

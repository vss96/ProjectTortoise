If China could concievably account for half of the total market by themselves, they could make one hell of a big difference in the value of the dollar. I'm not saying they would and ramifications for their own economy would be serious but comparing the foreign debt held by China to the US GDP is not the only thing to consider.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"142-e5aa6292-ec28-4f03-a4a8-f7c0c07f617c-1566236758"}

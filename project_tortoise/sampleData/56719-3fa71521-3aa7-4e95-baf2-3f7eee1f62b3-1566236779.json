He might say that science doesn't work by vote, but his verbiage hints at the very large body of people who agree with him, and the very small body of people who agree with McIntosh. This is truly an appeal to widespread belief.","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167402455,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56719-3fa71521-3aa7-4e95-baf2-3f7eee1f62b3-1566236779"}

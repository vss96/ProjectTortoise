Why pay for something (or produce it at all?) if somebody is just going to steal it away from you?\r\n\r\nThe idea of copyright is not inherently flawed.  The powers delegated to Congress in the constitution (\"To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries\") are quite reasonable.  The present implementation, however, is not.  \"Limited times\" now means 70 years after the author is dead.  \r\n\r\nIf I were tasked with redoing the copyright system, I'd make the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Individual copyrights should end at the author's death.  No exceptions.  Why should people earn income for something they didn't even do?\r\n2. Corporate copyrights should last for 15 years (instead of the present 95 years).  All derivative works should expire with the original copyright, so DOS/Win95 would've gone public domain in 1996, WinNT/2K/XP in 2007 (?).  This gives them the opportunity to recoup their investment through the initial hot period.  After that, works would enter the public domain, creating a large corpus of reference works that future artists &amp; innovators could refer back to.  As a side effect, it forces all creative companies to instill a culture of innovation, so they can't just rest on their laurels.  It also encourages from-the-ground-up rewrites to avoid the derivative clause; I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I think it would push companies towards keeping products simple, adjusting with the times, and using open standards-based data formats.\r\n3. Instead of patent examiners, the government should contract patent examinations out to the leading academics in the field.  This will eliminate really stupid, obvious patents like Microsoft's \"invention\" of the NOT statement or RSS.  It'll also help bridge the gap between industry and academia.  Companies have an incentive to learn all the latest academic research, because they'll be less likely to have a patent rejected on the grounds that it duplicates someone's doctoral research.  Academics have an incentive to solve problems of interest to industry, because those will generate patents that are then effectively \"published\" back to the academic community.  (Naturally, there would be conflict-of-interest requirements that prevent you from refereeing a patent that your own work has generated.)","score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166901290,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvukw","id":"cvv3v","edited":false,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809274,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47613-cd50586a-26cb-4ef0-9771-ff49fea93bb1-1566236775"}

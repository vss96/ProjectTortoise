{"controversiality":1,"body":"Ok. If you assume that I meant: slaves were contracted to design, architect and implement the pyramids, you're probably right in saying they didn't exist.\r\n\r\n But to quote your own text, it says \"There were slaves to be sure, throughout the Near East.\". It also says \" visions of the various Hollywood versions of the constructions, with thousands of foreign slaves huddled under the whips of cruel overseers, dancing through oneâ€™s brain. Such was never the case.\"\r\n\r\n And to come back to the original post, Apocalypto doesn't describe anything like that. It describes quite a structured society, not too unlike of a modern day capitalist market, where mercenaries get compensated for hunting down slaves and sell them on what looks like a market.\r\n Like I said in my original post, it's moot to discuss whether or not this was factually flawless. The point is that no matter  what you think about it, the manpower was not contracted as one might imagine like workers from Newfoundland to build the sky scrapers of Manhattan. The brute man power was almost always slave power.\r\n\r\n I really don't see how you can deny that much, and also why you would try to deny that.\r\n","link_id":"t3_u82w","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165699477,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_cu9iy","id":"cu9nm","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808185,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19044-e1077108-059e-4c86-8315-498d65b979d8-1566236764"}

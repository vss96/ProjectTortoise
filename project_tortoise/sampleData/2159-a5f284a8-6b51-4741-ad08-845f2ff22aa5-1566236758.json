I guess it's the self-absorption, but if you're willing to die you can do a lot of things.  Obviously 9/11 is the most striking example, but you could also kill the president, disrupt a live tv broadcast, etc. etc.  \r\n\r\nObviously it VERY, VERY GOOD that people don't go for the blaze of glory, but there are so many suicides and so few assassinations or 9/11s that it seems kind of strange.  I understand the factors at work (self-absorption, lack of drive to attempt something that's still difficult), just not why they seem to be so strong.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t8jy","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165008594,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2159-a5f284a8-6b51-4741-ad08-845f2ff22aa5-1566236758"}

Practice and training can help the brain solve the problem more capably, but people and other primates simply aren't wired for consistency like computers or machines. Instead, people seem to be improvisers by default.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, \"by default\" there is no drive towards consistency over any number of years. But \"practice and training\" or a self-awareness to push ourselves towards consistency still bears the kind of results that conventional wisdom supposes us to think.\r\n\r\nIts rather sad how new scientist is grossly misinterpreting this study.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vmcm","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":14,"ups":14,"created_utc":1166721388,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43583-6416b892-79b3-4d3d-94ea-0b90839ceab9-1566236774"}

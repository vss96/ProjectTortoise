However we were visiting South Africa and my uncle (who is white) without thinking walked up to the counter of a cafe and said \"could I please have a short black?\" As soon as the words were out of his mouth he cringed and a rather uncomfortable silence ensued. No one in the cafe seemed offended including the black woman who was serving him, however out of personal embassasment he still apologied, backtracked and asked for an espresso. \r\n\r\nMakes for a funny story now but at the time he felt terrible, simply becasue it could be seen as lame attempt at a joke.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity do they use the term \"black\" in Sth Africa for coffee?","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166737552,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvonx","parent_id":"t1_cvn5x","author":"jumping_hump","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809152,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44332-8a0f84e6-21e3-4d66-9a2a-2c93525a70f4-1566236774"}

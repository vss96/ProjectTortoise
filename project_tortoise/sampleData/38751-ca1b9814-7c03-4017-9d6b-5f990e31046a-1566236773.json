The average nurse is not smarter than the average doctor, but there are plenty of nurses who really go above and beyond and cause doctors to shake their heads in admiration.  My youngest brother still has his fingers thanks to a quick thinking nurse.  He was a toddler when he stuck his fingers into the tub drain.  Quickly they became too swollen to come out.  He was screaming in pain as paramedics showed up.  They popped the drain out, his fingers still quite stuck, and sped to the e.r. where the young doctor was flummoxed.  He tried ice and consulted with someone about what tools could be used to cut through the metal drain plate.  The fingers were turning dark and the gravity of the situation stressed some into inaction.  A nurse looking on used dental floss to wrap each little finger as she massaged the blood back towards the hand.  This method worked slowly but surely and she freed him in a few minutes and circulation returned to the tiny digits.  Everyone cheered for the nurse.","created_utc":1166550083,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":12,"ups":12,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvdq9","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvccb","author_flair_text":null,"author":"degustibus","retrieved_on":1473808940,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38751-ca1b9814-7c03-4017-9d6b-5f990e31046a-1566236773"}

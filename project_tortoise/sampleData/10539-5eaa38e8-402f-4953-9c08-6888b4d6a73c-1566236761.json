{"body":"I agree completely with what you say, but I still find myself buying a reasonable quantity of organic food.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because \"organic\" really means \"expensive\". It's one way to segment the market into consumers who are willing to pay more for food and those who aren't. \"Organic\" producers and sellers charge a large premium, but in return they have to provide at least a marginally better product, \"natural\" farming methods or no. The \"feel good\" value attached to the term isn't enough to sustain the market.\r\n\r\nA BMW sedan isn't \"really\" worth 5x more than a Kia. \r\nThe stuff one buys at Whole Foods isn't \"really\" 2-3x better than the discount grocer down the street. But there's a class of consumers who are willing to pay a premium for a premium product. This is true for just about every consumer good you can imagine.\r\n\r\n\"Organic\" is just one term that happened to stick, though of course it has a regulatory definition now. The class of foods sold at places like Whole Foods (much of which isn't \"organic\" by the regulatory definition) used to be called  \"gourmet\", but it's hard to sell people on the idea that their kids should be eating \"gourmet\" food because it's healthier.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tol1","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165372633,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"twoodfin","id":"cts6v","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctqz8","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807859,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10539-5eaa38e8-402f-4953-9c08-6888b4d6a73c-1566236761"}

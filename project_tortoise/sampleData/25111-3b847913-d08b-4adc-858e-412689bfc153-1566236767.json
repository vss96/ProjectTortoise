{"controversiality":0,"body":"Well, I have only heard of Richie Hawtin. There are so many DJs/producers out there, it's almost impossible to keep track of all of them. Also, the title is a bit off-beat (get it, off beat, haha) because those don't really look like lounge rooms. I would call them home studios more than anything else. Some of them look too disorganized and too cramped, similar to my own studio.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I've gotten to the point where I'm transitioning off of vinyl and using CDJs. The 1000+ records I have amassed has gotten out of hand I find that I can pretty much download everything that comes out on vinyl. Sound quality may not be as great, but sure beats hauling a crap load of records around.","link_id":"t3_uisz","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165943102,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"2speed","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cul9a","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uisz","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808404,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25111-3b847913-d08b-4adc-858e-412689bfc153-1566236767"}

Evolution is a theory. It's called the Theory of Evolution.\r\n\r\nUmm, no.  Evolution is not a theory, evolution is a fact.  There are various *theories of evolution*, the most prominent being Darwin's Theory of Evolution **By Natural Selection**.\r\n\r\nWe know evolution happens.  We can observe micro-evolution.    So it's a fact.  We have massive amounts of evidence for macro-evolution as well.  To explain it, we have theories of how it works.\r\n\r\n&gt; The material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered.\r\n\r\nOf course.  An anti-evolution sticker is not doing that, nor is any amount of \"intelligent design\", which cannot be investigated at all as it happened by magic.\r\n\r\nEvolution by Natural Selection is considered to be so incredibly unassailable that nobody who understands it doubts it in the least.  All the evidence backs it up.  In order to disprove it you'd need to have studied it extensively; the ID attacks on it are usually due to an incomplete understanding.  It's kind of like learning addition and then trying to attack algebra.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, nothing about evolution precludes a creator.  A creator could have created the big bang.  The evidence does not, however, support an evangelical interpretation of a 6,000-year-old Earth or any of their other claims.  Even if you disprove EBNS, it doesn't follow that the Bible is then correct.  Not-A does not make B true.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809250,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvti2","id":"cvttm","author":"lemmikins","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47023-e2f3d9e2-53d2-4f16-abeb-01b8e085865f-1566236775"}

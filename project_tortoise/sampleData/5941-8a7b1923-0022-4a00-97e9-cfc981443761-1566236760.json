The studyâ€™s conclusion was that the brain volume a child achieves by the age of 1 year helps determine later intelligence. Growth in brain volume after infancy may not compensate for poorer earlier growth.*\r\n\r\nGranted, it is from wikipedia, so who knows how accurate it is, and 633 seems a small sample size to me. But it does seem to suggest that the first year or so of a child's life might weigh heavily on its IQ.\r\n\r\nThis suggests a couple of things that are perhaps worth looking into. First, how does child rearing amongst the different races affect IQ, if at all? For example, it might be true that the offspring of parents who read \"all\" the baby books do better than those from parents who are ignorant of \"theory\" on those first critical years of life.\r\n\r\nSecond, I'm under the impression that there may be evidence that children who learn Chinese or Japanese (etc.) perform better on math tests. The hypothesis behind this idea is that learning to read in these languages requires more spatially oriented brain use than learning English or French for example.\r\n\r\nPut the two together, and you get a situation where environmental factors may have a bigger factor in IQ than the author's notion that genetic differences account for most of racial differences.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"5941-8a7b1923-0022-4a00-97e9-cfc981443761-1566236760"}

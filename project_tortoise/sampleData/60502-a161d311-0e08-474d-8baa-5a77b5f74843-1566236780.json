The plaster is also something that will have to be patched every 5 years too. Putting a house like this in soil means that it's going to have to expand and contract and that's definitely going to crack the plaster. Also, when the plaster cracks, in comes water and bugs.\r\n\r\nI bet it also smells like what I would expect an earthen home to smell like -- like living in a grave.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine the look on a realtor's face when they're called out to sell the thing?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wis1","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809749,"author":"supermike","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwkb9","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wis1","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60502-a161d311-0e08-474d-8baa-5a77b5f74843-1566236780"}

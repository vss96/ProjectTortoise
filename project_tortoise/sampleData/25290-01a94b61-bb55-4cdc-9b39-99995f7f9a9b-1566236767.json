{"body":"I have a portable CD player I bought a few years ago that cost me a grand total of thirty dollars.  Are you aware of the number of $20 CDs out there?\r\n\r\nI have a five-disk changer stereo component that also plays DVDs, and thus has to connect with my TV -- and I don't happen to have a TV card in any of my computers, so it's doing things none of my computers can do.\r\n\r\nI have computers without GPUs.\r\n\r\nYou're using generalizations to compare what amounts to a modern gaming machine with what must be a dedicated stereo component CD player circa 1992, price adjusted for inflation.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_ujgi","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165948424,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"apotheon","edited":false,"id":"culom","parent_id":"t1_cujun","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808412,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25290-01a94b61-bb55-4cdc-9b39-99995f7f9a9b-1566236767"}

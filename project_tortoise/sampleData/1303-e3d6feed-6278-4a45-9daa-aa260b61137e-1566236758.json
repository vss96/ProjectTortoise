Most employed people in those areas, as well as retail, clerical and (regrettably) many blue-collar professions are having their income being squeezed downwards since the 1980s. The only barrier between the current situation and total collapse is outfits like the UAW, and it would seem like they won't be around for long.\r\n\r\n\"Regrettably\", since it used to be that decent blue-collar wages meant the difference between indigence and dignity for a huge number of families where the breadwinner did not go to college. Also, it is healthy for a society that blue-collar families have good access to culture and education, as it tends to get them into the political arena, as opposed to their being utterly indifferent to what goes on -- which creates a negative feedback loop that pushes them further downwards.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807489,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ct8ch","id":"ct8ik","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"hidalberto","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1303-e3d6feed-6278-4a45-9daa-aa260b61137e-1566236758"}

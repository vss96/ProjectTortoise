{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; (While I am not accusing you of homophobic, calling gays as \"sissy\" is a little disparaging.. What about those tough macho ones..??\r\n\r\nI was putting it in a 5-year-old's vocabulary, since I was talking about a 5-year-old's sexuality.  Perhaps I should have put the word in \"quotes\" to make it more clear.\r\n\r\n&gt; Age 5 is a little too early to know/realize your sexual preference.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm going to disagree.  Don't confuse an adult's understanding of sexual \"preference\" with a child's understanding of gender, and their own developing sexuality.\r\n\r\nThere was a [terrific article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/02/us/02child.html?ei=5087%0A&amp;em=&amp;en=f2471074a89d829a&amp;ex=1165467600&amp;pagewanted=print) in the New York Times ([non-reg-required-link](http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/nation/12/02/2gender.html) ) recently by [Patricia Leigh Brown](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/patricia_leigh_brown/index.html), just a little more than a week ago (Dec 2), \"Supporting Boys or Girls When the Line Isn't Clear\".\r\n\r\nTake note of this excerpt: \"Studies suggest that the majority of boys with marked gender variance early in childhood grow up to be gay, and about a quarter heterosexual, said Dr. Edgardo Menvielle, a psychiatrist at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.\"\r\n\r\nA 5-year-old might not *know that they're gay\", but they can obviously *know something is different*, and can struggle with their feelings about that difference.  And probably look back with the benefit of years of hindsight and recognize what it was they were struggling with.","link_id":"t3_uhv4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165902905,"score":7,"ups":7,"author":"toastspork","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuj7b","parent_id":"t1_cuixp","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808366,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24181-7c80de26-7ffb-45e4-897d-3b3f496121d3-1566236767"}

My doctor says the BMI for me is blatently wrong and not to worry about it, saying it's hard to place me safely in the overweight range for my shape. I also recently did a bodyfat analyzer, that sends a mild electric current through your body to see how long it takes and measure the body fat accordingly, which said I'm in the normal range with 16% body fat.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say I'm in shape, but I do have a lot of muscle mass on my legs, like all muscle. My torso is pure flab, I think I have my abs somewhere but they're unlikely to be seen again until spring rolls around.\r\n\r\nSo IMO the BMI is worthless unless you have the medical average fat-muscle ratio, the medical average bone density and the medical average size ratios. Anyone not average in one of them is going to get worse and worse results the further they are out.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vizl","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166670502,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42437-593b3c32-fb23-4868-bd07-a7c8bf8e17b1-1566236774"}

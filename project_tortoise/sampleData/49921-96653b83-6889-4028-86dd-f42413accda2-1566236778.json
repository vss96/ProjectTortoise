There's always some guy suing to have it taken out because it's said in public schools so the history gets brought up frequently.  I consider it nearly common knowledge but not quite.\r\n\r\nBut... so what?  It didn't have it, then they added it.  You could say the same thing about the bill of rights.\r\n\r\nAlso why is the most disturbing thing about the pledge the mention of God?  To me it's this part:  \"I pledge allegiance to the *flag*...\"  HuH?!?  And you're supposed to say this while facing the flag and essentially saluting it.  Flag worship is complete craziness.  If there is a God then worshiping Him makes sense.  There *is* a flag and worshiping it makes NO sense.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vy2e","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167070415,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"49921-96653b83-6889-4028-86dd-f42413accda2-1566236778"}

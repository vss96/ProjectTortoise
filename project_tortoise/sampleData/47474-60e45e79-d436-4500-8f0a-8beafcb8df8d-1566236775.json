The companies may not be competing, but people will still have to choose which one(s) to buy, and there will still be sales rankings.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also, the Genesis did NOT beat the SNES. If I remember correctly, the market shares were roughly 16% for Sega and 84% for Nintendo (I think that's from \"Game Over\", the famous Nintendo history book, but I could be wrong). Of course, I do agree that winning has nothing to do with hardware.\r\n\r\nAlso, although I loved the N64 and preferred it to the playstation, it was also inferior when it came to video. (Remember, that's why Squaresoft switched to Sony)\r\n\r\nThose things said, I do agree that Sony is on the path to failure for being hardware driven, overpricing their system (even if they lose money), and making boring games.

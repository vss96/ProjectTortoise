Maybe you\r\nneed a refresher:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Large_Numbers\r\n\r\nNevertheless: If out of 10 couples, 10 women tell me that their baby (who looks pretty much like every other baby at that stage) looks like daddy, while daddy doesn't always agree, then this is good enough for me to think something is up. If a group of researchers actually bother to do statistics and collect the data and the same thing happens with a set 7 times as large, I think I would have to come up with some explanation other than random chance. You've got to have your head way up your ass otherwise. \r\n\r\nIt is hard to *prove* evolutionary psychology. As long as you believe in free will, any behaviors could be attributed to random idiosyncracy. But there are instinctive behaviors which are blatantly and obviously not random - I'm sure you've seen videos of baby kangaroos climb out of the mother's pouch and instinctively head towards the mother's udder - where did it get that information from ? \r\n\r\nI'm convinced this reaction of women is a similar instinctive reaction. There's a huge commitment required of their husbands to bring up the child, since humans take at least 12 years to reach maturity.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tl4m","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10054-cfb4a6dd-00de-4574-a877-faeac0593359-1566236761"}

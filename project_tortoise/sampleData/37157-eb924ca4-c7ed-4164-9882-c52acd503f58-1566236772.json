So the fact that \"Christ is no longer on the cross and he is in heaven\" is irrelevant as an attempted disproof (even if you don't believe the actual content).\r\n\r\n&gt;He was not divine, he is not the son of god, his death means no more then the deaths of billions of other human beings.\r\n\r\nI disagree, but I expect you've gathered that already.\r\n\r\n&gt;When somebody professes to be christian I treat them the same as I would treaty anybody who told me they worshipped zeus.\r\n\r\nAnd how, may I ask, is that?","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166487371,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvadx","parent_id":"t1_cv9pn","author":"Odd_Bloke","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808876,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37157-eb924ca4-c7ed-4164-9882-c52acd503f58-1566236772"}

Many of them were pretty good but there was something about them all that didn't feel right. Rails came the closest to what I wanted, but I felt that it had too much \"magic\" and didn't perform well. You were left in the dark if you didn't want to do it the \"Rails\" way.\r\n\r\nSo of course I went and built my own web framework. It's not out yet because it needs a lot more polish before it's ready for general consumption, but we're almost to the point where every bit of code for our startup is in Haskell (this includes XHTML, CSS, and database stuff).\r\n\r\nWhen I feel it's polished enough, I'll release it under the BSD license. I'm shankys on #haskell. Come bug me there if you want to know more.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0ju","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809380,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ss498","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w0ju","id":"cw0o5","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50391-fe046e73-3b51-4b78-b109-2e3e6afced69-1566236778"}

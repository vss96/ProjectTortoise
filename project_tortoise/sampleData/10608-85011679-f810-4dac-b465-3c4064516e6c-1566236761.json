He killed a man and he's lucky to only get 22. When he's 37 he's still got a lot of life left to live, which is a lot more than most murderers sentenced to life get. Should other murderers be allowed to go free after a year or so because prison is hard and they don't get no skoolin'?\r\n\r\nYou can make it as complicated and socially oriented as you want, but the fact is that he killed a man, others have killed men, and his sentence is lienient when compared to the usual. Allowing breaks just because he was young means allowing breaks for everyone for some reason. It's allowing you to be free because you are \"sorry.\" And in this case, sorry doesn't cut it.","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10608-85011679-f810-4dac-b465-3c4064516e6c-1566236761"}

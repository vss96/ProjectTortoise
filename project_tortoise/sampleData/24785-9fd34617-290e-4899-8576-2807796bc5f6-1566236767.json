I used to own a recorder, and these days, making \"Line in\" recordings is in many ways the only way to legally make a copy of music, (or is it?).  \r\nI rip techno music from internet radio stations and use them in my music player.  I have no desire to listen to mainstream music, i dont listen to the radio, and I dont really care about having a beatles collection.  \r\n\r\nThis concept of \"buying\" digital music and limiting its use so much is stifling its own profits.  I liked it when I could just BUY a CD, go home, rip MP3s off of it and put it in my MP3 player and not have to worry.  When I had my minidisc player, i used to record the CD using optical out, and literally had to play the CD and record to mini disc, like tapes almost but much better quality.  Mini disc is also good for recording from records, which I plan on doing in the future as well.  \r\n\r\nSony revolutionized the world with the first walkman, maybe it can come up with something else?","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165934358,"ups":-6,"score":-6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24785-9fd34617-290e-4899-8576-2807796bc5f6-1566236767"}

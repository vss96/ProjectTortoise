Just dazzled and intimidated by the length of it, as most men are. \r\n\r\nNow coming to the article, I find myself with no clear justification for monopolistic rent seeking or cartel behavior. Assuming people can seek out information just because it is out there is wrong. Who should take the blame for a lifetime of not educating him about seeking out information, about the capitalist urge to maximize information asymmetry unless you arbitrage it out all by yourself.\r\nShould rationale and intelligent behavior be assumed in an economic model or seen as benefits of solid governmental policies? Efficient and 'just' markets do emerge from self-seeking individual behavior, but shouldn't an entity with the power of global vision dole its fruits to all the players in equal measure?\r\n\r\nWisdom is not distributed equally, and the state helping those with clearly defined mental deficiencies is only a fuzzy difference away from helping those who cannot perceive implications of their actions with clarity. People rushing into these usuries fall into that category for me.\r\n\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47817-ef6240b2-e150-4f87-87f8-6259d6b76be2-1566236775"}

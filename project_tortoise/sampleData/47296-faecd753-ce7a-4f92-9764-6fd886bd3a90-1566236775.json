Not 0, but certainly not very often. My bugs are logic and other such things.\r\n\r\nThat matches my experience with Java &amp; C++, but I'm curious what you consider logic and what you consider type errors.  When I program in Java, most of my bugs are things like NPEs, invalid state, and statements in the wrong order (usually on a non-local basis; for example, one recent bug in Tomcat6 that recently bit us was that a certain singleton was being initialized *after* user code was called, so that it wasn't valid when our code called it).  Haskell's type system will catch these.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vr55","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47296-faecd753-ce7a-4f92-9764-6fd886bd3a90-1566236775"}

This is the one thing that wrecks my head about python - it doesn't even have 'flatten' for lists and sorting dictionaries is a pain. \r\n\r\nArrays/Lists and hash/dictionaries (at least the way i program) are the basic tools of the trade. I've moved from Ruby to Python for a particular practical reason and although i really like python i couldn't believe it only has like 10 built in array methods. Ruby has like 50.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's a reason behind this like anit-perl'only one way to do it' but i don't like it.\r\n\r\nWhile i'm on a rant about python: where is the place where i can find a list of ALL python standard library predefined classes and all of their methods?

I claim that, since I come from a exclusively side-effect-full imperative background, the syntax of do-notation feels familiar, and I'm more likely to assume the \"particular imperative interpretation\" of it.  Indeed, this *is* a misstep of my own, but evidence suggests it is a common one among imperative-background programmers.\r\n\r\nWould I claim that do-notation is \"harmful\"?  Well, now that I understand how to decompose do-notation into binds and lambdas, and now that I'm comfortable enough with types to understand why a particular expression doesn't check, and now that I've had the opportunity to write expressions in at least two different Monads (IO and Parsec's CharParser), I find do-notation to be quite handy.  \r\n\r\nI suppose I would discourage newcomers from relying on it too much without understanding its semantics.  But I guess that's sensible enough advice to apply to anything. :)","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ujjo","subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166368315,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33878-0bc55578-ff4f-455e-9872-4ffb8c001f6b-1566236771"}

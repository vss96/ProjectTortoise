When the two join together and form a life, that life *WILL* assuming nothing goes wrong, become a BEING LIKE YOU. To advance the idea that it is alright to end a process that will create a being just like you, a process that has *ALREADY TAKEN PLACE*, a process that *WILL* succeed -- is vastly different than the idea that sperm or eggs alone *WILL* become a BEING LIKE YOU.\r\n\r\nEnding human life *IS WRONG*. Ending a process that will create human life *IS WRONG*.\r\n\r\nNow, in the world we live in -- unfortunately, we dont get to experience what is 100% right all the time. Often we must choose 'lesser evils' (any evil is just as bad though in reality) -- so some will say: \"Hey Carl, what about if a woman is raped, is then abortion justified?\" -- answer, it is not justified, but neither is the rape -- thus whatever happens will be evil (If the child is born in such a situation, its evil. If the child is aborted, its evil.) -- thus there exist many cases where there is simply *NO* truly righteous answer.\r\n\r\nSame with the concept of killing in general. Killing *PERIOD* is wrong! What about wars? Killing in wars is wrong. So what happens when you have a situation that you either kill a soldier who is aiming a gun at you, or get killed yourself? Answer -- either way will create evil. Either way is therefore wrong.","link_id":"t3_ua04","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165787027,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20820-556a27be-1e2e-410e-9003-97c3c0955548-1566236765"}

Some women wear them a bit tighter than others and some women prefer them looser.  I've found that a looser or tighter fit than usual will muck up the whole show!  Make sure you stare good and hard at a woman's bust first to try and analyze that \"tightness\" factor.  If the woman in question asks what you are doing, just tell them you are preparing to do a trick.  Or you could do like I do and just stick to tying cherry stems in a knot with your tongue!

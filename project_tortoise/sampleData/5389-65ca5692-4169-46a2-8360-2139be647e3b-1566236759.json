Music has degrees of cross-cultural appeal and has mathematical structures that have been studied well over centuries.  There exists a \"mainstream\" that hooks into the brains of many people.  The notable composers are able to find this and write something memorable.  Professional composers have to find it to make a living off it.  If the modern process produces something that appeals to somebody, what do you care if it doesn't appeal to you?\r\n\r\nIf there is a problem, it's that the authentically good bands, musicians, and composers need to figure out better ways to spread their art.  Competing with manufactured pop can be done, just not in a heads-up offensive against the conservative music industry.\r\n\r\n(And \"stealing\" isn't it either.)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tenx","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165180899,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5389-65ca5692-4169-46a2-8360-2139be647e3b-1566236759"}

{"body":"This line of thinking makes a lot of sense.  Lisp is a research language for a research community, just as Haskell is becoming now.  It is therefore not at all surprising that most of the good ideas are came out of the Lisp community for a while, and are now coming out of the Haskell and O'Caml communities.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like a lot of mechanical engineers(Lisp programmers) expect people to make cars with their own machine shop tools(base Lisp), or use their prototypes(macro routines, CLOS,etc). In fact, you have to have a whole machine shop at your location(A lisp environment) just to drive a car!\r\n\r\nPython,Ruby, and recently the .net languages are producing cars(LINQ/DLINQ, blocks,etc) for people to drive, and in some cases(py2exe,OCaml,Haskell), you can even drive the car without a machine shop in your garage ;-).\r\n\r\n","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_unxc","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165988678,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"insectbear","edited":false,"id":"cuo0q","parent_id":"t3_unxc","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808456,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26448-64b7075d-f26b-4908-94ed-9e6763d3735e-1566236767"}

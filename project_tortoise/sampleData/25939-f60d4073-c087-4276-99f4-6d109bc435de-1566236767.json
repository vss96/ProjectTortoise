You are presented with facts and pear reviewed papers and fail to read it and instead mock it.   You don’t want to argue any of the facts you just keep spouting the same old story over and over.  Even if that story has been found lacking.  People try to point out your error but instead want to continue down the same line of reasoning.   \r\n\r\nPlease read through the paper, if you have problems with it then point them out, otherwise you have chosen to believe in 911 conspiracies without basing it in any kind of reason or science.    \r\n","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165967400,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cumzi","parent_id":"t1_cumxe","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Fountainhead","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808436,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25939-f60d4073-c087-4276-99f4-6d109bc435de-1566236767"}

The D.A. seems to be saying that, had Wilson agreed to plead guilty to misconduct with the 17-year old, then he would not have been charged with the crime involving the 15-year old. The same jury which was, by the law, compelled to find him guilty of the oral sex charge very quickly *acquitted* Wilson of raping the 17-year old, easily finding the videotape to show consensual sex with her.","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38823-b5104ac4-2244-4558-b9d8-fc965b743cdf-1566236773"}

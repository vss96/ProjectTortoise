The only advice I would give is that it is good to know enough about several computer languages in order to be able to pick an appropriate language for the job you want to do.\r\n\r\nI ran into an old friend of mine the other day.  I won't use his name without permission, but he is a well-known software engineer and he invented web technology that many of use use every day.  We both found it interesting that both of us are using PHP for our current web-based projects (in case it matters, my PhD thesis was on computer languages, I've taught OOP, and have built large projects in more languages than I can remember).  And we are both using PHP by choice.  I even rewrote an old web app of mine from Java into PHP recently, because it was easier to rewrite it than to maintain the old Java code.\r\n\r\nDoes that mean that I think PHP &gt; Java?  Of course not!  There are many web apps for which Java would be a far more appropriate language than PHP.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful that we have such a wide choice of languages for writing the server-side code for web apps.  I just wish we had more of a choice on the client side.  Not that I hate JavaScript/ECMAScript, but it would have been nice for browsers to implement a Virtual Machine rather than some/any high-level language, so that we could pick the appropriate client-side language for different jobs.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w0ju","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167110630,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50696-e0ee7a08-7acd-4f99-9373-eaa63615a81e-1566236778"}

You enter the line and it STAYS there ?\r\n\r\nWhen you move code blocks you specify the point you're inserting at. The editor makes sure the indentation of the pasted lines is adjusted accordingly while pasting. The few cases where that doesn't work, you can change the indentation level of the entire block right after pasting through the correct indent/unindent editor shortcuts.\r\n\r\n&gt;Bad for you. I NEVER had to manually indent lisp code :))\r\n\r\nAnd I've never had to manually add closing parens to python code blocks.

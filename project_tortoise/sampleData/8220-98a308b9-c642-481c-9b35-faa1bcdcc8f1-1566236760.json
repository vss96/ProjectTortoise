Dustin Diaz of Yahoo makes that point well in the linked comment thread by referring to Yahoo Mail -- you basically can't build a rich web-based application like that without relying on JavaScript, so you either have to turn away non-JS-enabled clients, or build a completely separate, static HTML interface for them.\r\n\r\nIn Yahoo's case, they've apparently decided that it's worth keeping the older interface around for that purpose, but not everyone has that luxury, so not everyone will be able to make that tradeoff.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165290512,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8220-98a308b9-c642-481c-9b35-faa1bcdcc8f1-1566236760"}

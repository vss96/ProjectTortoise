From Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n&gt; For example, the USSR was highly dependent on trains, yet the desperate need to produce weapons meant that fewer than 20 new locomotives were produced in the USSR during the entire war. In this context, the supply of 1,981 US locomotives can be better understood. Likewise, the Soviet air force was almost completely dependent on US supplies of very high octane aviation fuel. Although most Red Army tank units were equipped with Soviet-built tanks, their logistical support was provided by hundreds of thousands of high-quality US-made trucks. Indeed by 1945 nearly two-thirds of the truck strength of the Red Army was US-built. Trucks such as the Dodge Â¾ ton and Studebaker 2.5 ton, were easily the best trucks available in their class on either side on the Eastern Front.[1][2] US supplies of waterproof telephone cable, aluminium and canned rations were also critical.","link_id":"t3_u5eq","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808178,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"leoc","edited":false,"id":"cu992","parent_id":"t1_cu6x0","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18793-5c7323e6-a6e5-4df7-99b5-3a3114da52cb-1566236764"}

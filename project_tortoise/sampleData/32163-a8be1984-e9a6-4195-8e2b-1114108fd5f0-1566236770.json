So if it's just another student, you have to trust that they care. What if they don't? It's obvious the many students who had already FOUND and PLAYED with this gun didn't care. So it's likely he KNEW he had to take the situation into his own hands before someone did something stupid and someone got hurt. True, if you don't have to touch it don't touch it. But if life could be in danger, it overrules that 100% of the time. This guy had reasonable doubt as it whether it was safe to leave this gun in the bathroom. I commend him for doing the right thing, and think it's unfortunate he's going to be punished for it. I think the kids who found and played with it and did not report it should all be expelled instead.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32163-a8be1984-e9a6-4195-8e2b-1114108fd5f0-1566236770"}

However I always like a good revenge story (fictitious or real) and this one was simply not a good one.  The people who caused him trouble where the employees and the manager.  Then he took revenge on the corporation.  The employee's maybe had a bit of trouble that day but I am sure its no big deal.  In fact probably many  enjoyed that kind of mayhem.  \r\n\r\nA real revenge should end with the manager and employees fired or beaten up, nothing less.","controversiality":0,"score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1167344971,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cw9na","id":"cwaqf","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ArcticCelt","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809571,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55701-7f2903f9-88da-4961-aed5-774e0c06cd7a-1566236779"}

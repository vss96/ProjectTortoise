{"body":"I think I wasn't clear either then :)\r\n\r\nTehnically your can POST and PUT to any URI you want of course. The article mentions those two URIs because if we acknowledge the general meaning of a URI finishing with .html, it's more likely thant it will be a resource not a process we'll find there thus the notion that POSTing to such URI is somehow against HTTP principles. If I mentionned REST it's simply to hightlight the meaning I was giving to a resource.

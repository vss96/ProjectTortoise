Evolution is a combination of chance mutation and natural selection ... selection exerts a highly non-random effect on the development of any species.\r\n\r\nThis is, in my opinion, where Dawkins always falls short in his argument. He claims the process has no intelligence but he also simultaneously claims that it is in no way random. He does the same thing in his interview on the Colbert Report (if you want to look the that up on YouTube).\r\n\r\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I'm a theist who happens the believe in evolution as well as God. I think that Dawkin's theory on the selfish gene is brilliant, but everything I've heard from him lately is less about science and more about his vitriolic hatred for religion. \r\n\r\n","controversiality":1,"score":-19,"ups":-19,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166980333,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48653-ebc28f66-e9bd-4ed3-9d13-ee65c760fe54-1566236777"}

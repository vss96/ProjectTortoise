{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_taga","body":"For real. I had seen this puzzle before and didn't figure it out, but this time I did. It's bullshit. First of all, they add all these irrelevant colors to the dice, which is needless. Obviously, it's a puzzle where you're supposed to \"think laterally\" or else they wouldn't be such asses about \"the title of the game isâ€¦\" Not that the clue is all that helpful, but throwing in colors to the die, especially colors of parts of a rose just makes the puzzle harder than it needs to be. Probably Bill Gates just brute forced it until he figured out (spoilers): If there's a 3, +2, if there's a 5, +4. So he didn't see _why_ those numbers are the numbers that come into play. Big deal. The reason they do is this \"lateral thinking\" crap, but meanwhile, Bill Gates thought about the software market in the same completely forward, brute force way and devastated all of his opponents, while they were busy reading the \"Prince\" and \"Art of War.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, results are all that matters. Lateral thinking is fun, but useless outside of specially engineered riddles and such.","controversiality":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165057023,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctbb1","id":"ctbwb","author_flair_text":null,"author":"earthboundkid","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807553,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3123-d62c1e25-f279-44ba-bb9b-9bf8e8ab22ea-1566236759"}

{"body":"I'll admit I look like an asshole on here, but it's kind of an absurd argument.  I mean, he's claiming that without religion, we'd be living in some utopian wonderland.  Intuitively, that makes no sense.  As much as one would like to hate on religion, blaming it for all the world's problems comes across as immature and silly.  \r\n\r\nWhat you're talking about is either proof or a citation, right?  Well, this isn't something that can easily be proven, since there are very few societies without religion.  The best example would probably be Japan.  Buddhism and Shintoism are both very weak in the influence they have over Japanese society.  It's fundamentally (though not completely) an atheist society that isn't reactionary against religion, like communism was.  It just simply doesn't have religion.  However, it most definitely has evil.  I think the Yakuza killing entire families counts as that.\r\n\r\nSo, I promised myself I'd stop getting into arguments, and I doubt anyone's reading this, but there's my explanation.

There were around 220,000 killed in the combined bombings, while there were somewhere between 210,000 and 290,000 killed in Okinawa. Over 100,000 were killed in conventional bombing of Tokyo and most agree we would have had to invade Japan to end the war, most likely resulting in far more deaths than the two atomic bombs. Giving nuclear weapons bogeyman status in our minds avoids the real debate about killing in general, IMHO.\r\n\r\nIt *is* a shame that war mongering men in Japan with the unchecked power to wage war could make decisions that ultimately led to this. I watch us in the U.S. currently eroding our own checks and balances in the name of National Security and wonder how far away we are from the same situation (and no, I am NOT saying our actions in Iraq are at all similar to Japan's actions the started half of WWII).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v77e","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35907-cf94f29b-848f-4b38-97ce-be897589e158-1566236771"}

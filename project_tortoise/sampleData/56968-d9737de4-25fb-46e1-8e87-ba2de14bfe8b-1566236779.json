The problem facing electronics at the time was the \"Tyranny of Numbers\" [2].  This was a problem of interconnecting enough components to make a meaningful system.  While Kilby came up with the monolithic idea of putting all the components on a single piece of silicon, Noyce is credited with having the practical solution of making the chips with the planar process [3].\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT3138743&amp;id=O89pAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=3138743\r\n\r\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_numbers\r\n\r\n[3] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_process","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167411678,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56968-d9737de4-25fb-46e1-8e87-ba2de14bfe8b-1566236779"}

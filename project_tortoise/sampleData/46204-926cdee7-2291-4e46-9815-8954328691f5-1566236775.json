{"body":"About 440,000 Americans died in car accidents in the past ten years. 6.5 million died of heart disease. Let's keep things in perspective.\r\n\r\nFrom [The New Republic](https://ssl.tnr.com/p/docsub.mhtml?i=20061211&amp;s=sunstein121106):\r\n\r\n&gt; Since the 1960s, the number of Americans killed by international terrorism is about the same as the number killed by lightning or by accidents caused by deer. If an attack of the magnitude of September 11 occurred every three months for the next five years--an unlikely event, to say the least--the probability of being killed in such an attack would remain tiny: 0.02 percent, to be precise.\r\n\r\n(For those of you who work for Verizon, 0.02% = 0.0002)","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vrbt","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166822596,"score":10,"ups":10,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"raldi","id":"cvscn","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvsan","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809222,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46204-926cdee7-2291-4e46-9815-8954328691f5-1566236775"}

It would probably be *relatively* bloodless, compared to revolutions involving guns and violence. It's also a relatively passive form of political resistance, ala Gandhi. \r\n\r\nWhen they show up with guns to take your money, it's obvious who the aggressors are, so the revolution would maintain the moral upper hand.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, society would likely remain mostly intact. Federal income taxes for the most part go directly to paying down the national debt, and are absorbed before they go to paying for the 'services' provided by the government. Most local service are provided for with sales taxes, fees, etc. \r\n\r\nSo the government services which unfortunately have historically provided by the government which are necessary for society to function will likely remain intact.\r\n\r\nHow does that sound?","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166145766,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuub1","id":"cuufn","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoFixedAbode","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808574,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29448-f575d598-46ef-40c1-9fa6-e65b6690399c-1566236769"}

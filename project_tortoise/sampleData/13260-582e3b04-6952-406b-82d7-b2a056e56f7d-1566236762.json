I can just imagine someone paying good money for the moped ride on the folding chair tied down with cable ties to the plywood board.\r\n\r\nIn a rural part of USA, I grabbed a dinner from a Chinese restaurant on Wednesday evening. When I arrived there and made my order, a Chinese-American girl with a thick Chinese accent made certain to lower her head a little and unusually try to catch my eye contact, and when she had it, she began to speak loudly to verify my order. She also seemed more than courteous with me.\r\n\r\nI then realized that there was a reason for this. She thought I was slightly hard of hearing! I had this wireless Bluetooth earpiece in my ear for my cellphone. Mine is so small and fairly comfortable, and blocks cold air, that I actually begin to forget I have it in my ear. Since these are so new, and she seemed like she was just off the boat and had just come to America, and was now in a very rural part of America, she may have very well have mistaken this for a hearing aid!

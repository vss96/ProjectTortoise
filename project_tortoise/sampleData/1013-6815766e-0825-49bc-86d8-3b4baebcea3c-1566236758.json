{"controversiality":0,"body":"Bubble 2.0-- and I agree that there is a bit of one-- is not likely to pop as catastrophically as Bubble 1.0 for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- Much less money per company has been invested this time around.  Bubble 2.0 is driven more by \"pro-ams\" and micro-startups.\r\n\r\n- People aren't trying to go public with no profit (or even no *revenue*) like they did in the late 90s.  That's a sure way to have a spectacular flame-out.\r\n\r\n- VCs and angels are at least a little bit smarter this time around.  The first question they ask is \"so where's the business model\" and they are less impressed by dot.com BS lines, \"impressive teams,\" \"first mover advantage,\" and other ethereal things.\r\n\r\nSo like I said... I do think there's a *little bit* of a bubble in 2.0-land predicated on fallacies like \"if you make something people want, you can usually monetize it.\"  But I think it's more likely to just deflate.

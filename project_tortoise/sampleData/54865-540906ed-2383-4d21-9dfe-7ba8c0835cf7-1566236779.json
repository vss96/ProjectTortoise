That's is the point.  Public schooling can be a waste of time or even be detrimental.\r\n\r\nAs for \"edjikated idjits\", it sounds like your grandfather is very astute--he already saw the problem.  And that is the point of unschooling, most people are smart, self-motivated (with encouragement), and know stuff without someone having to \"teach\" it to them.  Remember most people didn't learn to pee, walk, or talk by being told in detail how to do it--instead they just did it by self-determination (and a little encouragement from mom and dad).\r\n\r\nI know an older man with a fifth-grade education who a lot of people see as not very smart.  Well, I see it differently.  He is probably the kindest, friendliest, and most outreaching person I know.  And, guess what, I saw how he maintains more \"odd jobs\" (at good wages) than he has time for.  I saw him convert a \"client\" who was thinking of dropping him into another season of work.  It wasn't by groveling but by real sales skills.\r\n\r\nPeople are smart.  The public school system is often dumb.\r\n","retrieved_on":1473809540,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw90k","parent_id":"t1_cw6el","author_flair_text":null,"author":"ezekiel","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54865-540906ed-2383-4d21-9dfe-7ba8c0835cf7-1566236779"}

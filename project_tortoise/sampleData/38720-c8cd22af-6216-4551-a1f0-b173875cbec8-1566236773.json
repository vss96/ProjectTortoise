{"body":"&gt;I'd expect anyone to be able to recognize that their behavior is hypocritical, including racism and sexism\r\n\r\nI do to, but since I suspect they are also human beings, outside being Jews, I assume some of them will still be assholes, regardless of their people's history.\r\n\r\nIt all comes back to the fact this story is report of a crime in Israel, and Reddit's special breed of hateful hypocrites are presenting is as an example of Israel and Jews. If beating that woman was legal in Israel, you'd have a real story here and a real case for blaming the Jews for not learning from their own history. \r\n\r\nIt's not, and therefore charging \"Jews\" on some violent fucks' actions is foolish, even though these criminals are Jewish. If someone would pass judgment on all black people because some of them commited a crime, or on all Italian Americans because of the Mafia, we'd rightly call them bigots. Yet, from the comment ratings we see that judging all Jews on that story is well accepted in Reddit.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vat3","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166549540,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"lennox125","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvdhv","edited":false,"id":"cvdon","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808939,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38720-c8cd22af-6216-4551-a1f0-b173875cbec8-1566236773"}

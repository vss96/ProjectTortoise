{"controversiality":0,"body":"I had similar complaints to vagif about moving code blocks around.\r\n\r\nThen I discovered \"Rectangular Region\" editting commands.\r\n\r\nTry them, they make whitespace sensitivity much less of an issue.\r\n\r\nBoth emacs and vim have support for this kind of selection.  Lesser editors might be out of luck.\r\n\r\nEmacs: C-x r C-h will list you all the options you have.  It's also mixed in with saving to registers (saving rectangles to registers) but the key operations are: open-rectangle, delete-rectangle, copy-rectangle-to-register, and insert-register.\r\n\r\nVim: Control-v enters \"Visual Rectangle\" mode.  Check it out.\r\n\r\nI edit Haskell code with these style of commands and they make Layout much less of an problem when moving code around.\r\n","link_id":"t3_uhgd","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165887022,"score":5,"ups":5,"author":"ricercar","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuifi","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uhgd","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808352,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23790-e1952dd5-7530-4e12-a9f4-74aa10c30443-1566236767"}

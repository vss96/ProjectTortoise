Lunch at Taco Bell is $3 while a decent Greek Salad is $7. If I was broke, I wouldn't think twice about picking Taco Bell every day.\r\n\r\nDon't tell me I should make the salad on my own. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have the time to prepare their meals in advance, especially the ones barely making a living from hourly jobs. And I didn't make the Cheesy Rice &amp; Bean Burritos either.\r\n\r\nFruit salads are even worse. I can't believe that I can get a custom 12\" sub loaded with cheese and meat for $4.67 while a few piece of machine cut apples, grapes, pineapples cost $6 when packaged as a \"fresh fruit salad.\"\r\n\r\nI'm aware of the economies of scale and think somewhere along the line, our preferences went horribly wrong. If more people would demand cheaper, healthier meals, I'm certain companies would go out of their way to do that.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong but with even McDonalds selling salads, it seems the demand for healthier meals have indeed increased in the last few years. However, since there isn't much of a demand for \"cheaper\" healthier meal, a good salad is still 4x the price of a burger at the same place. I think this trend can indeed be reversed if the ones that want healthy food, demand it more of it at a cheaper price.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tol1","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165331900,"score":18,"ups":18,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9012-77d864c6-dc86-4d26-bdd6-477e4293ec2b-1566236760"}

In fact, racist violence was often carried out by the police, including famously, the murders of schwerner, cheney, and goodman. \r\n\r\nSo while the NRA's  conception of \"self-defense\" probably includes a \"shoot first ask questions last\" clause, hampton and the panthers by contrast, did not actually believe they could defend themselves from the US government with a few rifles. The purpose was to draw attention to the fact that Black people were not being given equal protection under the law, and in fact, had every reason to fear the police and protect themselves as best they could. \r\n\r\nI don't believe in violence, and much prefer the MLK/Ghandi school, but I do think people have a right to defend themselves. The context of the NRA membership and that of Black folks in the 70s cannot be equated.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167321051,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cw7tp","id":"cw9bx","edited":false,"author":"docsplice","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809545,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55010-c06bb9e3-79a9-4398-8fd8-7cfd24dd9ac5-1566236779"}

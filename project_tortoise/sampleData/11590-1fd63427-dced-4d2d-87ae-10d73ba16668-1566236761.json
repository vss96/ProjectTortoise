The spammers can create pretty much unbounded quantities of spam.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite a project to educate the public sufficiently to change spam response rates from (say) 0.01% to 0.001%, but it's relatively trivial for a spammer to compensate by multiplying his output by 10, or by multiplying his spectrum of offers by 10, etc.\r\n\r\nYou'd have to depress the response rate to damn near zero for this approach to work. I don't think that's a likely outcome.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tsh3","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165419836,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11590-1fd63427-dced-4d2d-87ae-10d73ba16668-1566236761"}

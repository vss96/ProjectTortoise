All we need is to build the FACTORIES, which is a big initial cost, but then the cost of oil from coal (which we have RIDICULOUS amounts of) from those factories will be around what we have been paying.\r\n\r\nIn other words, in the long run, UNLESS CO2 is taxed, oil prices will go up slowly, but not orders of magnitude higher as predicted by peak oil, because as we techies know, engineers can do WONDERS with money!","link_id":"t3_tyxw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14143-dd8fe80e-e788-4582-b524-8fcc2c9a538f-1566236762"}

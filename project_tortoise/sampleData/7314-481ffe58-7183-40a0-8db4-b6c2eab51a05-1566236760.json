And also that most likely Quran/Islam does not preach them. But how do you explain the fact:\r\n\r\n1. that in todays world most such things are associated with Muslims.\r\n\r\n2. why educated muslims always say that this is un-islamic rathar than accepting that muslims do and and should stop doing it. It does not matter whether Islam approves it or not. Esp. because I think Islam or any other religion would not approve of any stupid thing. People like you actually create a sensation that associate it with Islam rather than Muslims. Hindus have problems and obviously hinduism has nothing to do with them but you will never find hindus putting their entire energy of proving that its un-Hindu. Look at your comment. It says that this bad practice is not associated with Muslims alone. And that most muslims dont do this. And if they do it a little bit its for positive reasons (enhance sexual pleasure). Nowhere do you accept that muslims are only people in todays world who do it so much. And that how muslims should stop doing it and how this ban or some other things can help. Denying problems wont solve them.\r\n\r\n3.How within India Muslims are becoming more and more backward as compared to any other religious group. Discrimination does not seem to be a big reason. I worked for Muslim owners and for Non-muslims owners. With Muslim and non-muslim collegues. I could not see any kind of huge discrimination. Its the same level as people generally have faster personal friendship with people of their own state. And they generally push their own kind only. But does not mean that people discriminate against others. I never felt discrimination at all despite coming from a huge minority group. Also, why this discrimination affects only the Muslims and not other religious minorities. Although, Christians are more likely to be disliked than muslims becasue they are culturally less integrated. Hows that even they fare much better than Muslims. Today, Christians are dominating the politics 20 times more proportionately than muslims.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, blame games and problem denials, shouting and making others feel bad....these things wont help. Work on yourself that the way to Nirvana.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tk48","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165262631,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-7,"ups":-7,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7314-481ffe58-7183-40a0-8db4-b6c2eab51a05-1566236760"}

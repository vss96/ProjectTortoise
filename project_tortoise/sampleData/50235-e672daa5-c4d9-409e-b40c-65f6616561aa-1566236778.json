Maintaining a constant velocity and position is not easy to do and without a large margin of error the tether would bring the satellite out of orbit quite easily.\r\n\r\nThis concept is relying on a fixed and laser straight structure traveling dozens (if not hundreds) of miles. Yet our everyday buildings have a built in flexibility to them, because otherwise they would snap in the first gale. So how would we maintain a rigid structure without any variance over much greater distances?\r\n\r\nThese are just two things that immediately come to mind to hopefully everyone.\r\n\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809375,"gilded":0,"id":"cw0ep","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw07q","author":"aletoledo","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50235-e672daa5-c4d9-409e-b40c-65f6616561aa-1566236778"}

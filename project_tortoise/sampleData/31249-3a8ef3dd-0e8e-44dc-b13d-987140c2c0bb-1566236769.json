Rarely in other languages can you turn off some kind of major piece of functionality with a configuration setting. You can't turn off Java.net.* in Java with a setting but for some reason it's a good idea in PHP.\r\n\r\nThat is just ridiculous. Java.net.* does a lot more than allow you to interact with remote files. Why is the ability to access files on another server as though they were local such a big deal? So you have to go through a little bit of indirection, boo hoo. Remote includes are a retarded idea to begin with, and security is not the only reason.\r\n\r\n&gt; Certainly it was a much bigger problem when register_globals was the default but those days are gone.\r\n\r\nThat register_globals even *exists* makes the ability to include a remote script a horrible security idea. Even though it is off there are still a lot of sites out there that require it.","link_id":"t3_uvnj","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166212796,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31249-3a8ef3dd-0e8e-44dc-b13d-987140c2c0bb-1566236769"}

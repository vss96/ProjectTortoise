Making the bridge go up and down may be a serious business with more complexities and details to attend to than an ignorant bystander (like me) knows about, but it certainly doesn't appear to be the sort of thing that requires lightning reflexes. How drunk/stoned do you have to be to screw it up so comprehensively?\r\n\r\nAh, there's some more info [here](http://www.boatnerd.com/windoc/), and a link to [a TSB report](http://bst.gc.ca/en/reports/marine/2001/m01c0054/m01c0054.asp):\r\n\r\n&gt;On 11 August 2001, the operator was on his scheduled day off and had completed two 12-hour day shifts during the previous two days. **The operator took two Darvon-N tablets** at approximately 0800 that morning to relieve back pain **and had consumed between two and four glasses of wine** around lunch time. Between 1300 and 1400, he received a telephone call from an SLSMC team leader, who asked if the operator would agree to work an overtime shift that evening on Bridge 11. The bridge operator agreed. ... After the telephone call, **the operator relaxed, ate, and tried to get some sleep but did not sleep.**\r\n\r\nDrugs, alcohol, and sleep deprivation. Not a good combo.","controversiality":0,"score":23,"ups":23,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165775444,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cucdj","parent_id":"t1_cuc8m","author":"Lagged2Death","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808236,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20453-c60d6e3f-7be6-4064-b348-937e6eee1123-1566236765"}

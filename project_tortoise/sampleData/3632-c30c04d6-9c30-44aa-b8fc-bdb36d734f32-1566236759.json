The thumbnails on this site used to be very unreliable (not sure who provided the service), but things are much smoother with the snap previews.  Hope these guys have enough money to keep paying for all the bandwidth.\r\n\r\nOne annoyance, this site is basically like originalsignal or popurls, gets there headlines from rss feeds.  Well snap preview seems to like putting the url in the preview box, which for an rss feed often looks pretty darn ugly.\r\n\r\nAnyone know how to hack around that ?  I have snap plugged into one of my projects but have release it yet because of these ugly urls.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_td8h","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807577,"distinguished":null,"author":"baba2006","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctd93","parent_id":"t3_td8h","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3632-c30c04d6-9c30-44aa-b8fc-bdb36d734f32-1566236759"}

You are building your argument upon abstractions that have no basis in reality.\r\n\r\nThere is no legal contract that binds society into the form of a state. The name 'social contract' is just a metaphor - there is no actual contract. At least, no contract that bears any resemblance to the kind of contracts that we sign and follow every day.\r\n\r\nDid the 'social contracts' of previous years bind the serfs to the feudal lords? The comerades to the communist state of the USSR? The citizens of a fascist government to their dictator?\r\n\r\nI do not believe you'd be willing to grant this, but these conclusions follow from your arguments.","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473808523,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_curlk","edited":false,"id":"curnx","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoFixedAbode","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28001-fa4c8dd7-202a-438a-980a-5ef56200531f-1566236768"}

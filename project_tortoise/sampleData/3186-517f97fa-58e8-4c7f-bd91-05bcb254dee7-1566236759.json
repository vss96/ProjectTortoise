So I wrote a program in Perl that gathers a lot of different information from biological databases, analyses it statistically and then produces a ranking of candidate genes that I predict are most likely to be involved in the hereditary disease.)\r\n\r\nWhile writing my thesis, I noticed I sometimes didn't have enough knowledge of things like algorithms, complexity,... so know I'm in the process of completing a second Masters degree, now in Computer Science, via Open University (self-study).\r\n\r\nAt the same time I'm working full time for a global information technology consulting company (for the moment still in a non-programming department, but I hope to chance that soon). The goal is to get some work experience here and when I have my second degree to start jobhunting for a real bioinformatician position at eg. a startup or in a university.\r\n\r\nI do most of my programming in Python and Ruby nowadays, but  spurred by the articles I read here, I try to expand my knowledge of lisp, Haskell, Erlang and J.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t9kv","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807556,"author":"BioGeek","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctc2l","parent_id":"t1_cta7e","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3186-517f97fa-58e8-4c7f-bd91-05bcb254dee7-1566236759"}

A mechanism can be described as \"choosing\" a path, despite not having any actual intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, natural selection \"chooses\" an evolutionary path by the mechanism of other paths dying.  No intelligent mind required.\r\n\r\nA computer is a good example.  A human being can write a computer program with very, very simple rules, so in one sense the *human* has \"chosen\" the outcomes.  But yet, totally unpredictable, unintended, *emergent* results can come from such programs.  At that point, it becomes useful to refer to the program itself as its own \"agent\", even if we recognize that it lacks true intelligence.  We just use those words as a convenience to facilitate understanding.\r\n\r\n&gt; The thing is, hot air always rises and magnets are always attracted to each other (or not). There is no second pathway that could be followed in these circumstances. I think there is a difference between using a word like \"want\" in a situation where there is only one possible outcome, and using a word like \"choose\" in a situation where there is more than one possible outcome.\r\n\r\nEvolution always chooses the fittest genes.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166987495,"score":9,"ups":9,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvxjt","id":"cvxlf","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"DavidSJ","retrieved_on":1473809323,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48805-0264f342-901b-4e1a-b838-1b1bb0b69fe2-1566236777"}

Something like this:\r\n\r\n    def foo():\r\n        global x\r\n        x, y = frob()\r\n\r\ndoes not readily translate to the separate syntax approach.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t1qf","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1233-73e5e798-51e5-4344-b1c6-094fbffcd73e-1566236758"}

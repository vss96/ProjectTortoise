{"body":"Yanno, it seems to me that for every one person who had wonderful service from company X, 10 people had crap service.  I just don't think computer manufacturers are trying very hard in that category.  That's why I haven't bought a computer in 5 years...I just buy the parts and assemble it myself.  Sure, I can't beat Dell's prices, but I *can* ensure that each and every part I buy is a quality part from a reputable company with known-to-be good RMA policies.  Plus, I don't have to pay out the ass for replacements if it's over 3 years old, and I don't have to buy a whole new computer every 2 - 3 years, I just upgrade pieces as necessary.","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_wd3v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167421353,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"oditogre","id":"cwdyq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wd3v","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809632,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57316-3e7d23a1-a6a0-4654-8bd7-85f57d36478e-1566236779"}

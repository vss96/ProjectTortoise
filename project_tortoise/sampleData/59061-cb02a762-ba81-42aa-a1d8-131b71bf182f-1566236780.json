{"body":"It's PBS pieces like this that make me think PBS should be 100% listener supported.  It's a political opinion piece that's being underwritten by federal tax dollars. I don't have a problem with PBS having a political viewpoint - I just don't think taxpayers should be asked to underwrite it. It's just as much a misuse of tax money as the White House paying journalists to support NCLB.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wh7i","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167513336,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-8,"ups":-8,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nobodyspecial","parent_id":"t3_wh7i","id":"cwhic","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809697,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59061-cb02a762-ba81-42aa-a1d8-131b71bf182f-1566236780"}

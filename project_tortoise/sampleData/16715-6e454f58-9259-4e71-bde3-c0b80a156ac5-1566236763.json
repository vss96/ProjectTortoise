These are people whose entire job centers around thinking in dollars. They probably haven't had units matter in any work they've done since high school. So units don't exist any more. By now, they conceive of cents as just meaning \"two decimal places\". Why else would that woman make the comment about \".002 dollars\" not existing? How else do you explain the man not knowing the difference between \".002 dollars\" and \".002 cents\", even though he recognizes \"half a dollar\" (.5) is different than \"half a cent\" (.005)?","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808108,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cu5jm","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu4vx","author":"dustmop","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16715-6e454f58-9259-4e71-bde3-c0b80a156ac5-1566236763"}

{"body":"&gt; Not everyone agrees on what human rights are.\r\n\r\nWrong. Everyone agrees what they are. If they didn't, they wouldn't be human rights. There's quite a few people that don't recognize human rights, usually Americans are like that because of their indoctrination in an obsolete 17th century moral philosophy, but even those people can put 2 + 2 = 4.\r\n\r\n&gt; Some people think there is an inherent right to economic equality, I do not. \r\n\r\nYou're American. You people are all backwards.\r\n\r\n&gt; Everyone is justified in his own mind\r\n\r\nIf that's the only standard you go by then you're pretty pathetic.\r\n\r\n&gt; I do not think there is anything wrong with that, no matter how you slice it.\r\n\r\nThere is something wrong with it. It would never happen so it's useless bullshit. The last time such usurious rates of interest were charged was before modern banking was invented. And in that context, there WAS something wrong with it.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t66j","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165013551,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"richardkulisz","id":"ctagt","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct8vh","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807526,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2350-667964ef-c64f-4ca7-88ea-f844f3ff26f7-1566236758"}

It’s a full application development platform, based on a fast runtime engine and virtual machine. It offers advanced, modern features, including Just-in-Time compilation, the “sandbox” security model and automated memory management. It supports multiple programming languages and it isn’t tied to any one processor. Best of all, it’s fully open source.\"\r\n\r\nMono is not the first environment to support all this on Linux.\r\n\r\nAnd Mono is not dead, nor does this article give any reason Mono might be dead; instead it is about the open-sourcing of Java. So the author is just trying to get extra clicks from Mono zealots.

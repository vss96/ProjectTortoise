Polk; my understanding was the guy was considered fifth behind George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Thomas Jefferson. He:\r\n\r\n1.

Has a They Might be Giants song about him\r\n\r\nThen again, the article talks about presidential preferences shifting through time; perhaps presidents that start unconstitutional wars will be seen less favorably from here on out.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tegi","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165154568,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"author":"danteembermage","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tegi","id":"ctg2o","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807632,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4914-bd3174a6-0e96-4307-8798-67712a1aa7bf-1566236759"}

They solve the problem of 'uncanny alley' by implanting incredibly tiny motion capture sensors into the skin of professional actors and actresses. We're talking about going from 80 points of motion capture used in Tony Hawk 1 to something like 10,000 points (its sci fi).\r\n\r\nIf not 10 years, imagine 50 years out. Even just doing it for a few archetypes could lead to highly convincing video.\r\n\r\nOf course, the law is on the side of the person who's likeness was stolen. Your digital image is actually owned by you (and can be sold) and thus, protected by copyright. So celebrities would be able to at least sue people making and distributing 'celebrity sex tapes' for profit.","link_id":"t3_qg8o","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166211757,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"redrobot5050","id":"cuy93","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cqoka","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808646,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31219-f3d3826e-2d08-4739-87c4-883a953a5511-1566236769"}

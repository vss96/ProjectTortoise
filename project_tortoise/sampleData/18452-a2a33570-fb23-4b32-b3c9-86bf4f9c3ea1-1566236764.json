My point was that he has \"courage\" in the light of that.  The courage of the herd.  If you want to say, fine, but they're not a \"mob\" because they're not brandishing pitchforks and torches, that's fine with me.\r\n\r\n&gt;\"crime\".... er, what crime?\r\n\r\nIs robbery not a crime where you come from? It is where I come from.\r\n\r\nIt also is on the campus of UCLA.\r\n\r\n&gt;\"intimidate\".... casually - and I mean casually taking the guys case...or are you thinking of the word \"motherfucker\"?.... this has to go down as one of the least intimidating intonations of that particular word ever!\r\n\r\nWhen the man said not to steal his case or he would call the police, the professor essentially responded, yeah, call the police, they're gonna believe me and my mob, not you.\r\n\r\nThat's classic intimidation.\r\n\r\n&gt;how you got marked up beats me!\r\n\r\nHow you see a guy getting robbed and wonder \"what crime?\" is beyond me.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u6la","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808165,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Glaxnor","id":"cu8lt","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu7fy","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18452-a2a33570-fb23-4b32-b3c9-86bf4f9c3ea1-1566236764"}

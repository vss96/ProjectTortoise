Rape, in those cases, clearly is a crime of violence. But what about \"rape\" in which two naive young adults get intoxicated and have sex without clear consent? \r\n\r\nEsp. in Illinois, all \"sex crimes\" get pretty much lumped together with a \"sex offender\" label. So a guy who accidentally exposed himself to someone while urinating on a dumpster can share the same stigma as a violent paedophile. That's messed up. \r\n\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55843-48c1a4da-2a8a-44ef-bbaf-0f8fb8f08675-1566236779"}

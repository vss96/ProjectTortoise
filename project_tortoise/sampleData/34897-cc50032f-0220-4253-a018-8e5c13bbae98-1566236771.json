{"controversiality":0,"body":"Tonga used to have a population density of 250/km when the west first discovered it, however thanks to 'civilisation' we ended up being the reason of death for most of them from disease. Explaining why it has a population density of 150/km.  That was over 200 years ago and well before any form of medicine was in good use, although they could have used medicinal herbs I doubt they would have the life span that people do today meaning a much larger population turnover with the bulk population being in the youth. At times in england it was common for families to have 5 children and only 3 make it till adulthood.\r\n\r\nDoing the figures it would have had a population of around 166,000 (roughly) and it has been known in history that kings would institute a first right policy. Considering that, it would be quite easy to do.","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v5hk","subreddit":"science","score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1166406386,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cv5qe","id":"cv5vv","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808791,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34897-cc50032f-0220-4253-a018-8e5c13bbae98-1566236771"}

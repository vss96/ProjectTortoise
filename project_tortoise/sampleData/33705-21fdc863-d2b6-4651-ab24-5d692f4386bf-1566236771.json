Compare all the \"solutions\" here with the regexp version, which in Perl would boil down to `!m/[^A-Za-z0-9-._]/` even without the extra features Perl provides for shortcutting just such a comparison.  Note that the regexp works by seeing if any non-alphanumeric character exists, not by checking that every character is alphanumeric; this is just an efficiency improvement, but the use of regexps is what really matters.\r\n\r\nRegexps are overused, yes; but if your *only* excuse for avoiding them in a simple case is that you think they're too hard to understand, then you're glorying in your own ignorance and you should be ashamed of yourself.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_v35v","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808750,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv37v","id":"cv3ni","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33705-21fdc863-d2b6-4651-ab24-5d692f4386bf-1566236771"}

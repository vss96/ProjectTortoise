{"controversiality":0,"body":"Yeah, I have been reading strongtalk papers and studying up on garbage collection and other such relevant topics recently. I really enjoy ruby (the language), so I thought, \"Heck, maybe I can take a look at the interpreter and maybe muck around a bit\". Well, for those who aren't aware, it is in all C with a huge reliance on the preprocessor. It wouldn't be too tricky to make new methods or tweak existing ones, but any non-trivial change just looked like more effort than it was worth.\r\n\r\nDon't enough people have access to a decent C++ compiler and STL to say, \"Hey, we can build languages in C++ now.\"?\r\n\r\nIf ruby were being written in haskell, SML, or Ocaml, it would be my hobby. Heck, I'd probably play with it if it were in C++. However, since it is written in C, the pain/\"getting to do fun things\" ratio is just too high for me. I'm really glad that there are others for whom that doesn't hold true.\r\n\r\nLanguage nerds enjoy implementing languages. Language nerds dislike using C where it isn't needed. I honestly believe that if a skilled and motivated person started a promising ruby implementation in a modern language, they'd have no trouble finding help. It happened with pugs, and I'd say ruby is quite a bit less complicated and better understood than perl6.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uqnu","subreddit":"programming","ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1166224016,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"doubtingthomas","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuz3a","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuuh2","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808663,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31615-b7f7b6ca-5e55-4a4a-8966-2e0e6c6b5ece-1566236770"}

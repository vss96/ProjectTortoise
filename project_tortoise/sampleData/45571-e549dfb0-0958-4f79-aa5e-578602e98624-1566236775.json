{"body":"Anyone who fantasized that a 1300 year old blood feud between Sunnis and Sh'ias would be solved by deposing a brutal government followed by military occupation for a year or two and adding democracy is severely mentally handicapped.  \r\n\r\nIraq is proof if GWB's complete and total inability to make foreign policy decisions of any kind, and history will only record him as the instigator of the Iraq civil war, since that's the only thing he accomplished during his two terms in office.  Brilliant politician, idiot leader.\r\n\r\nThere are now only four likely outcomes of GWB's involvement in Iraq:\r\n\r\n1) A mix of Sunnis and Sh'ias, and a government as brutal as Sadam's was, democratic or not.\r\n\r\n2) Ethnic cleansing will take its course, with a country predominantly made up of either Sh'ias or Sunnis, and a brutal government to keep things in place, democratic or not.\r\n\r\n3) In the case of (1) or (2), the Kurds, faced with a certain holocaust against them in any event, fight a real war of survival to the last person.  They have everything to gain, and nothing to lose.\r\n\r\n4) A failed nation state.  With lots of oil.\r\n\r\nThat will be the contribution of George W. Bush to history.\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vnwr","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166805071,"author":"bithead","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_vnwr","edited":false,"id":"cvr8p","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809202,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45571-e549dfb0-0958-4f79-aa5e-578602e98624-1566236775"}

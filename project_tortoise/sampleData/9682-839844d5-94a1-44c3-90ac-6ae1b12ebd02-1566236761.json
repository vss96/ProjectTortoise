Mine gives me 2 articles I've read, maybe one other that I'd like to read, and the rest is basically junk.  Compare that to the programming reddit hotlist, where I read almost all of them.  Or even the programming reddit newlist, where I read a good 50%.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether the problem is just not enough effort being put into it, or whether the concept of a recommendation engine is fundamentally flawed (Amazon's is the best I know of, and only somewhat useful).  Academic research on recommendations suggests that people's friends are actually *poor* predictors of their tastes: your much better off finding an expert in the domain and asking for their opinion than asking for your friends' opinions.  And there's a further problem in that people read things to learn stuff they didn't know before.  Simple Bayesian clustering will result in lots of little cliques that all like the same things, but they won't stretch any of the members with *new* perspectives.  Good for groupthink, bad for interesting news.\r\n\r\n","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165348390,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctqll","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctqj1","author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807829,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9682-839844d5-94a1-44c3-90ac-6ae1b12ebd02-1566236761"}

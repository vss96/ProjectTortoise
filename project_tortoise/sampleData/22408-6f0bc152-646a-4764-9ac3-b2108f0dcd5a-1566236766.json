For example, a trading strategy that makes 10% on odd years and loses 9.0909...% on even years has the exact same average expected payoff as one that makes 50% on odd years and loses 33% on even years (zero).  However, the former case nets a hedge fund 1% a year (plus any asset-based fee), while the latter case nets them 5% a year.","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22408-6f0bc152-646a-4764-9ac3-b2108f0dcd5a-1566236766"}

After all... I never really consented...\r\n\r\nWhat about if we're both drunk?  If this law only applies to females, then the male could be convicted of rape - even if he's more intoxicated than the girl.\r\n\r\nAt what point is it rape?  What about the girl who has sex at a party after a few drinks, and regrets it the morning after?  Can she charge the male for rape?  What about after 2 drinks? 1 drink?  Where's the line drawn?\r\n\r\nHow does the guy even know how drunk the girl is?  Will guys be responsible for giving girls breathalyzer tests before having sex? \r\n\r\nHow could the cops possibly \"backdate\" to determine how intoxicated she originally was?  From what I understand, alcohol is processed differently, based on the person and condition.  Are the police really going to factor in what she ate?\r\n\r\nSeems like there's just too many questions for this to be enforced fairly.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wa4w","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167370151,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56300-841900a2-5c06-49a8-8011-a7c1f0a9aefb-1566236779"}

So, to put it more formally: \"I feel more comfortable by optimizing the usefulness/induced_suffering ratio my actions are causing, according to some metrics I'm not able to--and don't really care to--define precisely\".\r\n\r\nAmong the elements that influence my usefulness, there are: gustative pleasure, health(1), habits, convinience, cultural identity...\r\n\r\nAbout suffering, the most striking disagreement I have with PETA-esque people is their issue with slaugthering. I disagree with \"animals suffer because we kill them\". I partially agree with \"animals (including *homo sapiens*) suffer because they die\". Since I'm extremely confident that  \"life eventually implies death, and vice-versa\", the former sentence is equivalent to \"animals suffer because they live\". And the only fix to that situation would be to nuke the planet with all its sentient beings, which seems like a rather bad idea to me.\r\n\r\n(1) I know some people believe that eating meat is unhealthy, whatever the quantities and the corresponding lifestyle. Some studies support it, some support the opposite; I have the strong feeling that the formers are tainted with more ideological bends than the latters. Until provided with a conclusive demonstration of one of these hypotheses, I choose to believe that meat eating in reasonnable quantities is a rather healthy choice.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166962894,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvttf","edited":false,"id":"cvwsr","author":"fab13n","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809307,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48421-4b2e22e5-0513-4fbc-990a-a77b773b8e91-1566236777"}

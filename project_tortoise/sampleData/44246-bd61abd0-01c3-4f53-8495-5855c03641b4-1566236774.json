Saul had persecuted Christians until being blinded and told that he was persecuting witnesses to the truth.  Eyewitnesses to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus were willing to die rather than deny the truth.  Now that two millenia have passed you can deny any of the people ever existed and suggest it was an elaborate fraud, but that explanation has plenty of holes.  Whether you like it or not, Christianity changed the course of civilization and ushered in a new age.","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_vnhg","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809149,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"degustibus","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvobn","id":"cvoio","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44246-bd61abd0-01c3-4f53-8495-5855c03641b4-1566236774"}

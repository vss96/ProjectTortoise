People complain that the site changed once 'stupid american kids' came.\r\n\r\nPeople don't seem to realize that the most popular things at a site like digg or reddit are those that will be common to the most people.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason that we've seen reddit's front page change with less articles about lisp and more stupid images from 7 years ago.  Its not because there are more stupid people here, its because there are more people here.  More people enjoy laughing at dumb pictures than enjoy learning about seeminly obscure programming languages.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvsi","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13138-c1f9e745-fbb0-4aa0-844c-496efba8c95c-1566236762"}

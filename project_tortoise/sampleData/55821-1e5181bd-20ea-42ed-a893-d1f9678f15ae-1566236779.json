If the code *needs* to be rewritten and yet organizationally this is impossible, then failure is guaranteed.\r\n\r\n* I guess you could say that \"well-written\" implies \"bug-free\", but what I meant was well designed code in an appropriate language and platform, implemented using good practices, etc.  Usually, for me, the bugs in code produced this way are relatively rare, and are mostly tractable at the level of source code.\r\n\r\n* Yes, this sounds like a bad situation and I'd try to avoid languages with these traits.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w55v","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55821-1e5181bd-20ea-42ed-a893-d1f9678f15ae-1566236779"}

I would guess these would be the \"very religious\".\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the percentage of \"very religious\" (13%) is slightly smaller than the percentage who don't think faith causes tension(16%).\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder where the crossover is here.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vtxd","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809265,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dublinclontarf","id":"cvuml","parent_id":"t3_vtxd","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47340-0ef73d84-72d7-45fa-8d19-e78fe5028fbe-1566236775"}

It's not at all to belittle any of the bad things happening in the US, which are genuinely cause for concern and protest.\r\n\r\nIt's a grey area but I'd rather err on the side of caution than simply capitulate my rights out of fear or worse out of some perverse accommodation to big brother. As an American I was trained from birth to be suspicious (if not outright hostile) to anyone who wants to erode my rights. \r\n\r\nYou see, rights are a finite resource. Government, corporations and the individual compete for control of this limited pool of rights. Assigning rights to one logically relieves those rights from control of the other two.  \r\n\r\nSo... with 200+ years of hard fought gains in rights for the individual as my background I'm very resistant to giving up any of my slice of pie to either government or corporations.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wbwh","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1167424278,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57427-ee1cab30-2dec-4911-97e8-e28c31aff24c-1566236779"}

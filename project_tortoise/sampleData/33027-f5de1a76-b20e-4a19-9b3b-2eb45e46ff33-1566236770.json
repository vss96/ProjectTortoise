{"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uzuc","controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; Java is a much more simply language compared to Haskell. It has less abstractions, a less sophisticated type system and also is much more bound to the underlying execution model of the processor.\r\n\r\nI disagree with that quite a bit. Haskell can be summed up in one page. Now some people might have a difficult time grasping monads and some of the more advanced features, but Haskell itself is a rather simple language with quite a bit of power.\r\n\r\nYes, it is more abstract and has more abstractions than Java, but that is the point of programming language - to code in a language that humans can understand first and computers second. So what if Haskell does a lot of complicated stuff when compiling? That doesn't concern me.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166313701,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cv2cx","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv2ai","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808725,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33027-f5de1a76-b20e-4a19-9b3b-2eb45e46ff33-1566236770"}

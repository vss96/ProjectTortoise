I was raised a fundamentalist, and all of my extended family are fundamentalist Christians. I was an extremely devout Christian up until my high school band director died. I thought he was the best guy in the world, but he was Jewish. My parents took me to his funeral, and I sat there contemplating the fact that by our standards, he was burning in hell as we sat there and celebrated the good that he had done in his life. I considered the fact that his family undoubtedly believed he was in heaven. I briefly tried to weigh those options, and quickly realized that there was no good reason to seriously consider either of those possibilities. At that very moment, something clicked and I became an atheist. 7 years or so later and I'm still in what I like to call the \"atheist closet\" because of the pain my family would go through if they found out that someday I'll be going to hell.","retrieved_on":1473809752,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cwkfi","parent_id":"t3_wkal","author_flair_text":null,"author":"dannyhw","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60580-caa56d3b-1722-449b-9505-3992cb8f6953-1566236780"}

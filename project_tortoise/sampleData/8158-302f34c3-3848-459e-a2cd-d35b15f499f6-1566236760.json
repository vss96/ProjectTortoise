We've lived with single core CPUs for years.  That's not exactly parallel.  This concept allows kernel tasks to run in parallel.  You also don't provide sufficient argument for why fast cores would have to wait on the kernel core (the kernel core is not the only core that can enter the kernel!).\r\n\r\nAlso, nothing about the concept requires high performance cores from waiting on the slower one.  The cores are ISA compatible and the fast cores can run kernel code as well (particularly when required by a system call), they just don't handle routine interrupts.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807765,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctn7v","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctmy7","author":"zetta","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8158-302f34c3-3848-459e-a2cd-d35b15f499f6-1566236760"}

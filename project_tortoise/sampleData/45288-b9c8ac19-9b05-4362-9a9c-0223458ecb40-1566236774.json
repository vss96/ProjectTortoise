Nice that somebody points that out. But you try to sell free-competition as fun thing to all. It is not. \r\n\r\nIllegal immigrants bring average salary down. They are responsible for two or three jobs or for the overtime you have to have. I'm capitalist to the teeth and would have it no other way. But I'm honest capitalist. Capitalism means competition. USA is really competitive in traditional labor.  Average American earns less than average American 1960 did. They also work more and harder now. No much free time if you want to be rich. Unfortunately India and China are more competitive because they work for less. Scandinavian countries like Finland and Sweden are more competitive countries in higher paying high-tech jobs because their better education. American kids should be working their ass of in school and learn to write and do math and other hard to learn subjects. Their middle class parents should spend less leisure time, exercise more, save money, ditch TV and work more, because either they work for less money or work is moving to other countries. Illegal immigrants are just the short time solution to American business before they give the jobs to robots or move them abroad. \r\n\r\nCapitalism is not meant to be fun. If competition really works, you must work your ass off for your whole life. This is the real capitalism.\r\n\r\nAmerican dream of rich and luxury life is always just for the small group of the people who are much better than others. Everybody should have right to try to get there, but all should not be allowed to enter. Any other thinking makes us sloppy.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809191,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvqny","parent_id":"t1_cvq0t","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45288-b9c8ac19-9b05-4362-9a9c-0223458ecb40-1566236774"}

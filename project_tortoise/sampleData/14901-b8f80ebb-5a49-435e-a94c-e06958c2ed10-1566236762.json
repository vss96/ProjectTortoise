The math may not be an optimal path to the solution, but the whole point of math is that as long as you stay within the rules of the mathematics, your solution is valid.\r\n\r\nIt's an absurd example, but dividing by zero is an absurd idea to begin with.\r\n\r\nIf I solve the follow equation in the following absurd way, you might consider it \"bad math\" but it's still *right*.\r\n\r\n    16a = 32\r\n    16a/2 = 32/2\r\n    8a = 16\r\n    8a/2 = 16/2\r\n    4a = 8\r\n    4a/2 = 8/2\r\n    2a = 4\r\n    2a/2 = 4/2\r\n    a = 2\r\n\r\nThe only wrong thing he did was allowing -a/a when a might be zero. Because dividing by zero is not a valid number. Which is the whole point he was trying to illustrate.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808039,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cu1vy","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu1ui","author":"cecilkorik","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14901-b8f80ebb-5a49-435e-a94c-e06958c2ed10-1566236762"}

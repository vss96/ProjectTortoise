Gibson made a film called \"Payback\" or something that was a totally pathetic rip-off of a really great earlier film called \"Point Blank\"(of course, there was no credit given to the earlier film, even though the remake was entirely based on the plot).  \"Point Blank\" starrred Lee Marvin in a really memorable performance, far beyond anything Gibson is capable of.  \r\n\r\nI don't go to Gibson movies ever since they turned incredibly violent. Gibson is a pretty boy, an OK comic actor, but seems to have this incredible love for sado-masochism which he wants to inflict on the world in the name of religion or epic or something.

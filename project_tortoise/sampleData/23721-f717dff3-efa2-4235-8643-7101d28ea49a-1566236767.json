No more than a few thousand IIRC.\r\n\r\nRegarding the sustained consistency, there's mountains of evidence that it's not environmental. Even if it's sensitive to environmental factors, they wouldn't play a very large role. So that leaves either genetics, heredity or purely stochastic processes.\r\n\r\nIf it's genetic then it should be successfully attacked with genomics. It's just a question of time until someone comes up with a chip for all known brain-related genes. Sifting through all their alleles to build such a chip would be excruciating but once finished it's just number crunching.\r\n\r\nUnless the number of genes is a large factor? Do you know if detecting gene number is being worked on? And I would dearly like to know how much RNA rewriting complicates the picture.\r\n\r\nThe thing that could really push back progress would be if it's caused by stochastic processes. This would suck to say the least.","retrieved_on":1473808349,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cui44","id":"cuib2","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"richardkulisz","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23721-f717dff3-efa2-4235-8643-7101d28ea49a-1566236767"}

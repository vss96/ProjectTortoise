It is quite easy to avoid the problem, though. \r\n\r\nIf someone has a 50% chance of guessing correctly each time he/she hears a nurse telling what she sees, it is simply a question of adding enough nurses. Without doing any calculations, my hunch tells me that 60 would be more than enough. \r\n\r\nOnly one in a billion billions would choose the right alternative every time if the chances were 50% at each attempt. Thus, if a person scores close to 60, he/she posesses some skill that increases the probability of guessing correctly to more that 50%.\r\n","link_id":"t3_t7nm","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2313-deaf1ff9-9778-4fb8-998f-7e5d4e2c7e8f-1566236758"}

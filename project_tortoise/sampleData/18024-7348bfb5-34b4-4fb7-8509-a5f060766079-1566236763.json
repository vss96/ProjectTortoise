When I tried to buy one at the dollar store down the street, the cashier tried to card me (I've got a rather wild &amp; out of control goatee, I definitely don't look underage) and I called shenanigans. \"There is no such law on the books,\" said I, but the cashier insisted. I put the lighter back on the display (it was the only thing I'd gone in for) and informed them that I refused to shop at a store that blatantly lies to their customers. Haven't been back since.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u5p4","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808149,"distinguished":null,"author":"xinhoj","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cu6ek","edited":false,"id":"cu7n9","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"18024-7348bfb5-34b4-4fb7-8509-a5f060766079-1566236763"}

These guys are way too consumer savy.  Plus, they're advertising geniuses.  They will find a way to revive their sales.  It's true that CD's have seriously dropped in price.

If Apple is smart, they'll answer with a better wifi music sharing scheme.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ujny","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24930-86cbc741-fe09-42f9-bb6d-0d45726b3ffc-1566236767"}

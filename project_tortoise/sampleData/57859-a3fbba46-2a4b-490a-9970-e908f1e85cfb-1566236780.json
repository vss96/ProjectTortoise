All you have is desert and a small town. Lots of sand, I was there to see. And I was also in Dubai. I guess it's a matter of taste after all, but it was definitely exciting. So many people, so much stuff to do- malls, rides, safaris, the hotels, the people. Not boring at all.\r\n\r\nThough, I'm handing that to you, Beirut is probably the most exciting and lively city in the Middle East. I don't know what it's like after this summer's bombings, but before that, it was a glorious place, full of people and culture and fun to have.","created_utc":1167437847,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cwdos","id":"cwevd","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"seraskywalker","retrieved_on":1473809649,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57859-a3fbba46-2a4b-490a-9970-e908f1e85cfb-1566236780"}

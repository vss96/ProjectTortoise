In fact, I would be surprised to find a principled libertarian theorist who didn't at least pay lip service to the idea. All an anarchist does, is extend the graph of theory through the zero. Any is bad, less is better, and so surely none must be best? The question is less \"should we?\" but \"how to make it work?\"\r\n\r\nThere are of course a lot of electoral pragmatist or emotive libertarians, who probably haven't considered anarchism, or would dismiss it as impractical without any deep thought. Plus there are many principled libertarians who say \"get back to me on that after we've first regained the minimal state set out in our supposed constitution\".","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808790,"gilded":0,"id":"cv5si","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv5g6","author":"JulianMorrison","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34843-f0ae8983-d030-4a66-86b6-45dd96ad3cc7-1566236771"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"My problem with the essay is that it's not clear who this essay is intended for.  If anyone has taken aesthetics 101 or read Kant's Critique of Judgement (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Judgment -- read the fourth paragraph of the Aesthetics section), then they have grappled with these issues. The idea that there must be a non-subjective component to taste is not really a revelation, although it is presented as if it were.  Is this supposed to be a personal story of how Mr. Graham came to this realization?  That might be interesting.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ufsk","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1165864703,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"wselman","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ufsk","id":"cugyq","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808322,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22946-31ec6d1f-778d-4122-81bb-c0ef863036d5-1566236766"}

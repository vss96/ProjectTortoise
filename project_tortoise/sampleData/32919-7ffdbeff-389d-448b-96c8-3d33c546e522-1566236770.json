Lucky girl to have travelled so widely. I wonder what awful pain of death she suffered while in Kenya that brought her to seek asylum? She must have done well at school to immediately be able to embark on a university course on arrival; I'd have given my eye teeth for that opportunity in the country I was born and raised. Though her sister is ten times more worrying, let's face it. A shocking account of everyday attitudes in the muslim world, reinforced by the recent \"Conference\". Sickening - that she thinks that if she hadn't had the benefit of a specific educational course in Holland, she would have had no way of knowing about the holocaust. If it's such an unknown in the arab world, why do they spend so much time denying it?","controversiality":1,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808721,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_v1y6","id":"cv255","edited":false,"author":"Sle","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32919-7ffdbeff-389d-448b-96c8-3d33c546e522-1566236770"}

The 360 beats it in some areas, and in other areas is beaten by it.  Regardless, the 360 is delivering better performance.\r\n\r\nWhat's really more powerful?  A 2x Bluray drive?  Or a 24x DVD drive?\r\n\r\nAs far as the Wii being the choice for creativity--I disagree.  The Wii is a failed concept.  The gyroscopic mouse is a million times better.  The Wiimote now works with Windows and OS X, and even the PS3.  I'm sure the 360 will follow.  Besides that, the PS3 and 360 both have incredible cameras which can sense motion and have much better opportunity for developer creativity than the Wiimote.\r\n\r\nPS3 is all hype.  The Wii is a gimmick with great marketing.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809253,"gilded":0,"id":"cvtxz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vtff","author":"erusan","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47073-1576fb2e-2c3c-4066-b4d7-7abe192b480b-1566236775"}

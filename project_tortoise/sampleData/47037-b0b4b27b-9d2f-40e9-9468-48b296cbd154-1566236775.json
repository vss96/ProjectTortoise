They have their own problems--**such as not reducing taxes.**\r\n\r\nYou are not dealing with reality here. Did you miss the massive Bush/Cheney tax cut packages of the last 6 years? And how can you have a more centrally planned economy, which is what socialism is all about, then having the centrally planned and funded military-industrial one Bush/Cheney has rebuilt over the last 6 years. In case you missed it we switched from a free market driven, no holds barred dot-com era, to one in which the monopolist corporate donor base of Bush/Cheney feed off the centrally controlled trough of public tax revenue.\r\n\r\nAny future vision of the US without a strong, funded competent, and transparent government is completely devoid of reality in this post-Katrina era. New Orleans demonstrated just how badly competent national government is needed in this modern era. It's not that taxes are bad, its how they are spent, which is why you want transparency and verifiability rather than Norquistian infantile imaginings where taxes don't exist. What you need is an active and directly engaged populace policing the politicians of all stripes. In short what the left blogsphere has been working to achieve, and what the modern progressive candidate is proposing.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vrfp","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47037-b0b4b27b-9d2f-40e9-9468-48b296cbd154-1566236775"}

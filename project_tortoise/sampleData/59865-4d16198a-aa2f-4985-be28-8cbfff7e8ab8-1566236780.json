For many watching the video will make it harder to buy into conspiracy theories suggesting he's still alive and will be restored to power.  Maybe Ahmadinejad will see the video and realize that Hussein at one point had far greater power but lived to see his two sons shot dead and face trial after pissing off Western governments for too long.  \r\n\r\nI have not seen the video and do not feel compelled to watch it.  The Daniel Pearl decapitation video I did watch.  For some avoiding unpleasant things that others have endured seems like self imposed childish ignorance while others realize the value of keeping the mind pure of vile imagery.  \r\n\r\nAs for Gandhi's quotation, most of us have two eyes, so blindness does not follow.  His quote fails the historical reality test.  An eye for an eye, at the time it was implemented, was a step towards reducing violence by setting limits to retribution and stifling escalating feuds.  In a pre-Christian world the notion that one would offer up suffering and resist the urge to retaliate goes against most human instincts.  When attacked the choices would seem to be fight or flight.  Losing an eye and doing nothing would seem to invite further attack.  \r\n\r\nAs for the wrongness of capital punishment, just about all critics of the death penalty can at least admit that there is a difference between society responding to a repeatedly violent offender and the perpetator's offences which elicit retribution.  Saddam Hussein is not an innocent victim.  He had many opportunities to avoid the noose.  The longer he lived the longer some would have plotted to free him in deadly raids.  He continued to cost Iraqis their lives during his trial for crimes against humanity.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59865-4d16198a-aa2f-4985-be28-8cbfff7e8ab8-1566236780"}

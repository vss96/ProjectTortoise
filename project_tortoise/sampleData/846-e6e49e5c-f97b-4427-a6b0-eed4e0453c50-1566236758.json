Also, anti-matter is created every day in large machines at research labs.  I guess that a spaceship making the intersolar journey would require a large amount of antimatter for fuel.\r\n\r\nThe current known methods to create antimatter use partical accellerators and incredible amounts of electricity.  I speculate that space-based solar power plants will be necessary to manufacture the antimatter fuel.  Lifting the power plant machinery off the planet, into space, will be very expensive.  It won't be practical with rockets.  We need a space elevator.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that a space elevator is the next step in the progress of human expansion.  Once we can affordably lift machines into space, all kinds of space industry will develop.  This industry will lead to interstellar space travel and extrasolar colonies.  I doubt that Dr.Hawking will see such advances.  I hope he can at least visit space and experience it once.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807468,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ct6hl","edited":false,"id":"ct7dw","author_flair_text":null,"author":"mleonhard","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"846-e6e49e5c-f97b-4427-a6b0-eed4e0453c50-1566236758"}

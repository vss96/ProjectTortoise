{"body":"I don't think that's true.  For one thing, there's no statement of authorship in the document itself.  In fact, it apparently incorporates an earlier C coding standards document from the auto industry (the MISRA guidelines for C).  Stroustrup does link to this JSF-AV document from his C++ page at ATT,[1] but he doesn't refer to it as his, in any way. (Compare that with how he refers to his own books and papers on that page.)\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.research.att.com/~bs/C++.html","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ubup","subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165849954,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"TomP","edited":false,"id":"cuful","parent_id":"t1_cuey4","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808302,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22360-f5f60227-1990-4cb9-8d85-2322263705b4-1566236766"}

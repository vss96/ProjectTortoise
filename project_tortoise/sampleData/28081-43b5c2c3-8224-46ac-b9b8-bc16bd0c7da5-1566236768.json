The Ruby Interpreter is rotting, not the Ruby Language- the two are quite different.  Ruby as a language is in no danger and is still quite beautiful (although I'm not happy with quite a few of the 1.9/2.0 decisions, but that's another rant).\r\n\r\nThe standard Ruby interpreter has been considered dead for quite awhile (at *least* a year), and for almost as long YARV has been termed the official replacement.  The process going on now is that the Ruby 1.9 code is being moved to a new repository, where the YARV code is already sitting there waiting for it.  So, reasonably soon they will start having semi-usable 1.9 releases using YARV, which at that point will be the official interpreter.  During this process the guy that wrote the YARV (Koichi), is finally going through and cleaning up all of his code so that it is suitable for the light of day.  The future viability of a standard Ruby interpreter lies in this process, which is happening RIGHT NOW.  So, really, it is too early to call any future standard Ruby interpreter \"dead\", or even \"rotting\".  ( [source](http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/yarvIsMerging.html)  )\r\n\r\nThat being said, I fully welcome competing interpreters.  I'll use whatever is fastest as long as it does, indeed, work.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166110130,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":10,"ups":10,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28081-43b5c2c3-8224-46ac-b9b8-bc16bd0c7da5-1566236768"}

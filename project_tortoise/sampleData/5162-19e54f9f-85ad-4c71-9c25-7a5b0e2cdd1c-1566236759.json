You could probably learn the fundamentals of music theory in a few hours and pick up the guitar technique in a few weeks.  (Playing chords is kinda hard at first because your fingers need to develop calluses and you keep damping strings accidentally.)  After that, it would just be a matter of memorizing the notes on the fretboard, or at least learning how to figure out what note a particular fret corresponds to on each string.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807644,"gilded":0,"id":"ctgp0","parent_id":"t1_ctge1","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5162-19e54f9f-85ad-4c71-9c25-7a5b0e2cdd1c-1566236759"}

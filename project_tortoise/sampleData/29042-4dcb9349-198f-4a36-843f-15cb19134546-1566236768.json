The problem isn't that teachers are inept or that schools are underfunded. The problem is that teachers spend all day dealing with discipline problems but have no way to punish the students. Detentions are never served and we took away the paddle years ago. Parents don't care what their kids are doing in school and don't reinforce the importance of education at home. Teachers' hands are tied and students don't want to learn. Let's place the blame where it belongs - on parents, students, and society.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"29042-4dcb9349-198f-4a36-843f-15cb19134546-1566236768"}

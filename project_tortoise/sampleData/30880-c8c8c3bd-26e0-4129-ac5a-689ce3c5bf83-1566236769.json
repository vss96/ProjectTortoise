To accept a 5 point increase in IQ *caused* by a vegetarian diet based solely on sampling statistics is IMO not sound reasoning.  Especially when you look at this quote from the article:\r\n\r\n&gt; There was no difference in IQ score between strict\r\n&gt; vegetarians and those who said they were vegetarian \r\n&gt; but who reported eating fish or chicken.\r\n\r\nSo just \"saying\" you live a vegetarian lifestyle gives you an IQ boost?  Or is it just the red meat that reduces your IQ?\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808633,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuw1c","edited":false,"id":"cuxll","author":"pdq","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30880-c8c8c3bd-26e0-4129-ac5a-689ce3c5bf83-1566236769"}

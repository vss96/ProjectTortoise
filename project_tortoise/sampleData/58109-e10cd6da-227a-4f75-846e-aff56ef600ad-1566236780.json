We helped Sadaam into power after our eff up in IRAN after we put in the SHah to preserve British Petroleum from becoming state run for the current IRANian president. Its been about Southeast Asia and the Middle East for some time.  Every war was a long slaught out attempt to get there for economy control and resources.  IRAN was actually a democracy before we tore it up for Britain in the 50's.  We installed Islamic rule there.  Then they went nuts and Sadaam was in there controlling it.  He overstepped his bounds and we booted him like IRAN 55+ years ago.  Same story, Britain and others get the US to invade only this time they screwed us on the currency situation by helping IRAN.  I have said too much.","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1167449940,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cwfc5","parent_id":"t1_cwfa7","author":"drawkbox","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473809658,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58109-e10cd6da-227a-4f75-846e-aff56ef600ad-1566236780"}

{"link_id":"t3_ug5r","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"Hardly. If an advertising service isn't surviving, they need to look to their own business practices and not blame their competitors for being \"too successful\". Craigslist is providing a service we used to have for free when we used to be able to post signs on bulletin boards and corner telephone poles - it's just a cleaner, neater, more effective system. \r\n\r\nFor all the boo-hooing by the newspapers, the media corporations have been running 20% profit margins - they are doing very well, but they are the ones who are too greedy. They are the ones who are taking successful, profitable companies and cannibalizing them for short-term profits - laying off staff, reducing in-depth reporting and hard news , replacing it with fluff, outsourcing their printing so they can stop paying union wages. They are the ones making their papers hardly worth reading any more. \r\n\r\nIn the end, it will be their own actions that destroy the newpapers. Craigslist is not competing with the newspapers any more than thousands of other services are doing. And I can't believe any classified ad profit lost to Craigslist  can compare near what the print ads or the advertising inserts bring. They can raise their prices on those ads instead.\r\n\r\n And why is it that we should be concerned about the corporate newspapers anyway - why should Craigslist be made guilty of not handicapping themselves so that wealthier people can stay wealthier?","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165955320,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cum6j","parent_id":"t1_cuh0f","author":"CAcyclist","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808421,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25552-9b39f2f0-de1e-4719-a50d-9601f577fee1-1566236767"}

We're at the point where no-one else is reading this and our post lengths are now officially ridiculous.\r\n\r\n&gt;The \"non-overlapping magisteria fallacy\" is not a fallacy, [...]there may be some kind of overlap between domains in some respects.\r\n\r\nYou do seem to be unintentionally satirising yourself here.\r\n\r\nBut in any case, you can't simply declare an entire area of investigation off-limits to science, even if *some claims* in that area can't be proven experimentally. Any area of investigation, scientific or not, may become relevant to any other.\r\n\r\nFicino made specific claims about the nature of the spirit: that it's a connective fluid or vapour between soul and body, that depression is caused when the spirit consumes itself with too much intense thought, that wine might restore it. His assertions were metaphysical in nature. Do you think that neuroscience, psychology and biochemistry have nothing useful to say about these assertions?\r\n\r\n&gt;materialism is not adequate to explain the whole of human experience.\r\n\r\nBut nothing you've described *explains* the whole of human experience either. It just describes it with a different set of labels.\r\n\r\n&gt;When I described my experiences I said outright that I did not expect them to convince you of anything, I don't care what you think.\r\n\r\nBut you go on to lay out other evidence at some length. Either your position is that the evidence can be persuasive, or your position is that at some point the evidence is insufficient and a leap of faith is required.\r\n\r\nIf the former, then I'm entitled to point out that the simplest explanation above is that one or more of the monks briefed the boy. If I take the supernatural explanation at face value, then how do I pick it in favour to conflicting accounts that provide a supernatural explanation? Such as the ones that tell me that an Angel of the Lord revealed that the Lamas, as worshippers of idols, are going to Hell?\r\n\r\nIf your position is that a leap of faith is required, then - fair enough. I don't feel the need to correct irrationality surgically. I'm irrational on a daily basis about all kinds of things. So is everyone else I know. Your beliefs are much less dangerous than (for example) a naive faith in free markets. However, you can't then reasonably expect those beliefs to influence arguments about the way other people should live their lives, or public policy should work. Which takes me back to my very beginning point: that we need a working approximation of truth, so that we can decide what it's most sensible to do to make the world a better place.","created_utc":1166818158,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46057-56ca388c-6014-42a2-91ee-5c3f0cab6fe3-1566236775"}

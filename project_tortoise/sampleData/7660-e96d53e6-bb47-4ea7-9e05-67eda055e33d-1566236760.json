I am not joining the overall argument either way, but I will respond with \"not exactly\" to the idea that \"money is not neutral BECAUSE price increases are not uniform across all prices\":\r\n\r\nLabor costs do not easily adjust downward, particularly with the existence of contracts (with individuals or organized labor). So when labor becomes 'less valuable' in one sector, or profits to that sector decreases or do not grow fast enough, businesses are technically paying more for labor than the market demands.\r\n\r\nBut it is easier to not give someone a raise than to cut wages. This is where inflation is seen as a benefit to some. It allows relative prices to adjust to market conditions more easily. Wages in some sectors hold, and then others where the market dictates see an increase to compensate for inflation (or expected inflation).\r\n\r\nShort explanation, hopefully it makes sense.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tkec","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807746,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"reddit_doe","id":"ctm6g","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctlln","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7660-e96d53e6-bb47-4ea7-9e05-67eda055e33d-1566236760"}

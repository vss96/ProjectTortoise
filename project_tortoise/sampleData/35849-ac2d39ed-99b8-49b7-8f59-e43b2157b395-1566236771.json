For the third and fourth betting rounds, the \"turn\" and the \"river,\" his pokerbots update the probability of each possible hand by taking into account betting as well as the revealed cards. The strategy for those rounds is then computed in real-time for the setting at hand.\r\n\r\n&gt; To reduce the computational complexity, GS1 and GS2 automatically recognize strategically equivalent hands. For instance, 25,989,600 distinct hands are possible in the second round, but only about a million are strategically different. That's still too many to compute, so the pokerbots group strategically similar hands together. The end result is 2,465 groups, a small enough number to allow computational analysis.\r\n\r\n&gt; In addition to participating in the Computer Poker Competition, Sandholm and Gilpin will present a paper on the GS1 pokerbot during the AI meeting in Boston.\r\n\r\n&gt; For more on the AAAI Computer Poker Competition, visit www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06poker.php.","controversiality":0,"score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1166454186,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35849-ac2d39ed-99b8-49b7-8f59-e43b2157b395-1566236771"}

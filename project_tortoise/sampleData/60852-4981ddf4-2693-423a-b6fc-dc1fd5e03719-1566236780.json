{"body":"What you are probably referring to is the infamous case in which a Barbie doll was carbon dated. The answer came back that it was over 60,000 years old, that is older than is measurable using that technique.\r\n\r\nThe doll was made in the twentieth century, out of plastic, which was made from oil - and most oil was laid down 60 to 180 million years ago. Therefore a test with a maximum range of 60,000 years could not measure the age of the oil from which the plastic was made with any accuracy.\r\n\r\nTop tip: anyone who tells you that carbon dating can give ages in millions of years has no idea what they are talking about","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wiw8","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167602721,"score":10,"ups":10,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"apodo","edited":false,"id":"cwkuk","parent_id":"t1_cwk7f","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809759,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60852-4981ddf4-2693-423a-b6fc-dc1fd5e03719-1566236780"}

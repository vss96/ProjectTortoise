They don't benefit at all from their action...\r\n\r\nIn place of \"empathy\" I'd have \"valuing being moral\". That is, having a concern to act for the benefit of others is a foundational value one buys into or rejects.\r\n\r\nFurther we must distinguish being moral, acting for the interests of others, from being prudent, acting for one's interests. With this distinguished we can see that sometimes doing the morally correct thing might require doing the imprudent thing. Playing with your (yters) example: the pilot in the stricken plane chooses not to eject but steer it away from the crowd. Here the pilot has chosen the moral course over the self-interested one. An altruistic act.\r\n\r\nIf you believe in an afterlife with just reward then acting altruistically is more difficult. You'd have to be willing to disobey god, be sent to hell forever, to do the morally correct thing. (Say if god commanded you to do something immoral like stone someone who \"blasphemeth the name of the LORD\" Lev 24:16).\r\n\r\nHowever, this atheist \"basis\" for morality, to value being moral in the first place, is no lynch pin. That is, you can be largely a cunt throughout your life and make no rational mistake nor attract cosmic deserts. In this way morality is without ground.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tq6l","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165379179,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10729-356cd296-456b-4d6c-b8ee-bb0c966d02c3-1566236761"}

I know because for a time, I was brainwashed.  I could not think, I could not discern, and I certainly could not be trusted to make good decisions.  if this is what you want for the teenage parents in the way of 'help,' go ahead and advocate abstinence.  \r\n\r\nthe opposite tack would be to fully introduce modern methods of birth control that would extend independent youth.  certainly, commitment would benefit the teens from your old neighborhood, but advocating a scheme that goes against human nature seems like a last-ditch effort to knock that which has seemed intractable for long enough to make theology attractive.  it isn't likely to work, it presumes and usually includes religious principles that youths are not always amenable to, and it does have roots in theology rather than science.\r\n\r\nagain, you appear more frustrated through your insulting rhetoric than informed or rational, which is out of place on this site.  please just think and communicate &amp; stop trying to insult the very people you're trying to reach.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166281493,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32414-24e4827d-eb80-43d5-a0dd-6760b8a32a67-1566236770"}

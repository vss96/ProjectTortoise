Why stop there?\r\n\r\nI think that O/R mappers or providing SQL queries in a OOP language is the wrong way. Providing relations as first class datatypes instead and connecting them transparently to the database is the way to go. And by the way it's possible to get rid of OOP altogether.\r\n","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167446635,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t1_cweuq","edited":false,"id":"cwf6v","author_flair_text":null,"author":"kawa","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809655,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58034-5fb5472d-5bd8-4018-bae6-01e2ab132631-1566236780"}

The only dice which can be roses are the ones in which there is a center spot with a symmetrical arrangement around them (which are the three and five). You assume the center spot is the rose, then add up the petals (two for each three roll or four for each five roll) and that's the answer.\r\n\r\nSo if you get 3, 3, 1, 2, 6 the only roses are the first two, each of which have two petals, so the answer is four.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the \"hint\" of the name is that roses are MADE of petals. It is therefore rather deceptive to talk about petals being AROUND a rose.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807582,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctde9","id":"ctdhp","edited":false,"author":"sixstrings","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3774-a9006b6c-2516-4057-b30e-e94d12dcb898-1566236759"}

What point are you trying to make?\r\n\r\n&gt;And to boast of portability to all these alternative, not-so-compatible-with-each-other CL implementations, ...\r\n\r\nNow you're just arse-talking. CL-PPCRE is 100% ANSI Common Lisp. Therefore, it is 100% portable to any CL implementation that conforms to ANSI. \r\n\r\n&gt;Perl, at least, has one implementation and portability is built at the underlying level of the interpreter.\r\n\r\nReally? I wrote an application in perl5.004 that does NOT work in 5.8. Perl 4? Perl 6? These are all incompatible versions of Perl that differ from eachother a lot more than, say, CMUCL and CLISP.\r\n\r\nWhere's my clue stick? ... I think i'll need the big one for this .... WHACK.

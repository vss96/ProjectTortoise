Calm down there slugger. You remind me of a horrible, horrible person my brother once dated (PANCAKES?!?!? hehehe... never mind, inside joke).\r\n\r\nHave you ever tried porting a PHP script to Perl?\r\n\r\nWho cares if \"Personal Home Pages\" was the original name (Oh, and btw. Nice of you to point out the bleedin' obvious since he says this in the article.)? What does \"Personal Home Pages\" have to do with open-source naming conventions? That was a really pointless point.\r\n\r\nTell me more about Perls \"glaring flaws\". \r\n\r\nWhen PHP was beginning to grow in popularity, there was a lot of discussion along the lines of Perl being old-fashioned and PHP being its successor. Which was mostly based on a misunderstanding of Perl. Ask any young PHP coder today what Perl is and they'll most likely tell you it's an old language that used to be used for cgi web scripting. They don't even know that it has lots of other applications and competes more with things like Python and Ruby than PHP. I (mostly) abandoned PHP for Perl a couple of years ago. I didn't come at it the other way around. I found that Perl allowed me to do a lot more and allowed for a lot more flexibility in how to do things. So I was able to dive right in with my knowledge of PHP and gradually move towards some of the powerful, Perl-specific things.\r\n\r\nMaybe you see glaring flaws where I see power and flexibility. And don't forget, Perl has excellent whipuptitude!","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809017,"gilded":0,"id":"cvhoe","parent_id":"t1_cvgp6","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40792-7f4aec88-250a-47c7-b22b-0391ef6a4d38-1566236773"}

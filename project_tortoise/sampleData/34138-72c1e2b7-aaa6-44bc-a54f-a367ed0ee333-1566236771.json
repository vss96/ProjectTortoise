There's nothing wrong with noting that.\r\n\r\nThat's a straw man argument.  I already said \"no one disputes that genes affect appearance\".  You saying Samoans are big is like saying that South Africans have dark skin (you'd still be wrong about lots of people, of course, but you get my point: it's a stupidly obvious thing to say).\r\n\r\nNor have I disputed that genes affect behaviour.  Where we differ is that you apply the behavioural effects of genes to entire \"human populations\", which, as the dictionary points out, means races.\r\n\r\n\"I have brown hair because my parents both have brown hair\": genetics.\r\n\r\n\"African men are 'playas' because black people are unusually sexually promiscuous and/or aggressive\": racism.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34138-72c1e2b7-aaa6-44bc-a54f-a367ed0ee333-1566236771"}

In the past few decades, as it has become increasingly acceptable to be homosexual, especially a homosexual male (media loves lipstick lesbians), women have been increasingly attracted to them in a completely different way unlike any, I believe, society has ever seen. The \"Will and Grace\" mentality in which it is acceptable to live with a man, spend the night with a man, bathe with a man, particularly out of wedlock, has become acceptable if the man is homosexual. Why? Is it fun? Is it, in fact, sexy or at least exciting? Is it that it's so taboo? If I acted more gay (metro-sexual?), made my sexuality a little more ambiguous, would women be more willing to bathe with me? A very peculiar phenomenon, indeed.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_utvb","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1166191444,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30385-d96e9462-d58e-48bd-bf2c-a0252f19ac93-1566236769"}

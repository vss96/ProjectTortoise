{"controversiality":1,"body":"&gt;Here's an article from the New York Times smearing Duke along the lines he claimed\r\n\r\nThe article says, as you quoted it, \"David Duke, whose prepared remarks, issued by the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said the gas chambers in which millions perished actually did not exist\".\r\n\r\nThat's only a smear if in fact his \"prepared remarks\" did not say that.  Where's the copy of his prepared remarks?\r\n\r\n&gt;Furthermore, it was picked up and reported by other newspapers all over the world, like this one\r\n\r\nGive me a break - the Canada Free Press is not even a newspaper, its a website.  And they claim they're quoting CBS News: prove it.\r\n\r\nDuke is claiming there's an international Zionist smear campaign against him, but he's much too self-important: no one really cares about Duke enough to form an international conspiracy against him.\r\n\r\n&gt;It is important that people be able to discuss history without fear of being put in jail or otherwise punsihed.\r\n\r\nOkay, fine.  Let's stop talking about Duke then, and cut to the chase.  You appear to agree with Duke on a number of issues.  Do you believe that the Holocaust occurred?\r\n\r\nAs abrown said, lay your cards on the table.","link_id":"t3_v38q","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166372170,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"author":"adrian","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv47x","parent_id":"t1_cv45m","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808759,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33952-fd39993c-c0e3-4566-b028-37a3472bc361-1566236771"}

One of the most compelling reasons more people don't do it is because they care about how much it would hurt those who love them.\r\n\r\nAs for letting people off the hook for actions caused by illness, I'd blame a kid who mugged me, even if he needed it to support a drug habit exacerbated by mental illness. I'd blame someone who molested my children, even though pedophilia is a mental illness. I'd blame an alcoholic who drove drunk and killed my wife. And for the same reasons, i have no sympathy for those who take the cowardly way out of life.","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2171-fb4135a0-7dc8-4171-bef2-25e568db86a2-1566236758"}

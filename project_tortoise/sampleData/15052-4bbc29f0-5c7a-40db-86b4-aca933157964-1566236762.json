If no one has the guts to make a grab for it, we can’t tell.\r\n\r\nImagine you gave your new auction site a feature which made it considerably better than eBay for some group of 100k people. It makes it extra easy to sell intangibles, say, or it’s kid-friendly, or it adds another layer of fraud protection. Maybe just that it’s really fast. If you can get 50k of those people and grow at 20% per month, in two years you’ll have 4m users.\r\n\r\nThose are optimistic numbers, but I don’t think they’re absurd. Craigslist came out of nowhere. Powells.com is surviving alongside Amazon. Google came right up under … uh … whatever the search engines were before Google. You *can* compete against dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nEdit: [marvin already said this (below).](http://programming.reddit.com/info/u09a/comments/cu1js)","link_id":"t3_u09a","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808045,"distinguished":null,"author":"celoyd","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cu1uw","id":"cu276","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15052-4bbc29f0-5c7a-40db-86b4-aca933157964-1566236762"}

Either the newly 'privatized' organizations are saddled with so much regulation and/or restrictions that they cannot continue without the assistance of government, or they are 'privatized' into the hands of those with good government connections that usually destroy the company by looting it blind.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, private companies and government bureaucracies are run entirely differently with entirely different results. Bureaucracies exist to perpetuate themselves, always consuming more year after year. In a bureaucracy, efficiency isn't rewarded, it is punished: for an efficient bureacracy is one that cannot ask for more money the next year.\r\n\r\nTherefore, government bureaucracies usually have way too many people doing way to little, inefficient infrastructure, wasted capital, and other serious problems that must be dealt with when privatized. These issues also add to the difficulties facing any privatization effort.\r\n\r\nWith the deck stacked so much against privitization of government services, it is no wonder the failure rate is so high.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w2wl","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52162-2100e7dc-7525-43c5-8b32-c5c2b376563a-1566236778"}

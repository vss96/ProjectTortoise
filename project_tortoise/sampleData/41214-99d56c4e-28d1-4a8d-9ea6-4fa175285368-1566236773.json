{"body":"I still prefer Netflix.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen any delaying of DVDs from them, but that is probably because I am not eagerly trying to rent the latest movie as soon as it comes out.\r\n\r\nBlockbuster has done too much in the past to damage my opinion of them. Whether it was the late fee issue or them editing their movies to make them more \"family friendly\",  I don't see myself going back to Blockbuster anytime soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are other options besides Netflix or Blockbuster as well.  I hear good things about GreenCine and I might try them out if Netflix ever gives me a good reason to look elsewhere.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vidh","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166635312,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t3_vidh","id":"cvigh","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809032,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41214-99d56c4e-28d1-4a8d-9ea6-4fa175285368-1566236773"}

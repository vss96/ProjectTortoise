It *feels* like a slippery-slope kind of situation. And I always find myself -- even though I'm not a law-breaker -- imagining this from the perspective of the targets of the raids, not the police themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my reasonable side did notice the fact that the numbers (an average of 2 deaths vs. 50,000 raids per year) kind of undermine the writer's argument.\r\n\r\nBut then I recall: \"over the last 25 years, we've seen a staggering 1,300 percent increase in paramilitary style forced-entry raids in the United States...\"\r\n\r\nAnd then I think: *slippery-slope! What if that was me!*\r\n\r\nAnd the general result is that I operate with a moderate distrust and skepticism of the police at all times, which I kind of want to think of as a rational stance to take in a purportedly-free republic.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12895-19efd697-7e01-4868-89c1-44b38e67646b-1566236762"}

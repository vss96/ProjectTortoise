They charge for their Google devices that are self contained search servers.  They should offer that for a monthly fee, most larger clients would pay for any free usage.  I agree its hard to give bandwidth and diskspace for free but they could get plenty of people signing up to this.  As a GOOG holder I find it odd they would discontinue this.  So SOAP sucks, add other implementations but dont' limit your services.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809174,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_vlt4","id":"cvpsm","edited":false,"author":"drawkbox","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44909-74ba9a38-99b3-48b3-8009-23dccfe04a59-1566236774"}

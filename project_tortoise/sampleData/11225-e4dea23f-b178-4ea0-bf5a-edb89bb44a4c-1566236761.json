I'll tell you how do I work (a bit of anedoctal stuff, but I think I'm not that alone): \r\n\r\nI have some deadlines and a lot of stuff to do. I have a very rigid schedule, which I subscribe wholeheartly (and don't miss it by a single day!). The problem is, not everyday is a productive day; on a really productive day, I can make the work of ten or more people. On non-productive days, the rates would be negative, if possible. I'm kinda in a (very) small \"open cube\" (and kinda noisy) setup.\r\n\r\nI worked at home (for some other reasons) for some time. Months ago. At home, I woke up at 10 am, and started to work; nonstop until 18 pm. Somedays I woke up earlier; somedays hours later. But my productivity was still very good.\r\n\r\nWell, it only confirmed to me that 1) not every person have the same way to be productive, 2) not every person wants to get up early and 3) Silence is golden.\r\n\r\nI didn't feel like slacking when I had flexible hours.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11225-e4dea23f-b178-4ea0-bf5a-edb89bb44a4c-1566236761"}

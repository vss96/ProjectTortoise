{"controversiality":0,"body":"My first iPod (the original 20GB one) died 13 months after I bought it. No mishandling on my side: the harddrive just gave up on me.\r\n\r\nA year later I bought an iPod Mini. It stopped working after 2 months. I got a replacement from Apple, but that didn't even start up. Back to Apple, another replacement. My second replacement has been working for 12 months without problems so far.\r\n\r\nI love the user-friendlieness of iPods, but the hardware is pure crap.","link_id":"t3_uawn","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165743370,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"fvincentis","edited":false,"id":"cub9m","parent_id":"t3_uawn","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808215,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19916-326efe51-6e33-4068-af25-83c8447186ce-1566236764"}

These design and quality issues are across the GM product line.  I have rented Escalades, Grand Prix, Grand Ams, full size vans (which were actually okay - but I have no imports to compare them to), Cavaliers, Cobalts, even a Corvette once out in Arizona and I'm sure some I'm forgetting.  \r\n\r\nPrice is nothing if you don't have good quality and design.  GM must wake up and see the Euro (to a lesser extent), Japanese and Korean competitors are going to chip away at them.  The older \"American or nothing\" USA car buyers are dying off.  Two things I see as eventual nails in the coffin of GM and Ford, unless they change:\r\n\r\n(1) Chinese autos will start coming in to USA in next 5 years and totally undercut low price points for US autos\r\n\r\n(2) Increase in Japanese and Korean (and other) SUVs in the US.  This will undercut US Auto cash cows.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167536194,"score":33,"ups":33,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59593-703cad8e-4364-4820-a1ec-d5e7a24ba71d-1566236780"}

It also presumes that there are only two solutions to the problem at hand: stay and submit, or tuck tail and leave. Well, I'll stay and fight for what is right, thank you.\r\n\r\nI also love the implicit agreement argument, aka 'the social contract'. So every little thing that the government comes up with to turn us into little slaves is suddenly 'social contract'. How about the drug war? Is that an implicit agreement? Spending half of the money they take on crazy foreign wars? How about that?\r\n\r\nIf taxes are an 'implicit agreement', then why does it take thousands of incomprehensible law to describe them?\r\n\r\n'Social contract' is a complex interaction between culture and evolutionary behavior, not arbitrary rules imposed by thugs. Government takes advantage of our built-in wish to cooperate with those we live around, piggybacking upon it, and insisting that it is the reason we don't immediately drop everything to rape, pillage, pillage and murder our fellow man.\r\n\r\nIt's just a big scam which you've swallowed hook, line, and sinker.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27899-73003eaf-5d90-4ed5-bdc3-ef4e089ecb52-1566236768"}

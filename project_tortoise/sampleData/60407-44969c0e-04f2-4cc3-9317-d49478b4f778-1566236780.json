{"body":"Can you answer this:\r\n\r\n&gt; 'You're going to hell and you're going to burn in a lake of fire'\r\n\r\nWith: \"And if you don't love me as a neighbor, so will you\"?\r\n\r\nSeriously, how can people be Christians and have so much hate? Christ was dying on the cross and LOVED the people who murdered Him.\r\n\r\n&gt; \"People think unless you've found Jesus, you can't love your neighbor in any significant sense,\" he said.\r\n\r\nReally? From what I read, people find Jesus and then hate their neighbor every way they can.\r\n\r\n...This isn't a war; other people are all we have.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wj0p","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":13,"ups":13,"created_utc":1167588166,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cwk4w","parent_id":"t3_wj0p","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809746,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60407-44969c0e-04f2-4cc3-9317-d49478b4f778-1566236780"}

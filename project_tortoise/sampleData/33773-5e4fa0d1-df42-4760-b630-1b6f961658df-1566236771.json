Explicit self declaration is not among my favorite Python features either, but still I don't see any practical value in this. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, having to annotate each method with @selfless is much worse than including self as the first parameter. It's also bad for code readability to break common conventions like this. Once you get used to having self as a parameter in each method declaration, \"selfless\" methods start jumping out of the code screaming potential bug.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166359993,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33773-5e4fa0d1-df42-4760-b630-1b6f961658df-1566236771"}

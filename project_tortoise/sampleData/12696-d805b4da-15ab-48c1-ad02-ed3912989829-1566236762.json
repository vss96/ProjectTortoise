I'm counting the rest as the difference between a 2bdrm and a 3bdrm apartment in my area.  I pay all the insurance and the kids go to public school.\r\n\r\nThe extra money doesn't go to the kids.  I mean, what the fuck more do they need anyway?  More toys?  Fuck that.  I'd PREFER that they don't become materialistic drones like their Mother.  \r\n\r\nThe extra money I pay goes to pay for the Mother's fancy new car.  That's the problem with child support being tied to the father's income.  For all intents and purposes it costs about the same amount of money to raise a kid no matter how much you make.  Kids don't NEED an XBOX 360.  They don't NEED a fucking mini-ATV.  They need food, family, medical attention, and a roof over their heads.  That doesn't change if I make $30,000 a year or $100,000.\r\n\r\nThe remainder goes to the Mother.\r\n\r\nI say Mothers should have some accountability when it comes to child support.  Keep receipts for a year, take them to a Judge, the Judge scratches all the unneccsary shit off the list, and each parent pays half of what it actually cost to support the kid.\r\n\r\nOh, and how about you count the money it costs for me to support the kids on weekends too?

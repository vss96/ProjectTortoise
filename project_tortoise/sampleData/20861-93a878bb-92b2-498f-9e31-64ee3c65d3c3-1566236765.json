They established a military government which killed at least 2000 people over the next 17 years. Pinochet claimed to be an anticommunist crusader but his actions were not easily distinguishable from those of an ordinary brutal authoritarian.\r\n\r\nNixon and Kissinger helped Pinochet though several difficulties because he was nominally anticommunist. In retrospect, many people feel this was a bad idea.\r\n\r\nThe comparisons with Thatcher are because they both came to power in the 70s, moved their country to the economic right, and left power in 1990. Clearly Thatcher was not having thousands of people killed, but arguably she shared some economic ideals with Pinochet, and there were plenty of people who feared that her government would slide toward some kind of fascism.\r\n\r\nIf you want more backgound, Iâ€™d start with Wikipedia.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20861-93a878bb-92b2-498f-9e31-64ee3c65d3c3-1566236765"}

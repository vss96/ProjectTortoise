He sees a file read without error handling and assumes that\r\nerror handling cannot be added.  Meanwhile, empty error handlers\r\nmake perfect sense to him, even in an uncompilable fragment meant\r\nto demonstrate a file-reading method.  He's calling Python a toy,\r\nbut his reasoning applies to damn near any language except Java.\r\n\r\nThat's the mindset of Java.  Most people who hate Java are not\r\npassionate partisans of another language.  They are Java programmers or\r\nex-Java programmers who got sick of being pushed around by a language.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_utqb","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166246731,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32056-0e2b164a-9db2-47c6-8bd3-2964758a6d37-1566236770"}

I find it odd that all these people decided to leave feedback over a three day period.  Not to say it is not possible, but if you look at the dates and times, all the negative feedback came between dec. 5-8.  And many of these negative messages are only minutes apart. If you read the comments, some of the people say they got ripped off weeks prior, some more recently.  \r\n\r\nIf these are feedback scores from different people who got ripped off or realized they gto ripped off at different times, then why do they ALL leave feedback at relatively the same time.  Heck, even if they all got ripped off on the same day, what are the odds that all of them would leave feedback within such a short time of one another.  Dec. 8 alone only has 20 entries.\r\n\r\nSeems a little fishy to me.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808248,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cud01","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uay2","author_flair_text":null,"author":"BLACKINFIDEL","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20829-9810a329-a92e-425f-a910-e9a6504b6884-1566236765"}

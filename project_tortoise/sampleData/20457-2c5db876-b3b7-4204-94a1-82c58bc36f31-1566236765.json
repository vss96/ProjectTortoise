There are lots of times you want typographic variation when you're not emphasizing text, e.g. book titles, mathematical variables, etc. And if there isn't a proper \"semantic\" tag in HTML for what you're trying to do, your only options are &lt;span class=\"foo\"&gt; and &lt;b&gt; or &lt;i&gt; (with a class if you really want). &lt;span&gt; and &lt;i&gt; are equally semantically empty, so there's no reason to choose &lt;span&gt; over &lt;i&gt;. And &lt;i&gt; is shorter and gives the desired effect without CSS, for e.g. Lynx and cellphone users.","link_id":"t3_u9w3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165775573,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cucdt","parent_id":"t1_cuccd","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808236,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20457-2c5db876-b3b7-4204-94a1-82c58bc36f31-1566236765"}

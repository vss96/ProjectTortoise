Their attitude towards contraceptives is like saying \"Never drive recklessly. Also, don't wear seatbelts or use airbags or childseats. In fact, strap your child to the front of your car. Be safe!\"\r\n\r\nI'm not a Catholic, and *I* am against sex outside of committed relationships. But I also think it's really, really stupid to turn your back on modern morality and modern medicine by pretending that people should suffer as much as possible for their bad decisions.\r\n\r\n&gt;Contraceptives in general don't prevent the spread of disease anyway. Condoms don't even fully prevent AIDS\r\n\r\nContraceptives certainly don't *hurt*. Depends on which you use -- I'm aware that the actual AIDS virus is able to fit through an invisible tear in a condom, but I'm also aware that wearing a condom drastically reduces your chances of spreading or catching a disease. Nobody (except the Catholic church, apparently) entertains the notion that any form of birth control is 100% effective at preventing disease or pregnancy. But being unable to completely solve the problem doesn't absolve of us of the responsibility to do our best.\r\n\r\nUnless we're Catholic, of course.

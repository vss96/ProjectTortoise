The thing that upsets people who watch things like this is that you can make a kid's mind up pretty easily.  Making a kid's mind up about an issue as complex as abortion when they don't have the intellectual capacity to understand what you're even talking about is wrong.  If you get them when they're young enough, you can turn a kid into just about anything, a nazi, a racist, an abortion hater, whatever you want.  Resisting the temptation to make a person's mind up just because he's a little kid is the righteous path, not manipulating him into agreeing with your zealotry.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808204,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuako","edited":false,"id":"cuana","author_flair_text":null,"author":"talkincat","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19615-46817d5f-61de-435e-8be9-574b20042106-1566236764"}

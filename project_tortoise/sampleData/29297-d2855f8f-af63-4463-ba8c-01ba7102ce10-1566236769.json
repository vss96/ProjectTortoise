All education should be like the education I got there.  The teachers taught by *involving* the students.  Science and art were sort of combined - we'd make drawings, paintings, models of the things we were studying in science.  In history we'd play role-playing games about WWII, or the Oregon Trail... we took trips - week long trips - one to Drumheller, in Canada - the year we studied dinosaurs.  One trip followed the path of the Oregon Trail.  And the best part?  We were *all* geeks.  Or almost all of us, anyways.  Enough of us so that the kids who would have been considered \"cool\" and left the rest of us out, couldn't.  They never wanted to, I'm sure.  Admittedly, there were a couple outcasts - it wasn't all hunky-dory - kids are mean and when someone is very distinctly different from the rest, they will either avoid that person or gang up on them.  Having a tiny tiny class size probably helped avoid most of that - my 7th &amp; 8th grade class *combined* was 21 people.\r\n\r\nTHAT is a good education.\r\n\r\nThen I went to high school.  I'm still recovering.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166140683,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":17,"ups":17,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuu4q","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuu2k","author":"molasses","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808568,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29297-d2855f8f-af63-4463-ba8c-01ba7102ce10-1566236769"}

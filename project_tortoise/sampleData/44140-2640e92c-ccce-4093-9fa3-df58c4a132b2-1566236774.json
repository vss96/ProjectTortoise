{"controversiality":0,"body":"\"Ohhh, some people don't like you to talk like that. Ohh, some people like to shut you up for saying those things. \r\nYou know that. Lots of people. Lots of groups in this country want to tell you how to talk. \r\nTell you what you can't talk about. Well, sometimes they'll say, well you can talk about something but you can't joke about it. \r\nSay you can't joke about something because it's not funny. Comedians run into that shit all the time.\r\n Like rape. They'll say, \"you can't joke about rape. Rape's not funny.\" \r\nI say, \"fuck you, I think it's hilarious. How do you like that?\" \r\nI can prove to you that rape is funny. Picture Porky Pig raping Elmer Fudd. \r\nSee, hey why do you think they call him \"Porky,\" eh? I know what you're going to say. \r\n\"Elmer was asking for it. Elmer was coming on to Porky. \r\nPorky couldn't help himself, he got a hard- on, he got horney, he lost control, he went out of his mind.\" \r\nA lot of men talk like that. A lot of men think that way. They think it's the woman's fault. \r\nThey like to blame the rape on the woman. Say, \"she had it coming, she was wearing a short skirt.\" \r\nThese guys think women ought to go to prison for being cock teasers. Don't seem fair to me. \r\nDon't seem right, but you can joke about it. I believe you can joke about anything. \r\nIt all depends on how you construct the joke. What the exaggeration is. What the exaggeration is. \r\nBecause every joke needs one exaggeration. Every joke needs one thing to be way out of proportion. \r\nGive you an example. Did you ever see a news story like this in the paper? \r\nEvery now and then you run into a story, says, \"some guy broke into a house, stole a lot of things, and while he was in there, he raped an 81 year old woman.\" \r\nAnd I'm thinking to myself, \"WHY??? What the fuck kind of a social life does this guy have?\" \r\nI want to say, \"why did you do that?\" \"Well she was coming on to me. We were dancing and I got horney. \r\nHey, she was asking for it, she had on a tight bathrobe.\" I'll say, \"Jesus Christ, be a little fucking selective next time will you?\" \"\r\n-George Carlin","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vmh8","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166733288,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"foxyvixen","edited":false,"id":"cvoce","parent_id":"t3_vmh8","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809146,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44140-2640e92c-ccce-4093-9fa3-df58c4a132b2-1566236774"}

I don't deny the atrocities or anything, but what is the reason it has to be taught over and over again? Yeah, so that it can't happen again!\r\nWhat a noble cause. There were state backed mass murders at the same time in other places and there are state backed mass murders now. There has never been a war just to stop such killings.\r\nYou should learn about the holocaust but you should realize that this is no one time only event. Just as people might have never heard about it, most people in Europe or America never heard of large scale atrocities comitted in Africa for example. Or they forget about it when it's no longer in the news.","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33689-4d2fbbba-f581-4932-bb2f-e7f190c09af2-1566236771"}

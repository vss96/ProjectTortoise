For instance, one application had many tightly coupled pieces and ended up being rewritten as a platform with many loosely coupled plugins and services.  In another case, a set of actions to be performed was originally assumed to always be the same in many places throughout the code.  In the rewrite, it was broken up into a workflow model, where individual actions didn't know about one another and it was up to the operator to piece them together.\r\n\r\nIncremental changes also make it harder to deal with the big picture of design, since it can be very difficult to mutate from one design to another.\r\n\r\nImagine a 30,000 line PHP application that has HTML inline with the code and other such bad practices, is brittle, and is inherently insecure due to poor programming, and imagine the steps required to mutate that into a solid, secure MVC pattern, versus just rewriting the whole thing the correct way in e.g. Python.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809564,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cwa2n","id":"cwacl","edited":false,"author":"inkieminstrel","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55500-7344b2e8-4d02-438d-a596-e05d1fff92ce-1566236779"}

If someone writes a loop long enough to be off the screen, in vi I can match curly braces (or parentheses) by pressing %. In Python, such a task is a mite less intuitive - thought I'll admit, that may be a relatively simple editor function to implement.\r\n\r\nWhat? How does whitespace not delineate blocks nearly as clearly? You're telling me that you can spot two 12 pixel tall squiggles at the top and bottom of your screen, at the same time, better than you can tell if a block is closer or farther from the edge of the screen?\r\n\r\nAlso I don't understand the part about a code block long enough to go off the screen. Surely it is *easier* in Python since you don't need to see the top and bottom of the block to determine the level of indentation?\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165901575,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24156-6d37df60-f310-40a5-b133-cb88af0c91a8-1566236767"}

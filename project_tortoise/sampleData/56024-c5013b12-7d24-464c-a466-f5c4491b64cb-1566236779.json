Upgrading is not worth spending any time or money or any type of resources on right now, and I really doubt that this will change. What you get is XP + eye candy + [a purposefully-annoying MS-covering-its-ass security scheme](http://clevershark.com/?p=1455) basically designed so Microsoft can say \"we tried\" when the user finally turns off the protections and gets infected with viruses or spyware. And frankly just the fact that Microsoft feels it has to give away $2000 laptops for users to check it out -- I haven't paid $1000 for a laptop since that time I bought a Powerbook in 1999 -- should tell you plenty about what a resource hog Vista really is.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809582,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cwbav","parent_id":"t3_wa4q","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56024-c5013b12-7d24-464c-a466-f5c4491b64cb-1566236779"}

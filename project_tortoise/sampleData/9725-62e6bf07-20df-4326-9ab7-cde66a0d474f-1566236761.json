It's called division of labour.  That's one of the main good things about setting a price on polution: other people can use this number as a proxy when making decisions rather than having to derive everything from scratch over and over again.\r\n\r\nWould I be better off, when buying a car, having the salesman tell me \"well, the cost for this car is 500kg steel, 15 barrels of oil, 5 man hours, 0.000006% of a factory,0.00003 hours of our designers, ...\"  No, he tells me a price which takes all of this into account, so I can easily compare costs with the next car.  Except, it doesn't take into account *all* the costs, because pollution isn't accounted for...hence the Â£70 per ton of carbon etc.\r\n\r\nIf Monbiot could understand simple but fundamental points like this, I'd take him more seriously.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807831,"gilded":0,"id":"ctqnw","parent_id":"t3_tocm","edited":false,"author":"acrophobia","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9725-62e6bf07-20df-4326-9ab7-cde66a0d474f-1566236761"}

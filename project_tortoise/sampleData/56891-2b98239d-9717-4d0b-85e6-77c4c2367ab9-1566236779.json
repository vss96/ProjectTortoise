{"body":"Brilliant. As a lot of people mentioned, it only works with very skilled lecturers, of course.\r\n\r\nI had one in my high school biology class. Everyone, at the time, *hated* him with a passion : he'd begin the lesson by speaking in a monotone for 45 minutes, so your first challenge was to actually stay awake. Also, he'd give the exact, same lecture more than once - twice for simple topics, thrice for more complicated ones - so not surrendering to boredom was your next challenge. At the end of the class he'd pass sheets with lots of questions, and he would've answered each and every one of them in the course of his lecture, so if you missed a few he'd answer them in the next class.\r\n\r\nHe never gave any \"straight\" answer : if anyone asked for a particular question's answer, he'd either answer that he already answered that question during his lecture or get back to the precise part of his lecture in which the answer was \"hidden\". Grades were either very high or very low in this class, because students used to cramming up for exams could never took the time to actually understand what he was saying.\r\n\r\nWe learned a lot from that guy because his boring teaching style forced us to actually listen analyze information in real-time. I know it may sound strange but right now, most of his former students I've met realize we learned a lot from him.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wbx5","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167408875,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":11,"ups":11,"author":"SolarBear","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_wbx5","edited":false,"id":"cwd6d","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809616,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56891-2b98239d-9717-4d0b-85e6-77c4c2367ab9-1566236779"}

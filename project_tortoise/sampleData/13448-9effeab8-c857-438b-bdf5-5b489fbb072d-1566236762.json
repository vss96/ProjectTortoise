The \"mechanize\" packages, on perl and python\r\n2. The packages that script IE directly. I forget the exact names.\r\n\r\n1) is far more scalable and works everwhere that I've seen, 2) is wire-identical to a real, in-use browser, because it is one -&gt; it is more difficult to detect and is used in those annoying commercial myspace auto-adders, for example.\r\n\r\nedit: Ah well, no one's awake at this hour anyway.\r\n\r\nThe other half of web programming:\r\n\r\n          #!/usr/bin/env python2.4\r\n          import mechanize\r\n\r\n          b = mechanize.Browser(factory=mechanize.DefaultFactory(i_want_broken_xhtml_support=True))\r\n          b.set_handle_robots(False)\r\n          b.addheaders = [('User-agent','Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)')]\r\n          b.open('http://reddit.com')\r\n          b.select_form(nr=1)\r\n          b['user']='your_username'\r\n          b['password']='password'\r\n          b.submit()\r\n          b.response().read().index('your_username')\r\n\r\nnow you open up ipython and give it a try.\r\n\r\nThat's all trivial recreation though. The real power will be felt as more high-quality chat-bots come online (really a totally different type of \"bot\"). They are already making inroads on the networking sites' email and msn/aim. They are well-known to push conversion rates through the roof when selling certain products.\r\n\r\nWill be reddit next? Now that will be funny. There was already a flamage bot on usenet years ago if I recall.. There could be bots among us already!

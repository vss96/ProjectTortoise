Thankfully there is more to the world than America and there are those of us American Christians who chose not to follow the 'American' god.\r\n\r\nHe (the American god) is just a god of convenience really. He makes no demands other than that you give up the things that are easy to give up. Other than that you can continue to hate, and be selfish, and he's like a genie that you call upon when you need something really bad.\r\n\r\nBut that's not the God that all of us follow and that is not the God represented by the Bible. Yeah, I'm sorry that American Christianity is such a sham, but just because people want to hijack his name doesn't change God himself.\r\n\r\nI still hold that it is pretty damn hard to be a Christian, 'follower of Christ', if you don't follow his commands.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_td06","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4000-209aa478-902b-4d13-bbbe-3a2dc59cb648-1566236759"}

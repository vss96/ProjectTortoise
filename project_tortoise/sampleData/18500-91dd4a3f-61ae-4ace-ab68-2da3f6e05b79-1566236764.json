Wearing it one my hand all day would make me nauseous because I would be reminded constantly of what a waste of money it was. Also, it is a status symbol meant to inform people of your wealth based on the size of your diamond.  That's not the kind of life I want; I have no need to get my self worth from what other people think. \r\n\r\nBeing given a ring as a sign of commitment or love is a lovely idea. Having something on your hand that reminds you of the person you are in love with is wonderful. A $100 silver ring would serve that purpose for me better than a flashy and expensive diamond.\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u6tj","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808167,"author":"anonymgrl","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu8hm","id":"cu8ox","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18500-91dd4a3f-61ae-4ace-ab68-2da3f6e05b79-1566236764"}

But it got no votes.  So I'm linking to it here.\r\n\r\nWhy gold rather than other currencies (euro, yen, etc)?  Because the people who issue those other currencies have strong political incentives not to let them move too much against the dollar.  If the euro goes up to 1.50, Airbus goes bust.  Sarkozy in France is already railing against the ECB.\r\n\r\nWhy gold rather than other resources?  Well, I wouldn't sniff at base metals and energy - they are a good way to diversify.  Other precious metals are also worth a look.  \r\n\r\nBut the demand for a store of savings tends to focus on one commodity, which traditionally becomes money.  Cultural rather than physical factors drive this process of path-dependent selection: in other words, the market chooses gold, rather than, say, palladium, just because gold is traditional.  Other commodities are likely to shed their savings demand and revert to pricing based on direct industrial demand.  Ie, go down.\r\n\r\nOf course, this process is likely to happen only well after the market realizes that prices of restricted natural resources are outperforming all paper investments.  All restricted commodities (ie, not, for example, sugar) are likely to do pretty well for a while.\r\n\r\nDo not buy gold futures or unallocated gold.  See the comments on Cassandra's post for why.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ve7i","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39175-72a092ef-cb7a-408b-96b0-cee3f8930810-1566236773"}

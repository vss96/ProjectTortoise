If drugs were legal in the US, large corporations would be farming Afghanistan, Colombia, etc. instead of cartels; arguably these countries would be better off for it.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166473210,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_v81w","edited":false,"id":"cv9go","author":"crake","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808858,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36637-8a68389b-087e-4405-ac7b-0093a8866d5a-1566236772"}

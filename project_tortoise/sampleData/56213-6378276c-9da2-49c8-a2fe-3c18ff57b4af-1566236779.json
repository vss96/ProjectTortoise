I can see your point.  However, imagine that you've got your degree in Unicornology and you're an ardent Unicornist.  The Unicornist church has a lot of history and not always obvious dogma.  \r\n\r\nNow, if someone comes along and criticizes your church and starts justifying it by telling you things about your own church you know aren't true, are you going to listen to them?  Especially when they start characterizing Unicornists in a way that you know is plainly false and/or exaggerated?\r\n\r\nBefore you call foul on this, consider that Dawkins and Sam Harris both ardently maintain that anyone involved with a religion isn't allowed to question it.  They also strongly imply that anyone who follows a religion is incapable of rational thought.  These are gave misconceptions about both the organization of most religions and also their followers.  Sure, there are nutjobs out there, but those are far from the majority.  There's a degree of truth to what they say, which is why it seems plausible, but they're fundamentally straw men.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, before I tell you Unicorns don't exist, I should probably know what it is you believe even if it's obvious to me they don't exist.\r\n\r\nEDIT: That got a bit too much into credibility and not the argument of it itself.  I can see your point why you would consider it a non-subject.  I just don't think that insisting there isn't a god let's you bypass knowing what it is you're saying doesn't exist.","retrieved_on":1473809589,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cwbor","parent_id":"t1_cwb9j","author_flair_text":null,"author":"teamjimmyy","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56213-6378276c-9da2-49c8-a2fe-3c18ff57b4af-1566236779"}

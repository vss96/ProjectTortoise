The interesting question if we can do something about it.\r\n\r\nIt is important to realize that nature survives. I am not so much impressed by the argument of so many species going extinct just as an argument. Nature survives. \r\n\r\nThe real issue is what global warming means for humanity. We have to deal with its effects on the short term. That includes spreading of insects and parasites that decrease the harvests, growing of deserts. We might be facing a food problem. Then there is rising of the sea level. \r\n\r\nIf there are species going extinct, then it is a pity for the people now who take interest in those species, or it is a pity for the people who in some way could use those species as a source for medicine or whatever. But nature will be fine, it has all the time left to recover and evolve until the sun stops shining (which happens in about 5 billion years).\r\n\r\nSo it really does not matter if you \"believe\" if humans caused global warming or not. It better be, because then we are able to reverse it. If it is part of a natural cycle, then it is much harder to reverse the effects. And it is either that or try to adapt to the changed climate. Both will not be easy.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166792396,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45252-dc0cb633-8ca4-4b96-9652-0178a97acce4-1566236774"}

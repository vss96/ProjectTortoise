{"body":"If I understand this correctly, tcmalloc never returns memory to the system until a process is closed. It seems to just move freed objects into a list that can, under certain circumstances, get handed back to the heap but the application never actually deallocates memory.  \r\n\r\nIs this assessment correct?  That seems like noteworthy limitation but certainly helps explain the performance benefit (cuts down on context switches).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_u983","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165716944,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jrbattin","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u983","id":"cuae2","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808200,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19454-00db297b-3b46-47cb-91e8-e8d5e5c4b603-1566236764"}

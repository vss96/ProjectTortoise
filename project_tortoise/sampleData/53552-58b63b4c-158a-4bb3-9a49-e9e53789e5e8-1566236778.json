They didn't actually show one firing, just the contraption and then a shot of paper targets getting holes in them.\r\n\r\nAlso the accuracy can't be that great with spherical projectiles.  The part where they show the hollowpoint ammo is another hole in their story.  The projectile wouldn't fly straight at ALL and has a low probability of actually landing with the \"point\" pointing forward.\r\n\r\nTotal lies.","retrieved_on":1473809491,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw6hi","parent_id":"t1_cw53q","author_flair_text":null,"author":"zhyla","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53552-58b63b4c-158a-4bb3-9a49-e9e53789e5e8-1566236778"}

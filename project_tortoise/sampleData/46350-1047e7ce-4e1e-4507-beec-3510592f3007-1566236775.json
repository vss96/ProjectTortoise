We live in a chaotic world, and every local decision has global consequences after a while. I don't think there's something sacred in the humanless nature, as opposed to man-modified world. We are doing some stupid and cruel stuffs, but it's not a necessary part of agriculture.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine that one day, we decide to stop farming cattle. We'd be able to nourish all 6 billion humans with half of today's farming surface and resources. Is it what we'd do? I don't think so, I rather guess that we'd soon become 15 billion (or whatever exact figure, only the principle matters) and occupy all the available space again. Because that's what nature \"wants\" us to do as a species: compete with others, and use all the resources we can accaparate. Billions of years of Darwinian selection make diehard habits.\r\n\r\nWe as human aren't ennemies of nature, we're an integral (and interesting) part of it. If we screw up (and I'm sure we won't), it wouldn't be us destroying nature, it would be nature having a fatal bug.\r\n\r\n","created_utc":1166827196,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46350-1047e7ce-4e1e-4507-beec-3510592f3007-1566236775"}

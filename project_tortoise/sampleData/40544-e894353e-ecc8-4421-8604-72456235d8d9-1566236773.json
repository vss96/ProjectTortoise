Start labelling people as less than fully human. It is also dumb. Put to one side for a second the chance that he was not a ‘vicious killer’. Assume that he is. How did you get to ‘no conscience’? What is the evidence for that? Someone who is willing to die for a cause may well have the opposite problem, too much conscience. They may be so desperate to ‘help’ their people or religion that they have become blinded to the humanity on the other side, whom they in turn may label as ‘without conscience’ because it makes it easier to do what they believe is the right thing.\r\n\r\nIf you want to outwit terrorism you have to think about why your opponent does what he does. I’m sure Sun Tzu or somebody like him probably said something similar if that makes things more digestible for you.\r\n\r\nEdit: Found it. And more apposite than I thought:\r\n\r\n&gt;So it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle. - Sun Tzu 'The Art of War'","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vcii","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40544-e894353e-ecc8-4421-8604-72456235d8d9-1566236773"}

There is no one \"smartest\" person, because intelligence is not a one-dimensional attribute.  Two smart people will have different strengths and weaknesses.  Even if you set two people the same problem, say, writing an application to solve something, there could be numerous different approaches that all involve different sets of trade-offs.  Who's smarter, the Oracle guys or MySQL guys or PostGreSQL guys?  Linux guys or FreeBSD guys or Solaris guys?\r\n\r\nAdditionally. in a skilled profession, an experienced person of modest intelligence will have the knowledge to outperform a newcomer of high intelligence.  It's the same with plumbing, being an electrician, or playing chess.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12398-2054a743-d408-4bec-b857-442c9da675c6-1566236762"}

{"body":"The problem has more to do with the fact that US roadways and towns are not structured to be ridden on by bicycles.  Commutes tend to be too long to ride on a daily basis and on top of that bike paths to and from anything useful are not all that common.  Sidewalks are reserved for pedestrians.  Road shoulders are often covered with tire-puncturing debris.  Crosswalks are an afterthought and somewhat treacherous since most places allow cars to turn right on red or left without a green arrow, so there is never a guaranteed safe time to cross.  Bike racks aren't around every building and bike theft is rampant.  Roads that span any reasonable distance are often narrow with a 45MPH speed limit and filled with angry motorists.  In urban areas it's more common to see bicycles, but in many cases it's much more dangerous than walking (and people do walk quite a bit in urban areas).\r\n\r\nThis is coming from a recreational cyclist in the US who tried to ride to work 5 miles away in the suburbs only to find it impossible to find a safe route there.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t8ou","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165004374,"author":"inkieminstrel","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ct9v0","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct97b","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807514,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2011-9b2b3cdd-8dcb-4b40-9b1e-ae13ee289a19-1566236758"}

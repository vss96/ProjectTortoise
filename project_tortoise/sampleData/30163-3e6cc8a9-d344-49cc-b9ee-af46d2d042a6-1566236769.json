Well, at least misspelled.\r\n\r\nIf you want to unilaterally use unconventional spellings for words, that's entirely your perogative. But unless you append each of your postings on the internet with a footnote linking back to a page where you list those words you have decided to spell differently, people reading your words might think you don't know or care about such things and judge your words accordingly.\r\n\r\nOf course, if we standardised such a system of footnotes and pages, we could all have software which grabbed the author's preferred spelling page and translated into our preferred spelling for display.\r\n\r\nOr we could avoid that effort and just agree on a common means of communication. Perhaps there would be a market for big books of words, containing the most common ways to spell words? Or one of these bright web 2.0 people could create an internet web site where we could check such things?","controversiality":0,"score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166181890,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30163-3e6cc8a9-d344-49cc-b9ee-af46d2d042a6-1566236769"}

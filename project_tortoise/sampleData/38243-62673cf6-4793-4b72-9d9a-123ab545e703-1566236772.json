At least at school there is a decent chance of the school nurse being able to help. Young girls who get pregnant often feel like they have absolutely no where to turn. Not family, not friends, not anyone:\r\n\r\nhttp://reddit.com/info/truq/comments\r\n\r\nI'm in love with the way the UK folks are seeming to handle this, in complete contrast with what I've seen in US schools:\r\n\r\n&gt; \"It is **not going to help to go moralising** on the whole situation. That is not important, what is important is that the child and the baby are fine and everything is being done for them and their parents.\"\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Mr Grady said the head teacher had met the girl's mother and **preparations had been made for her to return to school and continue with her education**. \r\n\r\nBut can we seriously get past *this* nonsense?

We had a very similar situation from WW1 to the Great Depression - Britain was the world's superpower, held the global reserve currency, yet new emerging economies (notably the U.S.) were beginning to rival it and trade directly with other European powers.  The British economy actually started to sink well before the stock market crash - if you read old newspapers from the summer of 1929, there are many stories predicting how Europe will undergo continuing stagnation, but the likelihood of it spreading to the U.S. is slight.\r\n\r\nYet when the crash actually came, it hit the U.S. much harder than Britain.  Largely this was because a stagnating European economy depressed grain prices, which hurt U.S. farm exports and bankrupted farmers already stung by the dust bowl.  Farmers made up a significantly larger sector of the economy then.  Since their prices were dropping, they couldn't buy other goods, which caused a deflationary spiral which hurt them even more, since many were debt holders and had to pay their mortgages with dearer dollars.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Britain recovered quickly by letting the pound devalue and effectively defaulting on their currency .  Tthey went off the gold standard.  If the historical analogy holds (always a risky supposition), then a likely outcome is that the U.S. will default on its credit obligations and take whatever monetary measures are necessary to stimulate the consumer economy.  Perhaps T-bills are not \"risk free\" after all.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vc4j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38590-c34aa504-de18-4f11-bed5-44b4eb93e4d8-1566236773"}

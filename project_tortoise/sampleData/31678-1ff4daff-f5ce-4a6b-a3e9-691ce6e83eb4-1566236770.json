It illustrates a nice comparison between publicly funded health care like the UK's NHS and Canada's health care, compared to privately funded health care like in the US. That's not mentioning that people in the UK, and Canada, spend half as much on health care compared to the US (per capita).\r\n\r\nThe NHS has a lot of problems, and it's short funded thanks to shitty government trying to cut funding, and I'm talking about Labour who are supposed to be pro-NHS unlike the Tories. However it is clearly a far superior system if the people in the UK who are short changed in health care are as good off as the US' rich. I feel quite happy to be more middle class.","created_utc":1166225965,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31678-1ff4daff-f5ce-4a6b-a3e9-691ce6e83eb4-1566236770"}

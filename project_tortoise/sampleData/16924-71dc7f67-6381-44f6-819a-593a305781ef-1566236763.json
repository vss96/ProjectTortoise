Garbage collection, destructors, \"using\", etc. make it possible to have multiple exit paths without having to duplicate cleanup code everywhere.\r\n\r\n&gt; I can't stand people who omit braces around single-line if-block bodies\r\n\r\nIt's pseudo code, and not all languages have to use braces, so I'm not prepared to burn the guy for that.\r\n\r\n&gt; For methods that \"fail\" fairly often, error codes may be more appropriate.\r\n\r\nIt's a semantic thing, but if it \"fails\" fairly often, then you should probably call it a status code rather than an error code. You're right though, exceptions shouldn't be used for such cases, but I don't think the author is suggesting otherwise.","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16924-71dc7f67-6381-44f6-819a-593a305781ef-1566236763"}

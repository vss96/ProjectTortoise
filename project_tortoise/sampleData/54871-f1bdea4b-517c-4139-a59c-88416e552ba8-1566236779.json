From 5th grade, through 2 college music degrees and drum corps. So I'm sure I'm one of the \"Neil Peart is awesome\" lackies.\r\n\r\nLike most drummers, there's always someone more talented. I will say this though. Out of all of the drummers I've seen live, Neil is a machine. 3+ hour sets. Rock solid. Non stop. Very impressive.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe it's time to setup the old kit in the basement and have at some old Rush tunes again. Nothing like a round of Freewill or Tom Sawyer riffs to get the blood moving.  :-)","link_id":"t3_w8tk","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809540,"distinguished":null,"author":"claco","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cw90u","parent_id":"t3_w8tk","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54871-f1bdea4b-517c-4139-a59c-88416e552ba8-1566236779"}

The public's will has nothing to do with the Patriot Act, which was waiting in the wings to be foisted onto the Congress in an emergency situation like the 9-11 aftermath. It was passed within days of introduction with no debate. With the Military Comissions Act we got a month long Kabuki Theater in the Republican controlled Senate, and the republicans paid the price for this in both houses in the 2006 election. Karl Rove thought the MCA was a slam dunk that the nation would get behind, associating the republicans with strongman safety, but it completely backfired as election results showed. Both of these atrocious pieces of legislation were forced onto the public, quickly , nastily and by republican dominated congresses.\r\n\r\nWhile libertarian Paul Hager has made the case in his *The Drug War and the Constitution*, that \"the War on Drugs\" is an illegal form of prohibition, which violates the principles of a limited government embodied in Constitution, there is nothing there about measuring \"The Drug War\" and other legislations by their death toll as bogdon6 has attempted to do. \r\n\r\nFurther the \"War on Drugs\" fiasco has roots in legislation of 1880 with gradual tightenings and rhetorical ramp ups via Nixon, the end of Reagan's term, and the start of Bush I's term. This was not a power grab in the middle of the night. This was a slow boiling process. And while there are some parallels to the encroachments on rights and privacies, one did not set the stage for the other. No Congressman or Senator sat around and tried to justify their vote for either of the Patriot Act or the Military Commissions Act based on their admiration for current drug law. And while the \"Drug War\" has certainly contributed to a national \"militarizing\" of the police force, drug suspects have access to full due process and restitution through the Constitution based court system. The Military Commissions Acts and the Patriot Act from which it stems, strips Habeas Corpus rights completely from the accused, and worse the executive itself has no test other than its own opinion to determine who it can strip those rights from. \r\n\r\n\"The Drug War\" is a disaster and has had decades of abuse to show its damage to the public. These new pieces of legislation are far far worse and have had much less time to be misused as well as much less light thrown on them so that the public can see their consequences. \r\n\r\nThere is no question that the Patriot Act and MCA are far greater dangers to the Constitution itself than the \"Drug War\" legislation. While the Drug War erodes rights within the framework by violating aspects of the Constitution, the Patriot and MCA do away with the Constitution itself, solely at the discretion of the executive or its appointees. There is no comparison on a Constitutional level here, which used to be the standard by which libertarians made decisions.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809270,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvut9","parent_id":"t1_cvu9r","author":"smacfarl","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47443-cc5fe0d6-dc9a-4549-b159-939621218032-1566236775"}

Being a fellow English man I found it impossible to believe a bus could ever work. You could get to within 5 minutes of anywhere you wanted to be with two busses, and usually only a few minutes to wait in between to catch a (free) transfer.\r\n\r\nI was amazed, I would rather spend 40 minutes walking between my home and college than catching the bus, because that usually takes 40 minutes to get it and then 20 minutes to get there. I don't know how, but I think they're using a scooter engine because I've never seen vehicles accelerate so slowly, milk carts are faster.\r\n\r\nCity-city travel should always be train, especially in the UK where they're so closely packed because it enables smaller trains to run at off-peak times to make them more efficient. My local train has about 6 carraiges, you could get all the people into 1, perhaps 2 at lunch time.\r\n\r\nThe problem with UK busses and trains are that the bus seats 72 people, WTF it usually has 8 old ladies on it who I swear to god are glued to those seats. The trains are even worse they have like 300 seats and only about 20 people on them.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tocm","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807842,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","id":"ctrc9","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctqm7","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10086-fb1aef79-8266-4273-bfcc-12cec3f47b11-1566236761"}

They aren't rebranding other people's chocolates.\r\n\r\nIf Noka was simply taking Godiva chocolate and selling it straight up as Noka chocolate for 10 times the price, then your example would be correct.\r\n\r\nEdit: I feel the need to expand on this a little.  Yes, they probably buy their chocolate from the mfrs that take it from beans, but they do their own processing on it as well.   It might be as little as melting and pouring it into molds or making candies out of it, but it's more than simply scratching out the MSRP name and replacing it with their own.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't buy their chocolates, but that doesn't make what they do fraud.","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57796-b82aebd3-63c5-4576-a016-7eba472cd949-1566236780"}

It's a downward spiral, aid enters the country and destroys local markets for food, which causes farmers to abandon land and become dependant on the aid. There are now fewer local farms producing food so the next time there's a drought the crisis becomes even more severe and more aid arrives.\r\n\r\nNow there is a pool of unemployed people who are dependant on food imports, a ready supply of soldiers for whichever local nutcase decides he wants power. It's no surprise that violence is continually flaring up in areas which are supplied with aid.\r\n\r\nWe have to stop \"helping\" them and start trading with them. Keep aid to an *absolute minimum*. Then remove the subsidies to our farmers and import tariffs. They can have our money as long as they give us products to pay for it.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vurq","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166973363,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48526-b44438eb-754c-4c59-ace7-6bc51a738e3d-1566236777"}

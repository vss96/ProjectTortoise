{"body":"IMHO, the state/municipality has no legitimate need to tax such transactions. They supply no law-enforcement for the business, no fire protection, no street services.\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nAmazon (for instance) and I settle on a transaction and the item is sent via USPS, which I pay for. States/municipalities want to charge tax on the transaction simply because they believe they can get away with it.\r\n\r\nThis has not been a \"loophole,\" but simply people avoiding paying an unjust tax.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there will be some big guns fighting this -- I hope they win.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_txoc","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165604681,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"DA5lD","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu52o","id":"cu5hz","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808107,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16684-84633a8c-e97d-4256-909d-12caca487971-1566236763"}

It takes normal futuristic pipe dreams and randomly inserts the word \"RFID\" somewhere:\r\n&gt;A boon for first-time moms - RFID-enabled baby changing tables and cribs that show you how to take care of newborns and toddlers\r\n\r\nWtf good would putting RFID technology in this device do?  Would the table scan the baby and then be able to confirm that it is, in fact, a baby?\r\n\r\nA significant portion of these aren't \"RFID\", but just \"RF\".  RF devices can transmit a wide variety of information back on the signal (I work for a company that builds devices that transmit pressure information).  The \"ID\" part comes in when all the device transmits back is an identification number.  If it transmits data that describes the object, instead of identifies it, it *is not RFID*.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u4c2","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808094,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"praetorian42","edited":false,"id":"cu4ua","parent_id":"t3_u4c2","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16294-204a249e-72bf-46a2-8ed5-bed2ac5deebd-1566236763"}

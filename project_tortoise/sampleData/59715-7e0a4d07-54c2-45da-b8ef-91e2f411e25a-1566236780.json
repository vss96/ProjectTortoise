To those that do not understand that there was no loss to anyone when the car was restored, because they had not labored and then failed to be paid. If you feed yourself with your hand you are not cheating the maker of knifes and forks or ripping off McDonald's by cooking your own hamburger.

To those that don't know where to start the process of wealth building, Just stand on the street and listen.  When you hear a complaint, you are on notice that there is an unhappy customer looking for a better product or service. There is your start-up. Here is your first complaint.

{"body":"One can read the history also differently: Many (or most) humans have an urge for religious experiences, for transcending their banal and boring lifes, for purpose.  That's why there have been so few human societies without some sort of religion.  \r\n\r\nYou cannot forcefully take away religion from (most) people without filling in something different.  Something which provides this feeling of purpose.  Perhaps: \"You help build the communist society where there is no suppression and people have to work only when they wish.\"  Or: \"You contribute to our nation's wealth and prosperity and fate.\" Hate also works: \"Your life has the purpose to kill the enemy.\" \r\n\r\nAn atheist could speculate: The currently existing religions are believe systems that fill this urge for pupose of humans while enabling them to build working societies.  \r\n\r\nTake the \"religion\" fascism/communism: \"Your people and your FÃ¼hrer are all-important, the individual and his rights a not important.\"  Simply did not lead to a sustainable society.\r\n\r\nToday, many western societies are going in the opposite direction: \"You are all-important.  The others are just there to fill your needs.  Consume!\"  (I'm oversimplifying, of course.)  It's unclear how sustainable that is.\r\n\r\nOverall and generally speaking, the existing religions exhibit an astonishing amount of wisdom over how humans work.  How societies can work.  How our psyche works. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the reddit-atheists have a remarkably simple image of humans: Just take away religion and then we all can act rationally and that's the best for everyone. \r\n\r\nMaybe it would be.  It's just not how humans work.  Humans act irrationally all the time.  They love, hate, kill, are hurt and hurt others.  They feel strange things such as guilt and shame.  And they have this wish for unconditional power.  In particular concerning the last point the currently existing religions provide some answers and guidelines.  (Remember: otherwise these religions would be extinct.)  That gives them some value, from a purely utilitaristic viewpoint.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx5n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167005775,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mheiler","edited":false,"id":"cvya1","parent_id":"t1_cvxic","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809334,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49186-43aa6240-9121-45ea-a515-f2ba1fcd830b-1566236777"}

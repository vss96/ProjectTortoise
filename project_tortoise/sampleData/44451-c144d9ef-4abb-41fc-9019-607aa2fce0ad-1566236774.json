I can easily have four instances of Firefox running at once, or two instances of Firefox (one for main reading, one for looking up in Wikipedia/dictionaries etc.) while having a word processor _and_ something else (calculator, scratchpad) running on the right-hand side of the monitor. Two of these would be even better, of course, but I would think that even one of these works out better than two smaller monitors. You don't have to worry about programs hitting the border. It currently costs about 1300$ (froogle) . You would probably get about the same monitor area if you split that money across two monitors. So I guess that puts the question down to a matter of taste.\r\n\r\n(What this monitor is really stellar for, of course, is low-paced gaming, like flight simulators. There isn't noticeable ghosting, but you do notice the fact that it takes some time to update. I feel like I am losing focus for an instant if I do a lot of sudden moves)","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44451-c144d9ef-4abb-41fc-9019-607aa2fce0ad-1566236774"}

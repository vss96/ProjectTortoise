There is no physical trauma in seeing something, just knowledge gained. Watching a video is not an advocation of his hanging, just bearing witness. Events such as this hanging happen all the time throughout history, and the people who bore witness to these events, remembered them, and learned from them have been the ones who would go on to effect the changes that have made our society civil to the point where we can be so detached from death.\r\n\r\nReality *is* often sad. Sometimes events can happen that make entire populations sad, or even angry. As participants in life on Earth, we are subject to these sorts of things. If you avoid seeing important events because they make you sad, why not avoid reading about them as well? Why not totally isolate yourself from the sometimes awful truth of reality in our time?","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59447-d1988881-4c43-4805-8352-558f3a8ab850-1566236780"}

Apophis will pass harmlessly in 2031 but, depending on where it is exactly on the flyby, may or may not hit in 2036.\r\n\r\n[1950-DA](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/296/5565/132?ijkey=l3UqQyiMxYRmM&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci) has a higher probability of hitting (.3%) in 2880. Whether it hits or not depends on what it's made of and how it interacts with the earth's gravitational field as it flies by several times between now and then. \r\n\r\n1950-DA was co-discovered by the radar at Aceribo which is currently slated to be shut down. \r\n\r\nSeems to me we ought to be testing asteroid deflection strategies now before we end up actually need a working technique. It's just a matter of time before an asteroid or comet turns up headed straight at us. Unlike the dinosaurs, we can actually do something about it.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w9u0","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809557,"author":"nobodyspecial","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w9u0","id":"cw9xf","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55298-d8856f8a-80ee-4c28-9474-a583f82a5a49-1566236779"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Yes, here's where we run into the fuzzy bits.\r\n\r\nOnline services are starting to replace hard-copy materials, with online information frequently used by people who never crack a 'peer reviewed' printed publication.  In this case, the hard copy printed map would have had a warning to inform drivers that the road was dangerous / impassible in Winter, whereas the \"it'll do\" online version did not have that information and (possibly || actually) recommended the user take that dangerous route.\r\n\r\nIf online businesses are assuming a role previously held by print publications, shouldn't they be held to the same standard of quality?  People don't buy hard copy maps when they can get their \"information\" for free, and cartographers will be put out of business by an online competitor which is not held to the same standard of quality.\r\n\r\nWhenever I find myself in an remote, unsupervised park or other dangerous area, I'll see a sign which provides a stark warning along the lines of \"Be Careful:  People Have Died Here\"\r\n\r\nIf Google Maps isn't to be held to the same cartographic standards as printed maps, I think the \"driving directions\" option should have a clear warning:  \"This information may not be valid.  People have died following this advice.\"","link_id":"t3_u3q9","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165604950,"score":7,"ups":7,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu5j5","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu5aw","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808108,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16702-2a361b72-63bc-4896-91bb-0221d3ed6b07-1566236763"}

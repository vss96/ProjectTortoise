If the constitution can be rewritten to include the right to bear arms, it could presumably just as easily be rewritten to take it out again.  At least it could if it weren't for the fanatical opposition there would be to such a move.","link_id":"t3_u9bd","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808190,"distinguished":null,"author":"muttleee","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu9si","id":"cu9v9","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19176-02e6b834-5e1b-4def-8148-145c482bf52e-1566236764"}

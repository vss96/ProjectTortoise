{"controversiality":1,"body":"The end of Sadaam is good.  But had we been smarter about it and the world agreed, we could have led a fairer, less arrogant campaign and had others take out key areas and give them deals.  Instead it was greed fueled, advantageous from 9/11, arrogant, torturous, etc on and on. Bush missed an opportunity to capture Bin Laden and make the fall of Sadaam a real world victory but it has been run wrong in PR all along.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wf9e","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1167472619,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"drawkbox","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwg48","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwfv6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809672,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58463-ea96035c-c972-44bc-a404-af1642f31e8f-1566236780"}

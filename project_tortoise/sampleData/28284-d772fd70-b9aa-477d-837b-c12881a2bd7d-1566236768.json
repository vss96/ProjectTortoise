The answer to why so few women are in I.T. is, in all honesty, quite simple and very human.  The whole hostile environment is a bunch of B.S. for anyone who has worked with a female in the I.T. world (bunch of nerds love having women around)\r\n\r\nMen and women have differences, both physical and mental.  Accept this and move on.  Not to generalize, because there are obvious exceptions, but a large number of women don't like or do very well at math.  According to scientists studying the sexes, men seem to have an easier time with math.  No, I have no idea why, Google for answers.\r\n\r\nI loath math.  I'm not female, but I've never really been crazy about it.  When I went to college, and had to decide on my future goal, I picked business.  Computer science was full of required math courses.  I call it crap because most people who graduate with CS degrees will only need to know basic algebra in their future positions (they are sitting behind a giant calculator for gods sake!).  After you get past those basic courses in computers, which everyone has to take at most schools, you will notice a HUGE decline in the number of females in the classes.  In my business classes: full of em. \r\n\r\nI don't think schools will change the math course requirements for their computer science curriculum, but I can almost guarantee you that if they did you would notice an increase in females.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_urzo","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28284-d772fd70-b9aa-477d-837b-c12881a2bd7d-1566236768"}

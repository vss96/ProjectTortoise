{"body":"In 7th grade one of my friends got the crap beaten out of him by 3 high schoolers with a good 50 witnesses.  He curled into a ball in the corner to minimize the damage and didn't throw a single punch.  The bullies got a pretty hefty punishment, but my friend got a 3 day in-school suspension just for being involved in the \"fight.\"\r\n\r\nIn retrospect we all should have helped, though considering I had been stabbed earlier that year, I was pretty much afraid.  On top of that, the message was clearly sent that had any of us helped we would have been suspended also.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w4pi","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1167250227,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"inkieminstrel","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw6ki","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw6dy","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809493,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53606-e97a71c8-83ba-431b-bb19-b632c0a077f2-1566236778"}

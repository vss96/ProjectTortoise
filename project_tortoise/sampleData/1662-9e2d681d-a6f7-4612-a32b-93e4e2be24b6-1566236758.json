The history of the USD's exchange rate against those is more mixed - the yuan doesn't float, the yen has been sliding since January of 2005, the USD appears to be up against the peso, and the Canadian dollar has been gaining value for 5 years now.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1662-9e2d681d-a6f7-4612-a32b-93e4e2be24b6-1566236758"}

TDTD offers great static analysis and performance monitoring of my Java apps, which is amazingly useful.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I like in VS.NET more than Eclipse is the debugger. It just feels better. I also like those new tooltips for object visualization.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Thought I should mention that IntelliJ, which I've only recently started playing around with, also seems to be better. It's a real coder's IDE. Lots of tiny time-saving features that are done right. Just take a look at the equals overriding (it automatically adds comparisons for the member variables you choose). My next project will definitely be spent with it.","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1166161000,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29826-bb0052ca-4332-4df2-b8c4-117d54910e3f-1566236769"}

{"body":"\"Beach volleyball has strict rules dictating what constitutes proper attire. Women can wear one- or two-piece uniforms, and that usually means they play in bikinis and sunglasses.\"\r\n\r\nWhat possible reason could there be for attire rules for beach volleyball?  As long as there aren't bits that flail out beyond the reaches of one's limbs,  full-body suits (with skirts and/or blousier tops) don't seem unreasonable.  Even a head covering with a full-face opening doesn't seem out of the question.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_teha","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":3,"score":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165123432,"author":"oatsy","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctf3p","parent_id":"t3_teha","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807613,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4516-cbed3afb-1000-42a0-8686-f3f193871cc6-1566236759"}

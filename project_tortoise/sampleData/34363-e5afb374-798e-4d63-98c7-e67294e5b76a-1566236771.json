Bringing a lawsuit to court would almost certainly make his identity public.\r\n\r\nOf course, he's fooling himself if he thinks it'll be a secret from the police force for long. The officers involved in this incident will recognize themselves as soon as they see the video, and they have his name and license number on record.\r\n\r\nGood for him, though. I hope he keeps it up.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808774,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cv4qa","id":"cv4xg","edited":false,"author":"diamond","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34363-e5afb374-798e-4d63-98c7-e67294e5b76a-1566236771"}

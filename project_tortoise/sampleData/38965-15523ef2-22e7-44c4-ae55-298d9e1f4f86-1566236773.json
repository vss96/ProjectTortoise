{"body":"Bullshit.  The federal government has the power over the purse--they can choose to cut federal spending, end the war in Iraq (a war that is on its way to costing $1 Trillion) and rein in the regulators who are running up the costs in so many industries.  Frankly, a cut in defense spending (not the increase in spending, but ACTUAL cuts) and a federal layoff of bureaucrats would be ugly as hell, but is the one thing that could save the US.\r\n\r\nI don't know if any of this is politically feasible, but the alternative (bankruptcy and probably civil war) is an even steeper cliff, so somebody better do something soon besides try to buy votes with handouts paid for by money we don't have.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vdbm","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166554621,"score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_cvdz5","edited":false,"id":"cve4k","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808947,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38965-15523ef2-22e7-44c4-ae55-298d9e1f4f86-1566236773"}

The purpose of a window manager isn't to turn the screen into hanging art, it's to elegantly provide functionality you want and get out of your way as much as possible.\r\n\r\nEnlightenment used to look 'pretty' but many of its themes were horribly impractical. I feel similarly about Mac OS X - it's gaudy. KDE is even worse - I think it looks like it's been targetted at four year olds. Window managers that stand out make put me in mind of Windows applications that insist on putting their own entries in the desktop's right-click menu, or icons in the status bar. They're showing off to the detriment of their users.\r\n\r\nGnome is responsive and tends to be simple, and I think that's a good approach. As this author mentions, the version that comes with Ubuntu looks OK, also.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809402,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw1u9","parent_id":"t3_w1n2","author_flair_text":null,"author":"cratuki","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50988-e13f65d3-218a-4fdf-8059-b53547a7cd7e-1566236778"}

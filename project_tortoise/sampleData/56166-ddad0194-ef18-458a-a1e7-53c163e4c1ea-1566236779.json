Asking \"What is the ratio between the speed of light and infinity?\" is a mistake. It's like asking \"What the ratio between the speed of light and a duck?\" It doesn't mean anything.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56166-ddad0194-ef18-458a-a1e7-53c163e4c1ea-1566236779"}

To single-out America is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThis is a nonsensical statement for at least three reasons.\r\n\r\n- America loves to take the moral high ground on every issue imaginable, acting as the world's policeman, \"exporting\" democracy, criticizing other countries for their human rights record. Militarily if not morally it is a very powerful nation, which still has great influence in the world. By implication of it's own assertions and actions it can and should be held to a higher standard than any other country.\r\n\r\n- From a humanist moral standpoint your statement is sickening. A bad/evil thing occuring in many other countries does not make it okay to do it in your own country. The documentary does not \"single out\" America; it is simply about America. It is quite normal for a documentary to focus on a specific issue.\r\n\r\n- Finally your statement is simply not true. Torture is most certainly *not* common in prisons in Norway, Sweden, Denmark &amp; the Netherlands, to name just a few countries. Check with Amnesty International if you like.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808258,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cudht","parent_id":"t1_cucv0","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21101-65d87ea3-54fd-48d5-bcee-1b34e65ffda1-1566236765"}

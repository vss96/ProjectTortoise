You notice that most social software really isn't \"social\" in the sense of having presence, status updates, real-time messaging, real-time updates, and so on?  And the user experience consists of page-by-page refreshes with no support for spawning background tasks that act as agents on the user's behalf?  There's a reason that nobody's built an IDE for the web...\r\n\r\nNote that most of the proposals for rectifying this essentially implement message-passing in clumsier ways.  SOA is all about messages and requests, they just happen to be in XML (ick).  Communication via database just takes the DB server as a process and SQL as a message format.  You probably *don't* really need concurrency beyond the database (well, some sort of event system would be nice too), but you probably do need more lightweight database equivalents.\r\n\r\nErlang doesn't make anything possible that wasn't possible before.  It does make things *easier* - or would if it didn't substitute other hassles.","link_id":"t3_t8l4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164990919,"score":5,"ups":5,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1418-92648f48-4078-4ad5-bddc-e3545e25ea33-1566236758"}

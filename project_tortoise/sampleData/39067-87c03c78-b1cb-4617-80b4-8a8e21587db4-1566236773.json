Apparently it is a precept of their religious faith that man and women remain separate, including on buses - and believing that, they beat this women because she didn't comply.\r\n\r\nIt's also obvious that not all Jews believe this, and not all Jews behave like this. But I think your comments show a blindness in the opposite direction: that Jews (and any other religious/racial group) can and do behave badly on occasion because of their beliefs.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vat3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39067-87c03c78-b1cb-4617-80b4-8a8e21587db4-1566236773"}

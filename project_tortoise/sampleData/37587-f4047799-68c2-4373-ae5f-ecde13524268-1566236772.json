Some clarification in the headline here to counter the default assumption would make it much less misleading and save people not interested in the story from clicking through, thinking it was something else, and downvoting afterwards.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808894,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_v80m","id":"cvbb3","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"kamikasei","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37587-f4047799-68c2-4373-ae5f-ecde13524268-1566236772"}

Still, the video makes a pretty weak case for the importance of that interaction in personality and memory.\r\n\r\nAccording to the video, only 5-10% of transplant recipients report a change in personality.  The video also notes that of more than 70 people who were interviewed about those changes, 10 were deemed sufficiently notable to warrant inclusion in [the study by Drs. Pearsall and Schwartz](http://www.springerlink.com/content/k51335l4k4676577/) (the paper for which involves itself almost entirely in reporting anecdotes from the donors' families and the recipients, with no substantial analysis).\r\n\r\nAltogether then, roughly 1% of transplant patients report changes that can be correlated with the donor.

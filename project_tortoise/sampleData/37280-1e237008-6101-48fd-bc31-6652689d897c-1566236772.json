But who are we to judge her intentions? You can never be sure what her intentions were, in today's world. And I can imagine how uncomfortable the children must have been to photograph her. I mean, accidently looking at someone is one thing, but I'm sure the kids weren't all too willing to photograph their mother nude. The way I see it, she should've been sentenced. If you want to be photographed nude, you make your partner do it, not your child. If you are single and desperate enough to do it, there is something on the camera known as self-timer. Or just go to a photographer, they are there for a reason. Had the authorities let this go with the assumption that the mother had no ill intentions, then I can only imagine how bad the scene would be with people who DO have ill intentions exploiting this incident and using it cover up anything they do similar to this.","link_id":"t3_v93g","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166491643,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37280-1e237008-6101-48fd-bc31-6652689d897c-1566236772"}

In this case, \"Shiny Diamond.\" I support the classification but would say the personal knowledge of something shouldn't be the biggest factor unless you are an expert in the field.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tfak","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":12,"ups":12,"created_utc":1165156827,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"chime","edited":false,"id":"ctg4t","parent_id":"t1_ctfvc","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807633,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4934-a83367cc-203a-45fa-90d8-00831c8c4aae-1566236759"}

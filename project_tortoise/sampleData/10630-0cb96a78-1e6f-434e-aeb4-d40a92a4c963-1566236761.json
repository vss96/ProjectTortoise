In an environment where all employees are doing the same job and thus getting the same pay you would pay more/less depending on the desirability to work on certain days/certain times such as $8/hr for Tuesday and $12/hr on Sundays. Presumably some employees would rather work on Tuesday for less and have Sunday off whereas others would rather have more money and thus work on Sundays.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_toqx","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10630-0cb96a78-1e6f-434e-aeb4-d40a92a4c963-1566236761"}

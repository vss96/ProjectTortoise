Legal businesses such as the gambling and liquor industry know that responsible, non-harmful use of their products is insignificant for their bottom line - the usage distribution is so skewed that the largest profits come from the worst abusers. The institution of the corporation, coupled with this fact, means that CEOs are legally forced to promote harmful use, and can face shareholder lawsuits if they don't. \r\n\r\nWe as a society need a way to deal with this. I like the old teetotaler policy of first and foremost removing the profit motive. They thought that once the profit motive was reduced or eliminated, through mandatory non-profit monopolies for instance, people would realise how harmful and pointless alcohol use would be, and they would support closing down the monopolies entirely (in other words, local bans). It worked great, until some teetotalers got impatient and pushed for national prohibition instead. \r\n\r\nIf that proves effective against alcohol and gambling, we may risk legalisation of use (and criminalisation of for-profit sale) for less harmful products, such as pot, cocaine and opiates. As it is, we simply cannot afford another problem on the scale of alcohol or gambling, which is what legalised drugs would quicly become.","created_utc":1166619416,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40693-c0404134-3421-4f1b-9f52-789339f6549a-1566236773"}

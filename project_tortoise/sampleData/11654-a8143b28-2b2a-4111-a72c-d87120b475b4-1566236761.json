On the other hand, your definition, essentially that \"a bunch of people can decide whether or not someone gets on their air\" is censorship, is so broad as to be completely useless as a definition. By such logic, anyone with a point of view who is not accorded some amount of exposure is somehow being \"censored\". And how does one measure such exposure? How much do you need to NOT be censored? How many minutes of airtime? On what channels, radio stations or websites? How many eyeballs or TV sets must one reach?\r\n\r\nThus spammers are victims of censorship by large ISPs and backbones that filter out their messages; Bad Hollywood writers are censored because the studios won't buy their stories; I am being censored because someone can click the \"hide\" button on my reddit submissions. \r\n\r\nSpam, ironically, is also the best disproof of your point - despite concerted efforts of many of the world's largest telecommunications companies, ISPs and corporations, spammers are still able to get their message out to millions of people.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165421578,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11654-a8143b28-2b2a-4111-a72c-d87120b475b4-1566236761"}

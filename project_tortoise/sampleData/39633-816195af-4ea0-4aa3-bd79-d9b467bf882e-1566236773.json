Despite improvement in both the fiscal year 2006 reported net operating cost and\r\nthe cash-based budget deficit, the U.S. government’s total reported liabilities, net social\r\ninsurance commitments, and other fiscal exposures continue to grow and now total\r\napproximately $50 trillion, representing approximately four times the Nation’s total\r\noutput (GDP) in fiscal year 2006, up from about $20 trillion, or two times GDP in fiscal\r\nyear 2000. As this long-term fiscal imbalance continues to grow, the retirement of the\r\n“baby boom” generation is closer to becoming a reality with the first wave of boomers\r\neligible for early retirement under Social Security in 2008. Given these and other factors,\r\nit seems clear that the nation’s current fiscal path is unsustainable and that tough choices\r\nby the President and the Congress are necessary in order to address the nation’s large and\r\ngrowing long-term fiscal imbalance.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vc4j","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808971,"author":"writetoalok","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cve5k","id":"cvfcf","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39633-816195af-4ea0-4aa3-bd79-d9b467bf882e-1566236773"}

The main reason would be to offer e-commerce vendors extra assurance (they tend to like that, and getting vendors to accept the ID would be a big boost). How it would work, or what it would take to 'verify' an identity I don't know - that would require careful consideration to ensure it could work globally.\r\n\r\nMy apologies for not being clear as to a central authority, I very much like the idea of there not being a central provider. The idea was to have a body that defines the protocol and sets ground rules that provides *should* follow. That body would *not* act as an identity provider itself.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the feedback, you've given me a few things to think about.","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166758965,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44870-5769bf29-ed8f-47db-833f-6c27e67eb007-1566236774"}

The organizations didn't exist, but what was the point in having an anti-gay lobby when virtually no one was suggesting gays should have equal rights?  What's the point in pro-life when abortions are already illegal?\r\n\r\nThe current apparent resurgence of religion in the media is just because they have become marginalized over the last hundred years, and are attempting to fight back.  For example, according to [US census data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_united_states#Popular_affiliation), there are 8% fewer christians than a decade ago, and 6% more atheists than a decade ago.  Doesn't sound like we're becoming overrun by them, regardless of what the blogosphere seems to think.\r\n\r\n&gt; if Einstein truly thought that the proponents of atheism were just working out their childhood issues, that exhibits a profoundly shallow sense of empathy.\r\n\r\nNot sure why you made the substitution \"mostly\" &amp;rArr; \"just\", but yeah, he was renowned for being profoundly shallow.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tivn","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6871-04f1b931-9c56-42e7-a51a-b2aadd5d285a-1566236760"}

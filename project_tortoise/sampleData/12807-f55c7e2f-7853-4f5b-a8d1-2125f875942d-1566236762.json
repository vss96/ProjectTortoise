An airline can have a couple of crashes and survive, still make money.  A major terrorist event can happen and they can get bailed out.  \r\n\r\nThis industry fights Congress on rules regarding pilot work/rest periods which would make our air travel safer, because of money.  I have no reason to believe that measures that might actually be making us safer weren't rejected because of the aviation industry &amp; lobbyists' respect for the bottom line. \r\n\r\nThe measures we have now are a stopgap and a ruse, allowing us to feel safe with a minimum of measures that might make us quit flying, but ensure safety for those who did.\r\n *For those of us who continued to travel by air. edit*","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12807-f55c7e2f-7853-4f5b-a8d1-2125f875942d-1566236762"}

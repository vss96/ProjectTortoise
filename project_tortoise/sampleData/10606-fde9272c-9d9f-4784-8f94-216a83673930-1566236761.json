That means the compiler is not making life easier.\r\n\r\nDon't like X feature in Java/C++? Don't use it. One guy I worked with removed all the threading logic from a Windows C program. Another guy reimplemented object based programming by convention on a old K&amp;R C compiler (old box). You can also use peek and poke in Basic if you really want old man. And you will be an old man when you get done. YMMV.\r\n\r\nI too spent many a late night (early morning) optimizing the snot out of some assembly code I saw in Abrash's Black Book. I should have spent that time learning more MATH. Or Lisp. Or Forth. Or just coding algorithms period. Donald Knuth was right. Premature optimization is deadly.\r\n\r\nYou know, looking for the programming language to save your soul is plain wrong. You get more mileage out of learning general principles by reading theory books of all sorts. They can do what no language text can do: explain a concept and let you do the homework of writing the code. The best a language text can teach is a nugget or two. Nice, but you have to go through alot of books to get and recognize the nuggets.","created_utc":1165374924,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"ctsak","parent_id":"t3_trbc","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","retrieved_on":1473807861,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10606-fde9272c-9d9f-4784-8f94-216a83673930-1566236761"}

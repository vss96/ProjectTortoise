In this case you have to take \"printer's marks\" as one entity (similar to the phrase \"lion's mane\").  Don't let the plural on \"marks\" confuse you into thinking that \"printer\" is also necessarily plural because, though a lion can only have one mane, a printer has many marks.\r\n\r\nOne way of seeing it is rewriting the phrase without the apostrophe.  \"Lion's mane\" becomes \"mane of a lion\" and the sentence:  \"The lion's mane is characterized by...\" becomes \"The mane of a lion in characterized by...\", whereas \"Lions' manes are characterized by...\" becomes \"The manes of lions are characterized by...\".\r\n\r\nWhile I, personally, feel both forms can be technically correct, there are two things at work here:  1) the second (\"lions' manes\") sounds more awkward than the first (\"lion's mane\") in both forms while accomplishing the same task (making a broad statement about all manes of all lions) and 2) because they both accomplish the same sort of generalization (i.e. whatever follows the \"characterized by\" is applicable to all manes of all lions) it is unnecessary and frivolous to require the plural \"lions'\" when the singular \"lion's\" will do (you are not adding any information or meaning through the pluralization) and brevity (even if only conceptual) is always preferred.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_ti1d","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165250927,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6855-fcf7a9ae-deea-4139-819e-75442547c7c6-1566236760"}

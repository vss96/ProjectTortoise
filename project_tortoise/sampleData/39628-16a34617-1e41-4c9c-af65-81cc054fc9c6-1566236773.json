Then the stationary billiard ball begins to move off. Kinetic energy is said to transfer from one ball to the other. However, why does the energy transfer? And what is the mechanism? If you stand back from the physics, it appears, at present, that the kinetic energy transfers from one ball to the other rather like a \"ghostly spirit.\" Other than just citing the law of conservation of energy can we explain this mechanism more deeply?\r\n\r\nElectric fields, dude.  Definitely not metaphysics.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808971,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_veo0","edited":false,"id":"cvfca","author":"assortedslog","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39628-16a34617-1e41-4c9c-af65-81cc054fc9c6-1566236773"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; And again I will repeat this, didn't your mother ever teach you about manners?\r\n\r\nYes she did, whatever business of yours that might be. Manners are just that, manners. She also taught me that law and rights are more important.\r\n\r\n&gt; How rude of a person are you?\r\n\r\nOn a scale from 1-10, probably between 3 and 4. You?\r\n\r\n&gt; It is very relevant\r\n\r\nNo. Because ones rights is something noone else can impose on. By their very definition. Hence, freedom of expression mean exactly that. \"Manners\" and complying with someones request because they disagree or is offended is a courtesy.\r\n\r\nYou see, there's a difference between what you have the right to, and your opinon. You might not like that gay couples are allowed to kiss in public just like straight folks, but it **is** their right. And it is not within your rights to enforce they comply with your wishes based on your preference.\r\n\r\nThat is what I meant with irrelevance. Clearer now? And no, I don't consider that a \"limited view\" on the subject. I consider it knowing, treasuring and standing up for the human rights that make this country great.","link_id":"t3_t6wc","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165135257,"ups":2,"score":2,"author":"dln","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctfgt","parent_id":"t1_ctd98","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807621,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4675-2738aa4d-aa5d-404f-84a4-2f8eb07dea37-1566236759"}

I agree with that, in general, but not in the specific case of how Libertarian principles would apply to prevent the perceived give-away of taxpayer money to a huge corporation that can afford to pay $400K bonuses out to retired execs. \r\n\r\nIn my limited understanding of Libertarianism, they want to immediately auction off all publicly held land/resources to private entities. That would mean less oversight, no royalties, and incredibly poor environmental protection.

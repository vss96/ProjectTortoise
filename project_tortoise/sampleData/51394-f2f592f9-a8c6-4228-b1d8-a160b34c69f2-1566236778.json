(Middle-aged) Europeans dislike change as much as Americans but I think European banks just don't care about their customers' preferences as much as they do in the US. They just introduced Internet/ phone banking and stopped accepting checks a few years ago -- no matter if customers liked it or not (younger ones like me of course do prefer it). They did so because it saves them a lot of money. I think they downsized about half of their clerks because mostly everything is done via internet banking or ATM (which can also be used for EFT) now.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w14h","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167154663,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51394-f2f592f9-a8c6-4228-b1d8-a160b34c69f2-1566236778"}

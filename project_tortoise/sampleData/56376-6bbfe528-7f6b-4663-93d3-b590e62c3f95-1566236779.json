The exposed geologic strata - layer upon layer from the basement Vishnu schist to the capping Kaibab limestone - rise over a mile above the river, representing one of the most complete records of geological history that can be seen anywhere in the world. Geologic formations such as gneiss and schist found at the bottom of the Canyon date back **1,800 million years.** This geologic incline creates a diversity of biotic communities, and five of the seven life zones are present in the park.\r\n\r\n[National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/naturalfeaturesandecosystems.htm)\r\n","created_utc":1167374617,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":15,"ups":15,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56376-6bbfe528-7f6b-4663-93d3-b590e62c3f95-1566236779"}

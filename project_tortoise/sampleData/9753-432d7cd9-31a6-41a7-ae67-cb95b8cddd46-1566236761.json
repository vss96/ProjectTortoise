I doubt it.  The world would be better off with clearer rules on their use and with no abuse of them, but overall, we as a society have benefitted from their presence.\r\n\r\nThis weapon will have similar benefits and caveats.","link_id":"t3_tocn","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807831,"distinguished":null,"author":"neuquino","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctqcm","edited":false,"id":"ctqpj","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9753-432d7cd9-31a6-41a7-ae67-cb95b8cddd46-1566236761"}

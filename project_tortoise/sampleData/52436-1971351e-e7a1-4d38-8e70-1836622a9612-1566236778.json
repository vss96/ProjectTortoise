This isn't like a prostitution bust where they send a hot undercover cop upto a car and sollict you. There's a deer on the side of the road, only an asshole redneck would shoot it if he didn't have the rights to. This isn't like it's hunting season and they are setting these things up in places just to catch them then going \"gotcha!\" they put them along the road in places where they are not supposed to poach, or on private property, or even wildlife reserves that have problems with illegal poaching. These are a wonderful tool, all the police have to worry about now are the hunters turning the loaded weapons onto the cops once they've been caught red handed and already have two strikes against them in a three strike state.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809451,"gilded":0,"id":"cw4fv","parent_id":"t1_cw3un","edited":false,"author":"thatrez","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52436-1971351e-e7a1-4d38-8e70-1836622a9612-1566236778"}

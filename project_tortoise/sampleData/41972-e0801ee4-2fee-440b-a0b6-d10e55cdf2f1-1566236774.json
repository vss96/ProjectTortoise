Even before Windows 95, the then-current version of Office came out and changed everything from the then-standard Win 3.1 look and feel.  Win95 came out and gave everyone a new look, but it was still different than Office.\r\n\r\nLook at Office 2003.  It's got a completely different toolbar/menu look than anything that uses the standard toolkit.  It's got an app that's SDI, a few that are MDI that try to look sort of MDI but don't quite act that way, and some apps that are just completely different.\r\n\r\nWindows Media Player is the same way.  Each one has had a completely different (and just as completely unusable) interface.  \r\n\r\nThis is complete non-news.  You've never been able to look just like Office.  And certainly the OS never really helped.  MS views switching the UI each office release as a competitive differentiator.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809060,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vgvk","id":"cvjwf","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41972-e0801ee4-2fee-440b-a0b6-d10e55cdf2f1-1566236774"}

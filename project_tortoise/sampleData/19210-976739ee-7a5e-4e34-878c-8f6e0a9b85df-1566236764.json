{"controversiality":0,"body":"You can make up all the crap you want, but as a former lifelong Mormon, I know exactly and *precisely* what I am talking about.  You claimed that in the Mormon church \"sex is the worst sin next to murder\".  That is *unquestionably* *false*.  \r\n\r\nNot only false, but triply so: sex isn't a sin; murder isn't the worst sin (unless you'd prefer to call denial of the Holy Ghost a \"transgression\" -- it's still worst of all); and sex isn't after murder.  It's adultery in a temple marriage.\r\n\r\nYou are a crank and a fool who thinks he can assemble random misinterpreted quotes and claim doctrinal understanding.  I don't know what Mormon bug crawled up your butt, but you need to get over it.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u69m","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1165706209,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"feijai","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu9xm","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu9jq","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808191,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19210-976739ee-7a5e-4e34-878c-8f6e0a9b85df-1566236764"}

The only thing that has busted in this vehicle was an expensive ($500) window rollerupper-thingy in the guts of the door. The window wouldn't go back up because this regulator (is that it?) busted.\r\n\r\nI can tell the fuel pump needs a replacement, but god I've got 94K miles on it so I'm sure it's due.\r\n\r\nAnd there have been a couple days I swear I've almost outright killed the vehicle and it keeps humming along.\r\n\r\nOh, and my engine light came on at about 85K miles on it and I haven't taken the time to check it out because the engine sounds okay, the oil is fine, and no other lights are coming on. I plan to take it in soon for a checkup, but it's probably just a timing belt adjustment or one of those things that gets the dealers money they don't deserve so that they can reset the light and make up a cockamamie excuse.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I don't like about the Jeep Cherokee is that I wish it had more of a Jeep look to it and had better than 21mpg.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165733932,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19788-6c7b697a-049b-46f9-b147-c670f77865ad-1566236764"}

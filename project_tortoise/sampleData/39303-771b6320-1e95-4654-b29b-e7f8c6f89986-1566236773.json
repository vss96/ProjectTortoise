Fairness has nothing to do with their inclusion. The only reason they are mentioned at all is because it has been a long term Republican project to do away with, destroy and undercut these programs.\r\n\r\nThe spending that is out of control is by vast majority on the military side of the house. And related to the way the administration and its republican allies in congress have gutted Congressional oversight while Team Bush/Cheney in office. You can also look at the whole homeland security boondoggle as a good place to start cleaning house on the domestic side.\r\n\r\nI will certainly count on the dems to investigate the executives and the actions of the last congress now that they are in the majority. It's their job. And they have mine and millions of other Americans support for this. In fact they have 80% of the countries support to start impeachment proceedings if they feel justified. They have about the same to declare an immediate withdrawal of all troops from Iraq.\r\n\r\nThe old canard that the parties are the same is just not true. Dems are no saints but at this point they haven't show the degree of willful fascist criminality the republicans have.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ve7i","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808959,"author":"smacfarl","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cverj","parent_id":"t1_cvenw","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39303-771b6320-1e95-4654-b29b-e7f8c6f89986-1566236773"}

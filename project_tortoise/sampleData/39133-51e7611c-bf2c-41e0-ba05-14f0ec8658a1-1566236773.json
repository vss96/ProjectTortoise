{"body":"IANAE, but reducing debt is the last thing you want to do.  Sell any bonds or CDs you might own, and maybe take out a mortgage (fixed rate) if you're really sure the dollar will collapse.\r\n\r\nTake any money you have in the bank and invest it.  You could buy gold/silver/oil, real estate, or a foreign stock index, but even if you invest in US stocks you will be OK if the dollar goes down, since the companies you own can still sell their product overseas.  It will still hurt, but not as bad as if you had all your money sitting in the bank waiting to be devalued.  Also, having your money in a stock index is a fine place to be if the dollar doesn't decline.\r\n\r\nAvoid companies with large cash holdings like Microsoft.  Otherwise, big, global companies are as good a bet as any.\r\n\r\nInvesting in real estate is actually not a bad move, since real estate protects you from inflation.  If the dollar drops in value your house will still be worth the value of a house.  Except that real estate is already really high right now...","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ve7i","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"created_utc":1166558730,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"jopejope","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvef8","parent_id":"t1_cve8k","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808953,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39133-51e7611c-bf2c-41e0-ba05-14f0ec8658a1-1566236773"}

It was even 1.6°C warmer than in 2005, which was previously the warmest autumn since 1706, when records were first kept.\r\n\r\nIt's the warmest weather in 300 years, not that much of a peak in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nNo one is denying that the earth is warming up, but there are just too many confounding variables to know how much of that is attributable to human cause. For virtually every argument on one side of the fence, there's an equally valid argument on the other. Bottom line one knows for sure why the Earth is warming up, and even further, what to do about it.\r\n\r\nThe Earth has been this hot before, and fairly recently. The Earth goes through major temperature variations in its past, and has survived these just fine.\r\n\r\nWithin a couple of decades, most of the first world will have weaned off fossil fuels, anyway. It's not clear that doing it faster would help much. At that point, it will be important to encourage the 2nd and 3rd world countries to use cleaner technology as they transition from agricultural to industrial to information economies.","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473809137,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cvncx","edited":false,"id":"cvnud","author":"NoFixedAbode","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43849-ba8d7410-2f2d-4fdb-a06b-c5f63ec5e3b0-1566236774"}

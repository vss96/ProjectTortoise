{"body":"This was in the news last year. It began with reports of sexual misconduct in the Congo. The right-wing hardliners jumped all over it, leading occasionally to responses from UN officials such as the following:\r\n\r\n&gt;Michelle Malkin's column (\"U.N.'s Rape of the Innocents,\" Opinion, Feb. 16) neglects to mention\r\nthe measures the United Nations is taking to confront the deeply disturbing issue of sexual\r\nexploitation and abuse by U.N. peacekeepers.\r\nOur policy is clear: zero tolerance.\r\nAll forms of sexual exploitation and abuse are prohibited. To enforce this, our policies are being\r\nre-examined, and we are focusing on broad and tangible reforms in enforcement, training, staff\r\nwelfare and victim assistance and support. \r\n(from http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/ctte/JHL2.pdf)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was more bad news:\r\n\r\n&gt;Sunday, March 13, 2005; Page A22\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations is facing new allegations of sexual misconduct by U.N. personnel in Burundi, Haiti, Liberia and elsewhere, which is complicating the organization's efforts to contain a sexual abuse scandal that has tarnished its Nobel Prize-winning peacekeepers in Congo.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The allegations indicate that a series of measures the United Nations has taken in recent years have failed to eliminate a culture of sexual permissiveness that has plagued its far-flung peacekeeping operations over the last 12 years. But senior U.N. officials say they have signaled their seriousness by imposing new reforms and forcing senior U.N. military commanders and officials to step down if they do not curb such practices. \r\n\r\nUN Secretary-General Kofi Annan then prepared a [comprehensive report {warning:PDF}](http://unmil.org/documents/cdua60862.pdf) describing the problems and detailing the measures that the UN would be using to fight them:\r\n\r\n&gt;To address the problems of sexual exploitation and abuse cases in its field\r\nmissions, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has developed a\r\ncomprehensive strategy on sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations\r\npeacekeeping personnel, based primarily on the broad package of reforms endorsed\r\nby the General Assembly in 2005 in its resolution 59/300. \r\n&gt;The Departmentâ€™s strategy is a three-pronged approach, composed of measures\r\naimed at preventing misconduct, enforcing United Nations standards of conduct and\r\nundertaking remedial action. Significant progress has been made to date to\r\nimplement this strategy. For instance, considerable emphasis has been placed by the\r\nDepartment on communicating to the leadership of peacekeeping operations their\r\nresponsibilities in terms of addressing sexual exploitation and abuse. Legal\r\nagreements have been modified to ensure that all civilian peacekeeping personnel\r\nand experts on mission are bound by the standards of my bulletin on special\r\nmeasures for protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (ST/SGB/2003/13). In\r\naddition, a wide range of awareness-raising and training materials have been\r\ndeveloped on United Nations standards of conduct, including sexual exploitation and\r\nabuse, which have been disseminated to peacekeeping operations, Member States\r\nand the wider United Nations system. Furthermore, between 1 January 2004 and\r\nmid-May 2006, the United Nations completed investigations into allegations of\r\nsexual exploitation and abuse involving 307 peacekeeping personnel in all missions,\r\nresulting in 16 civilians being dismissed and 155 uniformed peacekeeping personnel\r\nbeing sent home. \r\n\r\nSo the UN *is* doing something about it, but this article doesn't really talk about it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, [124 UN Peacekeepers were killed last year, but their deaths didn't get much attention](http://reddit.com/info/71of/comments).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w2wl","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167181628,"author":"Kanniya","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_w2wl","edited":false,"id":"cw3sj","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809438,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52063-b3e43ef9-b8f4-40ad-8dbd-b36eaefe5be8-1566236778"}

It depends on the type of Black family for whom you are working.  I come from several generations of professional people.  As a result, I grew up with the luxury of thinking more \"alternatively.\" I wasn't trying to climb any social ladders or break through any barriers. We've also rejected the myth of prep schools, fancy houses and cars as symbols of our success.   We no longer believe that fitting in with the White middle class is more important than doing what our hearts say.\r\n\r\nAs a result, when looking for a minder, I find out what the going rate is and raise it by one or 2 pounds.  I do ask my minders to work harder and I'm prepared to pay for the service.  I want them to interact with my child, visit musuems, do art projects and stimulate learning.  I don't want them to sit at the park gossping with the other nannies or watching television.  This makes the job harder.  \r\n\r\nMany traditional middle class Black families want the same thing.  However, having been the recent beneficaries of the civil rights movement - they feel as if they have to conform to the values of the white middle class and out compete them in traditional venues - such as private schools.  Sadly, they've forgotten their roots and aren't prepared to pay for the services. \r\n\r\nMy daughter looked after three Black boys. She had to adhere to a strict schedule of \"character building\" activities like: piano practice, chess playing, homework enforcement, etc.  She made less working for this family than she did for other Black families who had similar backgrounds to our own. They trusted her to interact in a positive and loving way with their children.  And paid her handsomely for the service of her spontaniety, creativity and love.  \r\n\r\nMany nannies will make the assumption that you are a more traditional family.  I never have a problem finding competent, loving people to care for our child.  But - I advertise for \"companions\" and \"early educators,\" not nannies.  And there is the difference.  I see them as a team member.  Most others see them as simply a necessary possession towards achieving a goal.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w367","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52724-5c77c5d4-43cc-470c-be0f-8a67755cf68c-1566236778"}

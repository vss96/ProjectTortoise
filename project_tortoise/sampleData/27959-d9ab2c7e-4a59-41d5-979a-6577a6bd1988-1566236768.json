Cantonese (and Mandarin etc.) speakers don't require tonal processing any more than English speakers do: they just use it for a different purpose.  Denotation rather than connotation.  English speakers use a fairly complex set of tones to connote emotion, punctuation, and emphasis.  The Chinese cannot do this as they've already used them up to denote meaning.  So they resort to special punctuation words (particles), word-doubling to emphasize words, and in some cases, making a word loud to suggest emotion (just as we do sometimes).  It's nontrivial for the Chinese to learn English 'tones', just as it is the other way around.\r\n\r\nI am convinced of one thing though: tonal languages result in cultures consisting of people who can't sing.  The Cantonese and Mandarin friends of mine are just abysmal singers, in English and in Chinese.  I'm pretty sure there's a relationship there.\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_uqmi","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27959-d9ab2c7e-4a59-41d5-979a-6577a6bd1988-1566236768"}

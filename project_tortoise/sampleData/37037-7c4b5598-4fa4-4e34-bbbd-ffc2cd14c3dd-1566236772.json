But I don't think there is any other text the age of the New Testament that we can reproduce with as much confidence.  The degree to which Biblical texts have been preserved over the years is pretty remarkable, compared to everything else written that long ago.\r\n\r\nI don't think Christian scholars have been trying to trick anyone.  Everything Ehrman said has been publically available knowledge and widely known among even pious Christian academics.  It was just too dry for the general public to get excited about, or was presented in a glass 98 percent full context.  I think even the woman caught in adultery passage is tagged as \"only appears in later texts\" or somesuch in many Bible translations.\r\n\r\nSo, kudos to Ehrman for showing that the glasses of the innerant literalists are not 100% full.  But 98% full is still not the same as mostly empty.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_v6h2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166483101,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37037-7c4b5598-4fa4-4e34-bbbd-ffc2cd14c3dd-1566236772"}

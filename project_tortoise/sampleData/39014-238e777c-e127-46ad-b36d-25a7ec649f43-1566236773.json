Real median wages have been in decline since the 70s.  Government debt and liabilities have been shooting up, and personal debt has exploded since the mid 90s.  The trade deficit has grown enormous.\r\n\r\nSocially: The prison population has exploded.  Civic involvement is in decline (see bowling alone).  The government is growing ever more intrusive and powerful.  Education and literacy are getting worse.  Inequality is worsening.  The aesthetic quality of our cities and towns has degraded and sprawl is consuming the land.  Food quality as measured by vitamin, mineral, and synthetic additive content is worse.  Depression and neuroses are on the rise.\r\n\r\nThe US is declining by many meaningful measures of economic and social health.  The major trends started in the 70s.\r\n\r\nI think the fact that Las Vegas is the fastest growing city in America says a lot.  It's a socially empty eyesore dedicated to losing money in luxury.

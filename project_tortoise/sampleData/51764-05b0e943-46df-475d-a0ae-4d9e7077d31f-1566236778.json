It's classic \"old guy\" rant where you claim that things were different and you blame it on the godlessness of kids today. \r\n\r\nFrankly, I was kind of revolted when he agreed that the devastation of hurricane Katrina was caused by people being insufficiently religious. \r\n\r\n&gt;Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said, \"I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we've been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then this: \r\n&gt;Now we're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it doesn't bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.\r\n\r\nYeah. Right. Because you can't be moral without god. And no one ever did those things 'back in the day' when everyone was a practicing . . . religiousnessite. \r\n\r\nBut my favorite is this: \r\n&gt; Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school. The Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself. And we said OK.\r\n\r\nIt also says lots of other things. How 'bout we all just agree that stealing and killing is bad, and you should love your neighbour *without* reading the bible in school. Just a thought. Then we don't have to worry about all the parts of the bible that say things that most people wouldn't be caught dead agreeing with.\r\n\r\nI like Ben Stein. I find he often argues quite rationally and honestly. I don't see that here. \r\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167170270,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvydd","id":"cw3bx","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ator_fighting_eagle","retrieved_on":1473809429,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51764-05b0e943-46df-475d-a0ae-4d9e7077d31f-1566236778"}

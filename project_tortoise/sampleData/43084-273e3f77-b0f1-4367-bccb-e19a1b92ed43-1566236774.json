I was just wondering same thing. I'm amazed. You actually need new syntax for this?\r\n\r\nNeed? No (even though Python doesn't have CL's method combinaitons), it's just syntactic sugar to make something preexisting idioms easier to use, which is fairly common in Python. The new `with` statement of Python 2.5 is exactly the same, syntactic sugar for try/finally.\r\n\r\n&gt; If this is not decoration then what is?\r\n\r\nIt is decoration, but that's not really relevant to the discussion as CL isn't Python and there was no syntactic sugar for method combination in Python before decorators (apart from metaclasses, but that's a bit overblown and can't be used on functions)","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vie8","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166707359,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43084-273e3f77-b0f1-4367-bccb-e19a1b92ed43-1566236774"}

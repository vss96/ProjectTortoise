There really is a deep conflict in the deaf community about this implant..as much as there would be (although on a smaller scale) if dark skinned people could have a surgury to make them white, or vice-versa.\r\nThere is also a shrinking population of students attending deaf schools, due to mainstreaming and special education law changes in the last several years.

Simply stated, there's currently no way to account for the observations we're making right now without considering the influence of manmade greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nWhat amazes me in these discussions (and this isn't necessarily directed at the parent post) is the sheer number of people that think they're smarter than the scientists who study these things, that none of those scientists ever thought to look at the natural ice age cycle or other variables. Do they honestly think that scientists haven't considered the Earth's natural cycles, or that there might be more variables at play? And what kills me is that this sudden skepticism generally comes from the same people who accept every word that comes from Rush Limbaugh, Karl Rove, James Dobson, etc without question.\r\n\r\nTruthiness indeed.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vm6j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166719913,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":10,"ups":10,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43486-eb5a674e-e4da-44a6-ba3a-26f16acb2fc7-1566236774"}

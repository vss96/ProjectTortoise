So, even with machinery to tighten something, it would require a massive tightening to create even a minor containment incident. If you took the two pieces, put them together with no foam between them, and struck them with a hammer on both ends, you might create a containment mess, nothing more. And even at that, we're not talking Chernobyl containment. We're talking a factory and perhaps the adjacent buildings near it. And for that, it could be fixed in a matter of under an hour.\r\n\r\nI would reason to bet this thing was taken way out of context and proportion and is merely an overworked worker trying to raise the awareness of conditions in the plant. Sure, he's got a raw deal, but he's trying to resolve it the wrong way.","controversiality":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166312429,"ups":4,"score":4,"subreddit":"science","id":"cv2av","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v1wz","author_flair_text":null,"author":"supermike","retrieved_on":1473808724,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32992-12bf1631-369e-4938-ad97-f282a7962626-1566236770"}

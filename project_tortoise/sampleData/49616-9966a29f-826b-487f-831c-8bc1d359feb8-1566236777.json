If anything the hoax isn't be so much what happens in the video, as much as it is the reddit title (not the one on the site) which claims that this is a \"high-powered\" pistol.  All it does is knock over a soda can from a few feet away.  Even a plastic BB gun could do that, so I don't see it as unlikely that a coilgun could.  \r\n\r\nFrom what I've heard, it isn't even unusual for hobbiests to make coilguns.  It might be slightly more impressive if it was a railgun instead of a coilgun, but only because I've never heard of anyone making a small scale one of those.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vyrf","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49616-9966a29f-826b-487f-831c-8bc1d359feb8-1566236777"}

No matter what flavor you like a scoop of Google, two scoops of YouTube, or even Vimeo, MSN Video, AOL, and so many other sites I can't name them all here. You name it, scoopvid it will find it. You can search videos by tag, by channel, and by category. The site is in beta (technically), but loads fast, searches quickly, and has a bunch of great pre-made views listed at the top of the page. I don't know that I will need to go visit YouTube or Google every time I am looking for a video clip. This site will find a ton of video really fast.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_rmky","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165040734,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2910-2d062e8c-1e68-4be3-8fd2-7ede906da7b9-1566236759"}

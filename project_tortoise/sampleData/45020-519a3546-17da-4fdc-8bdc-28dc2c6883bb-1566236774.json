Bush shows signs of that, Mormons are more than happy to believe in a book absolutely disproved by genetics, but my impression of Obama's religiosity is that it is rather sensible. Could be wrong, though. If you have a good source on him putting faith above facts, I'd be interested to see it.","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45020-519a3546-17da-4fdc-8bdc-28dc2c6883bb-1566236774"}

If this were so nobody would bother with dynamic typing, and we'd use static type inference instead.\r\n\r\nThese so-called \"dynamic\" languages (what a bad term) have a lot to offer which the combination of Java+IDEA does not:\r\n\r\n- Functional programming\r\n\r\n- Interactive development (testing snippets in a REPL, replacing definitions while a program runs)\r\n\r\n- Loading code at runtime (using source code for configuration and plugins, no ClassLoader JAR hell or XML)\r\n\r\n- Inspecting objects in a running image\r\n\r\n- Metaprogramming\r\n\r\n- Printing objects in a parseable form\r\n\r\nThere is of course much more. IDEA might have some nice keyboard shortcuts, but please don't pretend it makes Java into an expressive language. At best, it smooths over some of the serious shortcomings (the lack of closures doesn't hurt quite as much if you can generate anon inner class boilerplate with a few keys).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_tdu8","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807615,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t3_tdu8","id":"ctf59","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4536-87dec447-76ea-4fb8-b7fe-6e04c8c2f0e3-1566236759"}

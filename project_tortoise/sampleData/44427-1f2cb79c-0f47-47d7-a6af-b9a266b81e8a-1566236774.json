I get flyers in my mail/on my door all the time for random charities (that I've never heard of) that are collecting items for \"the needy\" or \"veterans\" or whomever. It's my job to research them before giving my stuff to them; otherwise, I'm the only person to blame, really. \r\n\r\nCharity via item donation shouldn't be considered any less worthy of research than charity via monetary donation. Take the time to find out where your donations are going and you'll (hopefully) never feel scammed.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vo79","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166740323,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44427-1f2cb79c-0f47-47d7-a6af-b9a266b81e8a-1566236774"}

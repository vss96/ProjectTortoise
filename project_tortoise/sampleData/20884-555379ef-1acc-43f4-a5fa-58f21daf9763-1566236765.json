{"controversiality":0,"body":"\"There is little or no social stigma on being a Christian\" -- You dream! This is just not so. Many Christians are afraid to even admit it at their place of business, at their job, kids at school are afraid to say it to their friends. Now granted, the same in large part goes for atheists as well --- but to think there is no social stigma on *ANY* world view is just incorrect.\r\n\r\nProof? See Reddit! :) \r\n\r\n\"It is fairly common for atheists to either state or imply that religious people are on average less intelligent than atheist\" --- Yes this is a large part of what I mean. It is also disgusting and insulting, and wrong. \r\n\r\nMore often than not whenever a Christian enters an atheist forum and just *mentions* They are a Christian, they get blasted for being an idiot, stupid, etc. \r\n\r\nOverall I am amazed at the hypocricy of the atheists I have run into. \"We must advance free speech for all worldviews. Crush religion!\" \"It is wrong to hate a group of people and to be prejudice! All Christians are idiots\" etc --- its just full of double standards.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ua04","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165788795,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"CarlH","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cucy6","id":"cud3b","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808249,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20884-555379ef-1acc-43f4-a5fa-58f21daf9763-1566236765"}

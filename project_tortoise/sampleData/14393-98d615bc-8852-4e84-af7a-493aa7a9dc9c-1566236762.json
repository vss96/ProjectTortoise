Change of state is taboo in functional programming. But given any value of n, the return value is always the same, so the function is referential transparent. i.e. digg(5) - digg(5) is always zero. Then, what's that about not being able to assign values or change state in FP?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u0s0","subreddit":"programming","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1165520488,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14393-98d615bc-8852-4e84-af7a-493aa7a9dc9c-1566236762"}

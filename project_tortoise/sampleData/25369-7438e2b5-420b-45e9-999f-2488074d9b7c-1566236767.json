Again, in .NET, you wouldn't have to write that line of code (or that method for that matter, or the code to invoke that method, or a \"management agent\" that calls the method to register the method for processing).  That's a huge advantage when you have to deal with something past \"hello world\" examples.  As for automating it, I have seen everything from writing class names in XML files (ie XFire) to searching the entire classpath (ie Stripes without filtering) for annotated classes, so I have no doubt you could come up with your own non-optimized and non-standard way of automating registration.  Personally, I would prefer it was a part of the language like .NET.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ujwh","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808415,"author":"sbrown123","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cului","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_culpo","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25369-7438e2b5-420b-45e9-999f-2488074d9b7c-1566236767"}

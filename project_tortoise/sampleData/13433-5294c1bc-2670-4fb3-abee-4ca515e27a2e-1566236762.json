That's the great thing about german games, the designer is held accountable as an artist for his work. Second, I go by their reputation among fellow german-gamers, and by the reputation of the publisher.\r\n\r\nThis article neglects to mention that Thurn &amp; Taxis is made by  Andreas Seyfarth, double Spiel des Jahres winner, and author of the awesome Puerto Rico. So it neglects the most important things, IMO. But I give it points for at least not just listing the glitzy \"marketing department games\", such as these reviews often do.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tw0z","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165481597,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13433-5294c1bc-2670-4fb3-abee-4ca515e27a2e-1566236762"}

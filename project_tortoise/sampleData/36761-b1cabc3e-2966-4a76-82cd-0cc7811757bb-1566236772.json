{"controversiality":0,"body":"Norwegian speaking:\r\n\r\nCertain officials would burn if what you can buy in the kiosks was the only porn you could get over here. As the link in parent implies, all over-the-counter erotica in Norway comes with the active genitalia demurely covered or pixelated. The same goes for the bunny channels on the cable networks, except here the _entire_ image is covered by a black sheet sporting the capital letters \"CENSORED ACCORDING TO NORWEGIAN LAW\". I have a hard time understanding how anyone can get off to material like this. But they do, as the selection of porn at my local store testifies. I myself am glad that I can get a proper selection on the net, but it is a shame that our society hasn't come farther on this issue. There is always something to pick on, I suppose...\r\n\r\nThe Schau sex-on-the-stage incident was hilarious, though. Presented like this it looks wonderful. Did they actually end up having to pay the fines? I am not the most informed in the matter, and Norwegian Google doesn't return any obvious results. It would be another testament to our prudishness if they did, and it would hardly be the first time someone got punished for expressing something a little outside the box.","link_id":"t3_v5m3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166475966,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"marvin","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv9pc","parent_id":"t1_cv9ej","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808862,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36761-b1cabc3e-2966-4a76-82cd-0cc7811757bb-1566236772"}

{"body":"I think it's because you can go right at red lights at most intersections (unless otherwise posted) as opposed to left turns you have to wait for the green light. \r\n\r\nObscure fact I learned in driving school: in most jurisdictions it's also legal go *left* at a red light as long as the left turn is from a one-way street onto another one-way street. Even though the \"one-way left on red\" is legal in most places some cops will still ticket you anyway because they're not aware of the rule.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vn5e","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166741368,"author":"wearedevo","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvowi","parent_id":"t1_cvoav","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809156,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44461-2822bb3e-10be-45cd-9dab-0529e6bc7053-1566236774"}

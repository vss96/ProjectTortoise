I've been reluctant to go with CAPTCHAs because they're annoying for visitor who can see, discriminatory toward visitors with poor or no vision, and still don't seem to stop all the spam.\r\n\r\nInstead, I implemented a \"human test\" that asks very simple arithmetic questions all in words (e.g. \"What do you get if you add three and five?\") and offers a dropdown for the answer. It also randomly cycles through several different questions with different answers.\r\n\r\nI found it dramatically reduced comment spam but did not eliminate it completely. The spam bots use brute force and pick random answers so the odd post actually gets the right answer.\r\n\r\nI also tried changing the field names from \"username\" and \"comment\" to nonsense words. Again, that seemed to stall them, but about a week later, the attacks stepped up again.\r\n\r\nI feel sort of like Lieutenant Worf trying to fight off the Borg: *Captain, they have adapted!*","link_id":"t3_t7a9","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164992501,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1471-56b15ea9-9ff7-425d-9eb5-1ea37d4dd4c3-1566236758"}

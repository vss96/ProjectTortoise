Only once do I remember that happening in my class - in math.  We had 4 or 5 kids doing algebra, and then three or four doing more advanced algebra, and then I think one was even doing trig - this was 8th grade.  It took a lot of resources for them to do that, though.  They had two teachers for that class - and it couldn't have been more than 10 students.  Luckily, most of the time the material doesn't have to be that different to tailor the course to each student's needs and abilities.\r\n\r\nIt's been a dream of mine for years now to start a school like that... problem is I can't teach for shit.  But I do know what to look for, so maybe I'll do it, hire teachers - someday...","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31589-b6db8799-be96-41a9-9e59-729262751c5d-1566236770"}

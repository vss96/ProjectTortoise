The chemical and physical properties of CO2 are well understood.  \r\n\r\nTo deny that CO2 increases global warming and that there is simply \"a correlation\" makes about as much sense as to claim that putting on extra clothing is simply correlated with feeling warmer \"but needs more study\".  CO2 IS a greenhouse gas - there is no doubt.  Pumping huge quanitities into the atmosphere will have a greenhouse effect.  The only question is how much.\r\n\r\nClimate scientists aren't basing their predictions on computer science, but on much-used and well-respected simulation modelling techniques that have shown to work well in other fields (chemistry, biology and physics).\r\n","ups":8,"score":8,"created_utc":1166720981,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43556-5188f6fd-fc43-4e84-a88c-302108491891-1566236774"}

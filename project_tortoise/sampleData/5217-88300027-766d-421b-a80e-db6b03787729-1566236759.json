{"controversiality":1,"body":"Notability should *not* factor into it. It's an encyclopedia, it's supposed to mark a record of things that are important and things that are original *not* pop culture, there are a billion magazines to do that.\r\n\r\nI've seen plenty of useful information go because some jackass on wikipedia thought it was not notable. It's repeatedly happens, and it's happening more often. Wikipedia isn't far from perfect, it's circling the drain. I've gone from using wikipedia to using its sources, they're the only things with credible information anymore. Some articles are still useful, but compared to what it was a year ago a lot of the ones I've used have severley degraded.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about everyone else on here, but I believe the 30 or more pages dedicated to the Stargate series would be better served being left to the shows fansites. It's all good information, it's just not relevant to an encyclopedia for one TV series to have more information on them than entire countries.","link_id":"t3_tfak","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165171916,"score":0,"ups":0,"author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctgu2","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctg9e","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807646,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5217-88300027-766d-421b-a80e-db6b03787729-1566236759"}

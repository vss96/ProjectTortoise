It was like he has a British passport, he's white and everything else fits for normal person, someone pulled out the wrong guy.\r\n\r\nI thankfully got let through, possibly because her coworkers were freaking on her. Her male coworker, who she was talking to and barely in earshot said 'he doesnt fit, he's British'. It wasn't a friendly piece of advice the way he was saying it, it was more if you try to pin something you'll get your ass fired.\r\n\r\nEventually when I got through I'd had nothing explained to me, and some bull cover told to the people who were picking me up. I haven't done anything about it, the woman was just doing her job and the person before her had screwed up by letting an Iranian guy who'd been pulled over by three different people through but pulled out a British guy no one had had a problem with.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807510,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ct91v","id":"ct9nv","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1910-28f66c82-c744-45ae-af07-2242935d1fcf-1566236758"}

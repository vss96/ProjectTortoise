But I don't think Microsoft's corporate culture is the sort which would let it be done properly; in the open-source world, systems like `apt` work because they distribute the burden of testing and maintenance over a large community, but I can't see Microsoft cozying up to an idea like that -- they'd most likely implement it as some sort of \"Microsoft Authorized Application Partner\" program, and end up adding too much bureaucracy or other barriers to participation for it to really get off the ground. I _can_ see this, however, as an area for PC OEMs to help their profit margins a bit; offering an installer mechanism on every PC sold, with subscription access to a network of repositories, would be doable for Dell or another big OEM and would probably be profitable for them.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wifs","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60081-1e5a6661-8371-4639-9373-e429b16970fa-1566236780"}

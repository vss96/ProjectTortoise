{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wdrb","stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; Kids have always horsed around to learn about sex. That's natural. Dressing like whores at that age isn't.\r\n\r\nActually, it's \"natural\" to go *au naturel*.  Or perhaps wear a loincloth.  Clothes just seem natural to you because they happened to be in style when you were born.\r\n\r\nArguments abouh what's natural or not completely miss the point, though.  Acceptable clothing is just one part of a culture; like all cultural artifacts, it will always have an element of \"because we say so\" in it.  Not saying that's bad, or attaching any value judgment to it.  But if you really want to look at the origins, go *all* the way back. ;-)\r\n\r\nAs for why they've surfaced so much in the past decade: I suspect a strong stock market.  There was a similar effect in the 1920s, with flapper's skirts getting noticeably shorter.  Dress then became much more modest during the Depression.  One well-known finance correlation is the [hemline rule](http://www.crossingwallstreet.com/archives/2006/04/the_hemline_the.html): supposedly, the stock market does better when women show more skin.\r\n\r\nI suspect this is a subconscious evolutionary psychology at work.  When times are good, our biological imperative is to go out and mate, as we can support more offspring.  When times are bad, women (and men) concentrate more on surviving than on attracting a mate.","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167448578,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cwf55","edited":false,"id":"cwf9a","author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809656,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58072-891a282c-4a91-4acc-aba9-d2527bf07154-1566236780"}

It blends, it juices and it grinds and costs less than any one of the said devices. Takes up less space than them too. Mine gets used mainly for coffee beans.\r\n\r\n&gt; Fuel-Efficient Scooter - ride a bike\r\n\r\nFine for up to 10 miles. Beyond that it starts to take too long to get where you want to go.\r\n\r\n&gt; A Hybrid Car - haha. buy an older compact car. Hybrid cars are hardly ever worth it.\r\n\r\nGet a Diesel. Run it on cooking oil.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ve60","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809014,"author":"css1971","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvhl0","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cveyp","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40755-3f6505a3-333f-47c0-92f9-d544b9899e45-1566236773"}

Not \"because it is their job\" (he never wrote \"because\", by the way). It is just ethical. You are not a politician. You are not even a journalist.  You never stated that you are an independent and objective source of consumer products' reviews. Sending you gift for review is definitely an attempt to affect you in their favor but there is nothing unethical in this attempt. This is essence of any business - to make people, considered important, to be in favor to the business.  Unless those people are supposed to be NOT in favor to any business – it is ethical. I hope you don’t consider bloggers as jurors in murder case. (By the way, would you had much more of “social obligations” if Bill Gates personally called you and asked for a review without any gifts? Would it be unethical too?)","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1167375573,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"joel","edited":false,"id":"cwc2v","parent_id":"t3_waf5","author":"wrotit","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473809596,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56389-51f1af59-d19e-4673-8ae1-cea89740fd81-1566236779"}

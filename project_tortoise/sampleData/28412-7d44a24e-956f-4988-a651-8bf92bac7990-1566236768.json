You say that most CS grads don't need a heavy math background, but what you really mean is most programmers don't need a heavy math background.\r\n\r\nComputer Science is not programming. It is actually a branch of mathematics, hence all of the required math classes.\r\n\r\nThis becomes clear once you get to the higher level CS courses. Things like Automata Theory, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Combinatorics, and too many others to get into are purely math.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_urzo","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808538,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"procrastitron","parent_id":"t1_cus8b","id":"cusho","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28412-7d44a24e-956f-4988-a651-8bf92bac7990-1566236768"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt;First of all, why are switch statements bad? According to this article, they can become long and complicated. \r\n\r\nWhat doesn't become long and complicated if used improperly?\r\n\r\n&gt; According to another source they may spawn duplication of code.\r\n\r\nAnd scattering all of your code among various sub classes won't result in duplication?\r\n\r\nWhat if you need to do a switch on multiple properties? Do you create MxNxO classes?\r\n\r\nWhat if a property value changes do to the switch? Do you write a bunch of code to create a new object of the correct type, copying all of the original object's fields?\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with switch statments when used correctly. There is, however, something wrong with needlessly complicating your code base just so that you can say \"I'm cool, I didn't use any switch statements\".\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that switch statements are always the way to go either, there are times when subclassing is the right thing to do, but unsubstantiated theories such as this inevitably lead the poorly designed code.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_u5oc","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165622498,"author":"grauenwolf","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu6nw","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u5oc","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808130,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17393-45395196-003d-4e20-bfd5-7badb1c056a3-1566236763"}

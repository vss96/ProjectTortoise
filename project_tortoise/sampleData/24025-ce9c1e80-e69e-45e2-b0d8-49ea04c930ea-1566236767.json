And don't tell me your Lisp code is readable without Enters. It's not mandatory, but if you ever plan to revisit it again it's totally impractical to write a sufficiently complex Lisp code in one line (anyone who does that deserves to be brutally murdered). So to speak as if number of keystrokes *matters*, I'd say it's a draw: Python coders need backspace to unindent; Lispers need open-parens to indent.\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of S-Exp, and its benefits far outweigh its needs for (some say superfluous) parenthesis's, but by far I believe Python probably has the most minimalistic block structure possible (save the colons, I don't think they're actually needed, but again my real-world experience with Python is limited).\r\n\r\nAnd Lisp doesn't have those cut/paste/etc. you mentioned. Emacs does. Why are you even bringing that up? Do you think Python can't be coded in Emacs? Personally I code in Vim, and doing everything you mentioned is infinitely trivial. (ddp swaps lines, xp transposes chars.)\r\n\r\nOh, and Python isn't as interactive as Lisp, so it doesn't need to execute (C-c), though it has a REPL.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uhgd","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165896696,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24025-ce9c1e80-e69e-45e2-b0d8-49ea04c930ea-1566236767"}

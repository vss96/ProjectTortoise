Usually, it's something like \"because code is data, Lisp has macros, etc.\" or \"I can't explain it, you have to learn Lisp and find out\".  \r\n\r\nI've spent a little time learning Lisp so far, and have a general idea of how the language works, but I can't see why it's so great.  If I write functional code in it, it always turns out to be more concise in Haskell or OCaml, and other times, it's just plain old procedural C-style code.  \r\n\r\nI've seen many Redditors praise Lisp, so I figured you could explain it:  what makes Lisp so great?  And instead of just saying \"code is data, macros, code is data\", could you explain what those things mean, and why they are so useful in programming?  If it's such a long explanation that it can't be done justice here, can you point me to somewhere that does explain it?","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w6m0","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809494,"author":"Jimmy","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw6m1","parent_id":"t3_w6m0","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53633-743b1a54-3191-4e4b-94c6-9d8e7ec48182-1566236778"}

Isoflavones (isoflavonoids) are one of two primary groups of phytoestrogens, plant-based estrogen mimicking organic chemicals with antioxidant--free radical scavengers--properties.The other group is lignan. Plant lignans associated with high fiber foods such as cereal brans and beans are the principal precursor to mammalian lignans which have an ability to bind to human estrogen sites. The best source of lignans is flax seed. Soybeans are a significant source of mammalian lignan precursor secoisolariciresinol containing 13-273 Âµg/100 g dry weight.[20] Another phytoestrogen, in the human diet, with estrogen activity is coumestans but much less well studied which are found in beans, split-peas, with the best sources being alfalfa, clover, and soybean sprouts. Coumesterol, an isoflavone coumarin derivative is the only coumestan in foods.[21][22]\r\n\r\n[edit] Phytoestrogen in men\r\n\r\nBecause of the phytoestrogen content, some studies indicate that there is a correlation between a soybean-rich diet and a decrease in the level of testosterone in men, although these findings are controversial.[23][24][25]\r\n\r\nA study carried out at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast linked soy to male infertility, including damage of reproductive capability already caused during childhood.[26] The study also points out that \"soy is not just consumed by vegetarians, it is contained in a lot of everyday processed foods.\"\r\n\r\n[edit] Phytoestrogen in women\r\n\r\nA 2001 study determined that women with current or past breast cancer should be aware of the risks of potential tumor growth when taking soy products.[27]\r\n\r\nA 2006 study reviewed the relationship with soy and breast cancer. To summarize, the research recommendation is that the impact of isoflavones on breast tissue needs to be evaluated at the cellular level in women at high risk for breast cancer.[28]\r\n\r\n[edit] Phytoestrogen in infant formula\r\n\r\nThere are some studies that state that a phytoestrogen in soy can lead to alterations in the proliferation and migration of intestinal cells. The effects of these alterations are unknown.[29][30] However, some studies conclude there are no adverse effects in human growth, development, or reproduction as a result of the consumption of soy-based infant formula.[31] Other studies conclude that more research is needed to answer the question of what effect phytoestrogens have on infants.[32][33]\r\n\r\n[edit] Allergens\r\n\r\n    Further information: Soy allergy\r\n\r\nWith the increased use of soybean in western diet comes also a danger of food allergies. About 8% of children in the USA are allergic to soybean proteins. The major soy allergen has been identified by scientists at USDA. Both transgenic and conventional soybean varieties without the allergenic protein have been prepared, and hopefully will soon reach the market. This will be particularly important for preparation of baby formulas, since dual allergy to both milk and soy proteins is not uncommon. Soya allergy, typically, will manifest itself approximately a day after consumption of the beans. Common symptoms are urticaria, rash, itching, and redness of the skin.[34][35][36][37][38][39][40]\r\n\r\n[edit] Thyroid effects\r\n\r\nEating as little as 35 grams of soy such as tofu per day (just 10 grams over the amount recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has been proven to cause thyroid function suppression in previously healthy adult women and men.[41]\r\n\r\n[edit] Cancer\r\n\r\nA 1985 animal study showed that young rats fed large amounts of soy products as their primary food source showed an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. This is probably because rats are extremely sensitive to dietary protease inhibitors like those found in soybeans, which can disrupt the action of digestive enzymes needed to break down protein. This condition has not been found in many other animals, and is not known to occur in humans. [citations needed]\r\n\r\n[edit] Health food stores and soy\r\n\r\nSoy consumption has been popularized by natural food companies and the soy industry's aggressive marketing campaign in various magazines, television ads and in health food markets. Research has been conducted examining the validity of the beneficial health claims with regard to the increase in consumption of soybeans which mimic hormonal activity. A practice guideline published in the journal Circulation questions the efficacy and safety of soy isoflavones for preventing or treating cancer of the breast, endometrium, and prostate (although the same study also concludes that soy in some foods should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health) and does not recommend usage of isoflavone supplements in food or pills.[42]\r\n\r\n[edit] \r\n\r\n","retrieved_on":1473808408,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"culgz","parent_id":"t3_ul4x","edited":false,"author":"devils_advocate","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25204-57286fa1-a167-448f-868b-e86d68edbcb0-1566236767"}

Fame is \"free\", if I post a video and everybody sees it, instant fame. However, sharing the fortune is a different issue. By allowing me to use YouTube's bandwidth to post content on my site ([shuri](http://www.shuri.org) :) ) and profit from ad revenue they are sharing their fortune.\r\n\r\nI believe this measure is more important as it applies to the contributors not the passive viewers. The contributors are what makes all this possible. According to this measure YouTube is major Web2.0.\r\n\r\nThe challenge remains for YouTube itself to make a profit too.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nUri","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wd4b","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167457826,"score":0,"ups":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58310-88ba6dda-6789-45cc-8f33-20cfb0061f25-1566236780"}

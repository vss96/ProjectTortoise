None of it involves more \"designer's perspective\" than you yourself could get by spending ten minutes on a 'history of console gaming systems' page.  It is absolutedly riddled by idiotic, meritless assertions such as 'the PS3 is evolutionary, not revolutionary' and 'Nintendo is betting the company on the Wii'.  There is no value here.

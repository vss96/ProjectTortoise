{"controversiality":0,"body":"Uh... that shows up in orthodox jewish culture right now.\r\n\r\nThough I once heard that the reason for it is _not_ what it seems.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the story goes something like this..\r\n\r\nIn the times of the temple, there was a certain festival once a year, the celebration of the \"drawing of the water.\" (I think the water used for cleaning up the aftermath of the sacrafices)\r\n\r\nAnyways, during this there'd be all sorts of stuff, with the kohanim juggling fire sticks and doing other stuff.\r\n\r\nAaanyways, generally the women would get pushed to the back and not get a chance to see the show.\r\n\r\nOne year, it was decreed that the front should be reserved for the women to make up for this.\r\n\r\nDidn't quite work out, men pushing forward, trampling thw women, etc...\r\n\r\nNet result, it was decided to set up a barrier and have from then on a specific section reserved for women.\r\n\r\nSorry, I can't cite much of a source for this, just was once told that story by a tour guide.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tu1t","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165516652,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"Psy-Kosh","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cu0eu","parent_id":"t1_ctwm6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808013,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14241-91d381b8-1ed9-4cd6-b7cc-99f39f70cf51-1566236762"}

{"link_id":"t3_u4l6","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"&gt;In a highly competitive market economy in an affluent western nation, for companies to survive by continuing to sell products to already wealthy people, they are compelled to use highly aggresive advertising techniques. This bullies people into retail therapy by attacking people's self-esteem and happiness and convincing them they must repair that with consumerism. Take away this system of corporate fascism and zombie shopaholics and we might get to know each other again, rediscover meaningful things in life, and be a lot happier. It may take some environmental or economic disaster for this scenario to come about though.\r\n\r\nI call bullshit.  One broken RC car at the age of 6, and I've never believed or cared a wit about something I saw in a TV ad ever again.\r\n\r\n&gt;Work less, buy less, help other people, hang out with your friends more. How about that for a recipe for happiness?\r\n\r\nDamn straight!  I just have to figure out the \"work less\" part and I'm set.  Of course, working little, buying little and having few to no important-sounding official positions means I'll never have a girlfriend... but you have to make sacrifices to achieve things.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165644223,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cu7ky","parent_id":"t1_cu63p","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"EliGottlieb","retrieved_on":1473808147,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17978-06805aa8-2686-4f4c-ad98-7ec37a7d974e-1566236763"}

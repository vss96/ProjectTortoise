In fact European Jews run away from Christian prosecution to Muslim countries.  For instance, Turkey has a large Jewish population, most of them went there after Spanish inquisition. \r\n\r\nJews and Muslims  as far as religion is concern don't have any issues, in fact many similarities, much more so that with Christianity.\r\n\r\nMuslims, Christians, Jews, Atheist.... have problems with political ideology of Zionism.    The issue is not religion, the issue is land, resources, occupation, statehood, human rights....\r\n\r\nAl Queuda's political ideology tries to use Islam to explain itself, just as Zionism tries to use Judaism.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day  you can \"hate\" Al Queda and no have issue with Islam as religion, just as you have to distinguish  between Zionism and Judaism.","link_id":"t3_v1y6","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808742,"distinguished":null,"author":"dmehrtash","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv3bt","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv232","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33564-40aaca1b-56ff-4a1f-8b46-3d6e262e9bd0-1566236770"}

(It almost works in the US if you fiddle with the numbers, but we have a ton of farmland per person, and good farmland at that) Europe and China do not.\r\n\r\nDo keep in mind that the key thing is that energy must be portable to be useful in a lot of our current uses. So wind solar and tidal, are no better then infinitely more constant nuclear energy as far as that goes. \r\n\r\nThe sidelining of oil as an energy source going forward would be a major shock to numerous markets. Most of the alternatives would require massive infastructure changes. (I.e. the replacement of many cars, changes at filling stations, transport and delivery changes, etc.) It would not be a small thing. It would not be the end of the world, but still not small.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56662-ba630a5c-09a6-4234-bf3f-cb798ad483e4-1566236779"}

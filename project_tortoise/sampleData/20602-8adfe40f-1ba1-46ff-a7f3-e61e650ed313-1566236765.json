The debate goes on for a bit and then Obey makes this comment:\r\n&gt;What this process reminds me of is\r\nsomething that happened a number of\r\nyears ago when Mr. Gingrich was\r\nSpeaker and Steve Gunderson, a Republican\r\nfrom Wisconsin, was chair of\r\nthe Dairy Subcommittee. Steve had expected\r\nto be able, on the farm bill, to\r\noffer an amendment to the committee\r\nproduct dealing with milk marketing\r\norders. He wasn’t allowed to do that,even though he was the chairman of\r\nthe subcommittee handling the bill,\r\nInstead, what happened is that there\r\nwas an insider’s fix between then-\r\nSpeaker Gingrich and then-chairman of\r\nthe Rules Committee, Mr. Solomon.\r\nThey guaranteed that in return for\r\ntheir sweetheart deal, Gunderson\r\nwouldn’t even be able to offer his\r\namendment on the floor.\r\nWe have seen all too much of that for\r\nthe past years around here, and so I\r\nhave no illusions about what is going\r\nto happen to this bill, but I for one\r\nwant to object to the fact that it is on\r\nthe suspension calendar. \r\n\r\nThe Republicans lost the House and Senate because of nonsense like this. The sad part is the Democrats aren't any better - Senator Reid, the chief proponent of this pos, is a Democrat.\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20602-8adfe40f-1ba1-46ff-a7f3-e61e650ed313-1566236765"}

They have markey share which is everything in this business and nobody can touch them because there's nothing they could offer to be better. Maybe they're the smartest capitalists of the whole bunch. \r\n\r\nIf the day ever comes where they are short on money for some reason they have many ways they can deal with it rather than being already optimized for profit and having to look at what to cut. What a terrific business knowing that you'll never have to endure layoffs or worry about what to sacrifice to keep a profit.","ups":76,"score":76,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165858023,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ug5r","id":"cugge","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Quicksilver","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808313,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22653-fbff4db7-b664-47ab-9eba-1c1dd01ce3d5-1566236766"}

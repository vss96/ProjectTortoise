What's to argue with such a brilliant statement. Simpleton.\r\n\r\nThe article is not about wether or not the couple was rude or self control. It's about wether they were discriminated against.

They have a reputation of equality to uphold.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t6wc","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7521-5fa018c7-0df9-4cfa-9cc4-63327a841ddf-1566236760"}

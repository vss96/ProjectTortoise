{"body":"So what *are* you referring to when you say '[continuum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_%28mathematics%29)' and '[continuous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_%28topology%29)'?  These words have definitions, and the definitions do not involve any reference to information.\r\n\r\nSpacetime is modelled as a continuum.  In any frame of reference the evolution of a field is a continuous map from a set with continuum cardinality (the real numbers) to another set with continuum cardinality (a tensor bundle).\r\n\r\nIf you think these concepts are 'trivial' or 'meaningless', then that's your problem.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vb4k","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166540378,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"acrophobia","edited":false,"id":"cvcyy","parent_id":"t1_cvch7","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808925,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38328-5f09be9b-d082-41a1-8332-9a17aa329190-1566236772"}

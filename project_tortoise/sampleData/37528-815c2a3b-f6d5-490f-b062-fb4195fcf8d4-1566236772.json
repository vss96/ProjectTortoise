{"body":"Possession is based on actual usage. Property is based on control, on being able to sell, rent and destroy something. Having a right to possess something gives you NO rights to sell it, rent it out, or to destroy it.\r\n\r\nIf you're familiar with right-libertarian thought then it should become obvious that human beings are incapable of selling or renting out their bodies the same way they do any other property. Your body ALWAYS remains under your control. Because it is your possession.\r\n\r\nTrade without consumption and production is a caricature of economics. Market fundamentalism, based on a trader mentality, is an abomination.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ug5r","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166502041,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"richardkulisz","id":"cvb6b","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv8z8","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808891,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37528-815c2a3b-f6d5-490f-b062-fb4195fcf8d4-1566236772"}

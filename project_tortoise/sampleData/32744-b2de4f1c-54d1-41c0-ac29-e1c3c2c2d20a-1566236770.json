Not because he wrote 4 times the number of lines but because he solved the problem in 50% of the time. \r\n\r\nReducing productivity on line count is always wrong. Its wrong if your boss thinks that writing 2000 lines means more productivity then writing only 1000. And its also wrong if some geek thinks that 5 lines of code to solve a certain problem means that a language is more productive than an other language which needed 10 lines of code to solve the same problem.\r\n","link_id":"t3_uzuc","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808714,"distinguished":null,"author":"kawa","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_uzuc","edited":false,"id":"cv1ss","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32744-b2de4f1c-54d1-41c0-ac29-e1c3c2c2d20a-1566236770"}

Eclipse's refactoring capabilities are an attempt to mimic what Smalltalk tools had many years before Java existed.\"\r\n\r\nIt isn't that refactoring can't be done in dynamically typed languages, it is that not all the refactorings that are possible in statically typed languages can be done in dynamically typed languages.  For example, because of duck typing it is is hard to do 'rename all uses of this method on this class'.   Because of this kind of thing, Eclipse doesn't just mimic what Smalltalk had in terms of refactoring - in many areas it exceeds them (I know this because I have been a Smalltalk developer).\r\n\r\nStatic typing has real advantages for development of large projects because code can be analysed and refactored very easily.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166916312,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cvvoo","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvsup","author":"decaff","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809285,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47882-5a95ee64-dc6f-452b-9f37-0e5f8191b862-1566236775"}

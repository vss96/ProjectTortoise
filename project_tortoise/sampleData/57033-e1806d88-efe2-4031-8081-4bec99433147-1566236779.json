I am wondering why you keep on repeating this over and over.  I know that infinity is not a number, and that is precisely why I am using it to debunk this ratio-comparison junk science.  **Ratio comparison necessarily involves this \"bogus made-up impossible math operation\", that is why it is nonsensical.**\r\n\r\nI really don't understand what you are arguing about.  You seem to agree that infinity is not a number, you seem to agree that infinity should not come up in a good theory, you seem to agree that infinity *has* come up when this theory is applied in the real world.  Surely the only conclusion is that the theory (of inter-theory ratio comparison) is wrong?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8sr","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57033-e1806d88-efe2-4031-8081-4bec99433147-1566236779"}

People like her (and of course she's a woman driver as well) are a danger to everyone. If she doesn't know where to get off the highway she should pull over to somewhere safe, get out a map and READ IT! Then she should stay in the slow lane until she is ready to move to the exit lane at least 500 meters in advance. \r\n\r\nPeople who just drive around without thinking deserve to lose their no-claim bonus like this silly bitch. It's just a pity that slamming into her rear penalizes the guy behind.\r\n\r\nHow's this for sheer woman driver stupidity? I was approaching a long overpass bridge with 2 lanes open in my direction, and one lane approaching. I drove up on the right lane behind a car that was driving erratically over both lanes. As I got closer I could see a woman with a phone in one hand, a kid bouncing around in the front seat trying to grab the steering wheel, and the woman trying to fend the kid off with her other hand. I tried overtaking on the inside lane (we drive on the left in Thailand), but had to pull back when she veered over without warning. Then I waited until she seemed to be driving in a straight line and I over took her. As I did so, she started veering again. Not only was the phone still in her hand, and the kid jumping around, but she was reaching down to the floor, apparently trying to find something she dropped; perhaps her brain?. I drove off as fast as I safely could. This is not an isolated incident. I always see women drivers driving much slower than the other (mostly) male drivers, talking on the phone or doing their makeup. And they wonder why we complain about women drivers? \r\n","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473808146,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu7jn","parent_id":"t3_u62g","author_flair_text":null,"author":"ThaiTai","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17954-be3a4855-e330-4ea2-8e99-c9ddb0b7e0eb-1566236763"}

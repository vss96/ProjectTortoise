Four in five college grads are unable to \"compare viewpoints in two editorials\"? At that point, the study is calling itself into question more than it is its subjects.\r\n\r\nI'm sure it was conducted with the best of intentions, but [so was this](http://www.pdeng.uwaterloo.ca/), and the first offering of *it* came back with ridiculous failure ratesâ€”swaths of students apparently unable to function with adequate professionalism in their respective workplaces. (I'm told that more recent iterations have brought its conclusions more in line with the reality that employers are on the whole very satisfied with the performance of UW co-op students...)\r\n\r\nI didn't read the 15 pages, so I have no idea how much detail is provided about the methods. Regardless of all that, I'm still very cynical about the whole thing.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166333486,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33419-7076ecad-3e7b-4ee7-be68-7f1a04e2ed07-1566236770"}

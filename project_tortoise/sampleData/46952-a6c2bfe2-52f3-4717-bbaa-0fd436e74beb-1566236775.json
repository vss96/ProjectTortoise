I really think that would be the ideal solution- consumers enjoy the convenience and freedom of being able to access a digital library of all media in existence with no costs to limit one's freedom to explore, while content creators profit because consumption skyrockets. Not only that, but profit is directly proportional to the popularity and the staying power of the product.\r\n\r\nThe [most viewed video on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg) has been watched 37 million times in 8 months. It's 6 minutes long, so  if the creator were paid .001 cent per minute, that would work out to $223,000. Of course, that's probably a bit higher than reality, because I'm sure a lot of those viewers only watched a minute or two, so maybe it works out to more like $75k, but that's nothing to sneeze at for 8 months, and you have to keep in mind that the video will be up there for decades to come. It could be watched billions of times.","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46952-a6c2bfe2-52f3-4717-bbaa-0fd436e74beb-1566236775"}

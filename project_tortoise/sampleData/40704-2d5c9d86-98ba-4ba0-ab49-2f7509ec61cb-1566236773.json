{"controversiality":0,"body":"She has an Erdos-Bacon Number of 6.   \r\n\r\nBut I think it's time to define the Erdos-Bacon Temperature that takes into account the hotness of the subject.  Clearly, hotness is relative to the frame of reference of the person calculating the temperature, but using the following formula:\r\n\r\nT = 20 * h / e\r\n\r\nwhere h is the hotness on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the hottest) and e being the Erdos-Bacon number I am able to calculate the EB Temperature for...\r\n\r\nNatalie Portman = 20 * 8 / 9 = 17.8\r\nDanica McKellar = 20 * 7 / 6 = 23.3\r\n\r\nObviously, hotness needs to be defined for both men and women, and that probably needs a reliable source of hotness data.\r\n\r\nJohn.\r\n","link_id":"t3_vfbm","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166620323,"score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_cvft8","edited":false,"id":"cvhgu","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809013,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40704-2d5c9d86-98ba-4ba0-ab49-2f7509ec61cb-1566236773"}

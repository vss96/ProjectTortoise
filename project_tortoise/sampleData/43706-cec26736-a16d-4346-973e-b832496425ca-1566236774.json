{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vhr9","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","body":"I second wxPython but for different reasons (although strictly speaking, I've only used wxWidgets). But for me the main criteria for choosing a GUI is to make sure what you write won't become obsolete. If that's your criteria then you should use a library that a) is cross-platform and b) uses native widgets sets. \r\n\r\nCriteria a) ensures that you're not trapped on any one machine and you can easily move between them. I've had the pleasure of seeing the same code compile on three different platforms without a line change.\r\n\r\nCriteria b) ensures that any changes to the platform *automatically* flows through your program. Besides, I trust the platform's GUI designers over new-widget-designers any day.\r\n\r\nThere is only two cross-platform native-widgets GUIs that I know of: C++'s wxWidgets and Java's SWT. And if you like Python, then that leaves the wxWidgets wrapper: wxPython.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166723974,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"cvnk1","parent_id":"t1_cvi5y","author_flair_text":null,"author":"bosco","retrieved_on":1473809131,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43706-cec26736-a16d-4346-973e-b832496425ca-1566236774"}

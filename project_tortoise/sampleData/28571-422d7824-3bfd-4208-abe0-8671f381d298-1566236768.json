I never said anything about computer programmers.  Where did you grab that from?\r\n\r\n&gt;This becomes clear once you get to the higher level CS courses.\r\n\r\nI'm a business major.  Most of us split when we get our MBA.  We then end up managing over people who drone on and on about these computer science theories in our office while we rush to put together productivity charts in MS Project.

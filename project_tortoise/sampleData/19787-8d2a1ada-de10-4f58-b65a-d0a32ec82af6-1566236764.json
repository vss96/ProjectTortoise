Therefore, all I see is a link to a video -- which to me does not seem all that bad, and then all these posts saying \"Oh how horrible these kids are being brainwashed etc\" ---- so what am I to think? I said before if someone has other video to show me --- that changes things.\r\n\r\nHaving said this, the above 3 points never came up in any Christian summer camp *I* ever went to. I think it goes without saying that this quote: \"I want to see them [kids] radically laying down their lives for the gospel as they are in palestine, Israel [Middle-east]\" is disgusting (if intended as it sounds) --- and I am curious to know what Becky Fisher herself said about it.\r\n\r\nI do not believe it means she wants them to grow up to be suicide bombers.

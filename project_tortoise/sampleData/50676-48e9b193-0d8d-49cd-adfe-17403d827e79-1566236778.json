{"body":"Ruby. Ruby offers clean syntax, an elegant and thoughtfully designed object model with open classes, all the power of multiple inheritance without the complex overhead via Modules and mixins, and a variety concise, expressive little featurettes that just make coding more pleasurable (blocks/iterators, method names ending in ! or ?, option parenteheses, etc). I also find the available community and libraries to be vibrant, friendly, and focused on quality and best practices.\r\n\r\nPython nearly scratches the same itch, but I am very much turned off by explicit self, all those underscores in method names, and the lack of multi-line lambas or any other substitute for the blocks that Ruby offers. I also find a far wider gap in terms of API design and coding styles in the Python world than in Ruby, which adds conceptual overhead.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vzw8","subreddit":"programming","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1167109730,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"blakewatters","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_vzw8","edited":false,"id":"cw14y","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809388,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50676-48e9b193-0d8d-49cd-adfe-17403d827e79-1566236778"}

Three astronomers, Xiang Zhan, Xin Li and Jin Zhu of the Beijing Planetarium, photographed the encounter through a 4-inch telescope.\r\n\r\n&gt; \"Although the two objects looked so close,\" says Zhan, \"the ISS was about 400 kilometers above us while Saturn was over 1.3 billion kilometers from Earth.\"\r\n\r\n&gt; Their video illustrates something not widely known: The ISS looks wonderful through a backyard telescope. Solar wings and living quarters are clear and distinct. Seen from Earth, the station is wider than the rings of Saturn!","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166541055,"score":13,"ups":13,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vd0q","edited":false,"id":"cvd13","author_flair_text":null,"author":"gIowingsheep","retrieved_on":1473808925,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38357-2ac37b80-a519-4737-876b-3c1f06b7415e-1566236772"}

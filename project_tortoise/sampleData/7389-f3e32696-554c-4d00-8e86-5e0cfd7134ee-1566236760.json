You could take the view that the car is acting intelligently.  So I'm intelligent and the car is intelligent, but the car's intelligence is merely a consequence of my own.  Now if instead the car is controlled by an AI program running on the car's computer, then it's acting independently of my will, so you can no longer consider me a component of the car.  Basically, our idea of intelligence entails the existence of will (free or otherwise), and will can't be divided up.\r\n\r\nSo, the statement \"the universe is intelligent\" can be interpreted in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. \"The universe is intelligent because it contains intelligent beings.\"  An atheist wouldn't dispute this.\r\n\r\n2. \"Even if you don't consider humans and any similarly intelligent beings as part of the universe's intelligence, the universe has some other sort of independent will that makes it intelligent.\"  If that were true, it would be an observable phenomenon, but we have yet to observe anything of the sort.","link_id":"t3_tivn","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7389-f3e32696-554c-4d00-8e86-5e0cfd7134ee-1566236760"}

Yes, *theoretically* the market, at any given point, will be in a state of equilibrium (fairly valued, as many bears as bulls, etc.).  However, in practice this is far from true:  irrational investors (somebody might be irrationally bullish on MSFT, perhaps offset by somebody irrationally bearish MSFT, but arguing the inefficiencies will tend to offset isn't a convincing argument for market efficiency), inside information, that markets take time to move (there might be a \"fair\" value, but the price doesn't instantly move to that fair value, it's gravitates there, and people buy/sell at \"unfair\" prices all along the trip).\r\n\r\nYou make it seem like any trade is a roulette spin which ignores the real-world factors of information/technology imbalances, etc. (and the very fact that arbitrage, though it might be diminishing, still exists).","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165858879,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22689-00e38062-b835-4a0e-95b0-41cd08972705-1566236766"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"I'm no apologist for Israel, but is is clear that Ahmadinejad is stirring s**t to enhance his own regional stature. Iran has no strategic interest in waging war against Israel except to rouse the Middle Eastern rabble.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I am very tired of Israeli excesses, but Ahmadinejad is way worse and more dangerous. No, I don't want a war with him, I don't believe the \"axis of evil\" rubbish, but the guy is toxic. Why on earth schedule a Holocaust skepticism conference, if you aren't, at some level, anti-Jewish?  Hell, I respect Norman Finkelstein, detest the Israeli occupation, and am annoyed at the influence of Israel in American affairs, but there are certain lines you just can't cross without being a raving Nazi apologist.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wif3","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167542972,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":14,"ups":14,"author":"anonymous-coward","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_wif3","id":"cwiq7","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809720,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59709-689e0200-c4ec-40a9-8f14-c06b88644946-1566236780"}

Old evolutionary pressures have been squashed for awhile.  However the pressures and processes are only truly subverted if a)somone who wouldn't otherwise reproduce has children and b)overcoming whatever that negative is isn't in itself a trait toward strength.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps getting plastic surgery allows somone who would otherwise be rejected to look normal and reproduce.  Maybe it is to the benefit of other traits that person had which are more important to our overall survival.\r\n\r\nAnyway I don't think we've managed to completely subvert evolutionary process, it looks like we're about to face a mass extinction event.  So that in itself will be the ultimate evolutionary test.  I wish my kids weren't going to have to deal with it, but there it is.\r\n\r\nIf we do come out of this with our technological knowledge intact, it will be because of that knowledge.  It may be that we push on.  After all evolution is happening on two planes now; the physical and the mental.  And the latter one is going way faster than the physical one.\r\n\r\nI'm in danger of rambling so I'll stop here ;-)","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vqk3","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","created_utc":1166822166,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":2,"score":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46190-6467b54d-eac4-4733-9a49-c1b30696c7e6-1566236775"}

But adding new things to a programming language isn't always more, sometimes its even less.\r\n\r\nThat is true. While I think Java needs more, it certainly cannot add everything under the sun.\r\n\r\nAs for LINQ, it isn't just a set of libs; it is pretty deep into the language itself. That's what makes it so cool. \r\n\r\nQuery comprehension like LINQ doesn't provide caching. If you use LINQ with databases, as opposed to objects or XML, it gets translated into straight SQL calls.\r\n\r\nLibrary based O/R mapping, on the other hand, scares the heck out of me. Seems like it would be way too easy to bring back the entire database by creating the wrong object.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wcxk","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57846-3e55dc61-9212-4042-897b-0963977a0419-1566236780"}

They use them because it's nice for them.\r\n\r\nNo checks = no printing, mailing, cashing, bouncing, verifying, forgery, errors, etc.\r\n\r\nMany Americans (think the ladies writing checks at the grocery store) can't even figure out how to use a debit card, let alone set up a wire transfer with their landlord.  So the banks don't want to piss them off and get rid of their checks.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I hate checks, but the European bank's aren't altruistic.  Hell, they make you call a 900 number instead of an 800 number, since it cuts down on their phone calls...\r\n\r\nUS banks screw you in less-obvious ways.  ATM fees (not present in Netherlands),  \"floating\" your electronic transfers and checks so that they can get interest on them, etc.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809421,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw2vz","parent_id":"t1_cw2lh","author":"furyg3","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51541-590f9124-0d62-46c7-9c8a-a31d9ef421c6-1566236778"}

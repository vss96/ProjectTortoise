Many people I've read say they don't like CL, or they think it's ugly, but I can't figure out why-- lisp-2, #', funcall, but I don't use funcall very much at all, and #' is two characters. There are sometimes too many options for some of the more esoteric library functions, but they are invisible if you don't want to use them, for the most part. \r\n\r\nI'm not saying you're wrong to avoid CL-- I sincerely suspect I might be missing something, given the number and quality of people who have rejected CL.

Most of the \"disturbing facts\" being peddled on right wing blogs about this are actually disputed allegations. \r\n\r\nOne of the \"suspicious activities\" mentioned to the police (and dealt with in the report) was that one of the imans was seen tearing up some paper and stuffing it in the trash. According to the report, one of the officers actually retrieved the paper from the trash bag and it was nothing more than a printed-out flight confirmation and a baggage id #. \r\n\r\nAmazing how even the most innocent action can sound sinister if you're paranoid enough.","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37343-ee215433-9f8a-4d97-bae8-76be9490db70-1566236772"}

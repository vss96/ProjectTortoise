{"body":"Not enough. In terms of functional features I'd lump it with Python and Ruby. In all these languages there are some helpful nods to functional languages. You might even write code in a functional style with some discipline.\r\n\r\nIt's just that you could learn any of those languages well, work and acquire prominence in their communities, and still know only a little about functional programming.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that's bad. You can get a lot of useful work done and not know a lot about functional programming. I did.\r\n\r\nBut the answer to your question is no.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_u3p2","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165599170,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"darrint","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu4x2","id":"cu52p","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808098,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16432-15652439-88ba-4775-ba74-31d59472e879-1566236763"}

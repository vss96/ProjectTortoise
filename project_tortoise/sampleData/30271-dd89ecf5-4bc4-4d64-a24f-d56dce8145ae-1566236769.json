I've written PHP apps that I really wished were Java.  I've also written PHP apps that worked very nicely, in a fraction of the time that a Java version would've taken.  And I've written Java webapps that really should've been PHP.\r\n\r\nPHP is good when you can use it as it was initially intended: the language itself as a templating engine, little or no business logic, just pull things out of a database and stick them on the screen.  It's much, much more productive than almost anything else for those quick &amp; dirty webapps.  If you find yourself looking at templating libraries, PEAR, lots of business logic, intermingled HTML + code, or third-party libraries, it's usually time to pick another language.\r\n\r\nI usually have a rule of thumb for how large my PHP apps are allowed to get.  No more than 1 file of helper functions, no libraries other than what comes with PHP (I'll sometimes make an exception for PEAR DB), no PHP code in layout other than `≺?php foreach($row in $data) {?&gt;`, `≺?php if($condition) { ?&gt;`, `≺?php echo $row['var'] ?&gt;` and `&lt;?php } ?&gt;`.  All querying &amp; logic is in .php files which set some variables and then include .tmpl files with the above restrictions on tag use.  If I can't elegantly construct the app like that, I use a different language.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808608,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuuf2","edited":false,"id":"cuw8j","author_flair_text":null,"author":"nostrademons","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30271-dd89ecf5-4bc4-4d64-a24f-d56dce8145ae-1566236769"}

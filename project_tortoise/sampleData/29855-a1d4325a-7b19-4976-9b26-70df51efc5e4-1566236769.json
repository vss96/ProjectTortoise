{"controversiality":0,"body":"The *simplicity* that Don Norman called overrated really is the good kind of simplicity that means the product doesn't distract you from your DNA spreading activities. He says that by making the car or the word processor *look* complicated you will sell more of them because people will look at them and be all \"Gee, this thing is so awesomely powerful that it could probably spread my DNA all by itself\". Then later on they will be in trouble because the thing is a pain to use, but then it's too late - they already bought it.\r\n\r\nJoel is saying something different: \"Make sure the product can do what it needs to do; whatever you do don't remove features in the name of simplicity\". But then he goes on to say that if you can get all the features in, then simplicty/elegance/usability/design is very worthwhile: Use all the tricks in the book to reduce complexity: move the advanced features to advanced pages; don't ask questions I can't answer - etc. etc. He wrote an entire (highly recommended) book about it.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we have covered the opinions of those lesser spirits, here is *my* take: They are both right, things that look complicated really are easier sells than simple things.    *However*, if you do manage to sell the simple thing, and it works really well, and gets your users laid, you will gain *brand loyalty*, which means people will come back and buy the next version, and anything else you produce.\r\n\r\nAs an example, consider a world where nobody has ever heard of search engines. You get a choice between the insanely complicated Altavista and the almost insultingly simple Google. You have no idea which is the best; all you can evaluate is the UI. And you only get one chance: once you pick one, you can never use a different search engine.\r\n\r\nWhich one do you pick? You pick Altavista, because of all the awesome *features* that you can see on the screen. \r\n\r\nFortunately for Google, in the real world you *do* get to change your mind, so once you have tried Google a couple of times, brand loyalty will make you never even *look* at Altavista again.\r\n","link_id":"t3_uv0q","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166162438,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"cuv7x","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uv0q","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808589,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29855-a1d4325a-7b19-4976-9b26-70df51efc5e4-1566236769"}

As you noted, etc does not stand for 'other junk', usr does not stand for 'user stuff'. To use full names would give new users a false understanding of the best way to use these folders.\r\n\r\nThe original purpose of this is because files are handled via the keyboard in linux.\r\n\r\n&gt; there are a lot of legacy applications out there whose programmer would not bother to follow convention (remember that Windows has a much wider developer base, and thus of lower quality on the average as well).\r\n\r\nWow, that's quite a problem. Might as well give up..\r\n\r\nThe precursor policies to LFS however, did find a solution. File permissions, another key ingredient, (+also incredibly missing from windows:)) force the drunken coder to follow the seperation of user and system data. The most evident way in which this is implemented is by giving regular users write access *only* to a few key folders: /home/username/, /tmp.\r\n\r\n&gt; This was what I meant, and this is probably what you meant.\r\n\r\nNah. I was refering to the ability to mount or mount -bind a partition to any folder. This would allow you to put your pictures partition at c:\\documents and settings\\user\\pictures, or something like that, for example. Then, when you want to back your stuff up, you can just point you software to your \"home\" directory with all of the mounted partitions under it. This has added benefits such as allowing you to have encrypted folders and all sorts of other stuff in your home folder - a problem which MS incorrectly tries to solve at the fs level.\r\n\r\n&gt; it's most likely the software vendors you need to blame.\r\n\r\nIndead. Those guys in redmond really have caused the rest of us a lot of pain:)","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2039-6c4fa669-c4d8-43e6-8ea5-5f3a299b6831-1566236758"}

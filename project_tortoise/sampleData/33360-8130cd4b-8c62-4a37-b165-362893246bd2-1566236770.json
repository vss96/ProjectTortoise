He may have been hungry and thinking about food. Someone gets his heart. Recipient says she would love a beer and chicken nuggets after her surgery. She also now likes green peppers.\r\n\r\nA guy dies after a music lesson thinking about his musical ambitions and love of classical music. The heart recipient gains a new fascination with classical music.\r\n\r\nTeen, probably speeding, dies in a car accident. Recipient gains newfound lust for adventure.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the supposed gained memory is very narrow and seems to be correlated with what was recently on the minds of the organ donors at the time of death rather than being some \"core\" inherent trait. The shock of finding memories that don't seem to belong makes people focus and speculate with unending fascination on what probably should have been a very temporary memory.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v2k5","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808735,"distinguished":null,"author":"jimmyr","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cv2py","edited":false,"id":"cv2xj","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33360-8130cd4b-8c62-4a37-b165-362893246bd2-1566236770"}

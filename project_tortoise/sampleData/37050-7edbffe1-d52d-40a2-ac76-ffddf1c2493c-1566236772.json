Religion is at fault here.\"\r\n\r\nHow about religions that don't demand stoning to death non-believers?  Or individuals who hold religious beliefs, but stoning apostates not one of them?\r\n\r\nThese conversations always devolve into shouting matches partly because people are overly broad with their generalizations and terminology.  Does ALL religion demand the death of those who disagree?  Most?  Some?  A few zealots?\r\n\r\nI think those qualifiers are fairly important when you suggest that \"religion\", as some generic, abstract entity is responsible for killing people.\r\n","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166483759,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cva7c","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv7hm","author":"jimbokun","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808873,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37050-7edbffe1-d52d-40a2-ac76-ffddf1c2493c-1566236772"}

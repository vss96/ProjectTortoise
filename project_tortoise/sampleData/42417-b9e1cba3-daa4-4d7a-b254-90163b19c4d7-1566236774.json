{"body":"&gt; I don't think it is a religious thing. I think it comes down to the fact that effective birth control is relatively new, and there is a lot of social inertia.\r\n\r\nReligion *is* social inertia.\r\n\r\nI'm quite certain that the taboo against premarital (or extramarital) sex originated for the practical reasons you describe. In fact, I'm pretty sure that nearly *all* religious taboos originated for practical reasons. The problem is, once those taboos were encoded in religious dogma, they developed the ability to outlive the practical reasons that required them. And this is a perfect example of that.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vh1r","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166669179,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"diamond","parent_id":"t1_cvilh","edited":false,"id":"cvkuc","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809079,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42417-b9e1cba3-daa4-4d7a-b254-90163b19c4d7-1566236774"}

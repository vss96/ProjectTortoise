{"controversiality":0,"body":"Exercising one's right is not suspicious. By this reasoning, everyone who's ever sought legal counsel in a criminal matter must be guilty, as if you were truly innocent, you wouldn't have anything to hide from the police, right?\r\n\r\nAll the tasks you claim the police were doing could've been done without entering or damaging his vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe police knew what their responsibilities were, and had the tools to legally accomplish those responsibilities in a painless manner -- Breathalyzer, eye-exam, and sniffing his breathe for alcohol. They could've run plates for warrents/tickets without entering it.\r\n\r\nAll of which they know, what they did was deliberate and intentional overstepping of their power \"to teach him a lesson\".\r\n\r\nCops power trip all the time. And the sad thing is its very hard to terminate a police officer for misconduct without hard evidence. Mainly because a fired cop doesn't have any alternative career choices, really.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wgpl","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1167537142,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"redrobot5050","id":"cwiig","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwhde","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809717,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59610-cd224e09-df3a-44be-bf62-8fb3e73ac737-1566236780"}

But corruption happens regardless and there is no way even with election to avoid corrupt elected officials.\r\n\r\nA random selection of short term officials is likely to have insufficient time to become corrupt enough to manage it.  If you, for example, were randomly picked, you'd have to not merely choose to be corrupt, but also get enough of the other folks to go along with your plan.\r\n\r\nI personally believe that a random selection of people would have enough integrity to not allow you to manage it.  However, I could be wrong.  \r\n\r\nWhat kind of way would someone stick it to the country in a system as I describe?  Assume that no group can vote for money for themselves.  For example, congress could only vote for a raise for the senate, and only the senate could vote for a raise for congress, but only one raise could be given every 3 years.  So if congress votes senate a raise, those congressmen can't see a raise themselves for at least 3 years, beyond their terms.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166991270,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvvfe","edited":false,"id":"cvxr1","author_flair_text":null,"author":"nosoupforyou","retrieved_on":1473809325,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48894-1bf9dfda-8456-4511-817a-b5918bb138a2-1566236777"}

Eastbound flights to Australia from Germany are 22 to 26 hours long (with layovers of course).","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wcxh","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809752,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Herzenslust","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wcxh","id":"cwkfx","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60585-e87e1d90-a31e-47f6-8d8a-306e01fae3cd-1566236780"}

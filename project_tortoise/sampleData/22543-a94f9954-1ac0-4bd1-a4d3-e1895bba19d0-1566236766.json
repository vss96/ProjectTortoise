Sounds likely, since he's a MS stooge, probably doesn't look beyond his Visual Studio window.  Dismiss emacs+slime?  I'm sure he's afraid to look at it because it makes Visual Studio look like an idiot's toy, and that would invalidate his work.\r\n\r\nActually, it seems there is a disconnect even amongst the lispers.  Reading about Baker's talk from that link provided, it seems like he doesn't know there's a whole group of people fixing the libraries, IDE, and implementation issues in the open source community.  He's not even aware of CMUCL (and SBCL), which performs static type analysis, and has been around since the late 80s.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if the old-school lispers were unaware of these new developments (last 5 years or so).\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uefm","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808309,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ricercar","edited":false,"id":"cug8z","parent_id":"t3_uefm","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22543-a94f9954-1ac0-4bd1-a4d3-e1895bba19d0-1566236766"}

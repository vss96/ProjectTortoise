The Martian dust, of which there is a lot, is swept around regularly in massive dust storms. It's particles are probably eroded to a very smooth and almost spherical shape. That coupled with the dryness and weak gravity could mean that when they are deposited after a storm they are susceptible to flow down gentle slopes and cause features that look just like a liquid flow. These particles also would have different colours depending on where the storm swept them from so they would be deposited in layers - that would lead to clear patterns when they flow.\r\nI'm not a geologist, planetologist or scientist of any description (except wannabe) so this explanation is probably complete nonsense!","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13564-648b33d7-5643-4619-8edd-3f120991f83e-1566236762"}

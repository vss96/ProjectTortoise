The STL has map and first class function like constructs.\r\n\r\n    for(list::const_iterator i = list.begin(); ...\r\n\r\n&gt; This won't happen with the first two examples because they give no room for customization.\r\n\r\nAre you advocating use of hamstrung programming constructs to avoid typo bugs?  This is dumb.  Constructs like the classic for loop can make very elegant and flexible code.","controversiality":1,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808029,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctz0t","edited":false,"id":"cu1dz","author":"kkrev","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14635-f48567de-5cc7-4b56-954b-08d5077729eb-1566236762"}

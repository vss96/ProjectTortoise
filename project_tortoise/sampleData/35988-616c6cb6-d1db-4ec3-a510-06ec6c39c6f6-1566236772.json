Religion is at fault here.\r\n&gt;&gt;Fortunately for us, most Christians treat the Bible as a smorgasbord, not a set menu.\r\n\r\nI think literalists / fundamentalists are the ones ruining everything, and I mean literalists on all sides, from the Evangelical Christians to the Muslim Fundamentalists to the Atheists who unilaterally condemn all religion as if it were made up solely of fundies. The *marginal / fringe* psychos are all yelling so loud that people are forgetting that that's all that they are...a fringe minority.  If we could get over this PC bullshit where we're too afraid to hurt anybody's feelings or say, \"No, that's bullshit, you're wrong\" they would be without power, but everybody's too afraid of showing what might be construed as religious intolerance, even if it's against the most intolerant groups.\r\n\r\n**Quick Note:** Re: 'smorgasbord': I think that largely applies to people who are Christians out of habit, if you know what I mean.  Of the Christians I know who are actually 'devout' / 'true believers' that don't advocate stoning non-believers for instance, the leading thought appears to me to be that the Bible is largely allegory and parable. That seems to be the true form of people who say it's about 'the message'; it's not picking and choosing what to believe, but rather writing the whole or nearly the whole thing off as fiction, so to speak, with nuggets of wisdom that are supposed to make you think, not be taken literally.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808833,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cv7jh","id":"cv85c","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"oditogre","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"35988-616c6cb6-d1db-4ec3-a510-06ec6c39c6f6-1566236772"}

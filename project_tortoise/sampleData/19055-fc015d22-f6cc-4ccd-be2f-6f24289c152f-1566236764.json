The dose used was only enough to get to \"level one\" which is basically about what a \"2 beer buzz\" would be. No hallucinations. Once again, as with my first attempt, within a half hour of injestion, I could feel my head clearing more than it had been in years (except for the last shrooms experiment). Also my sinuses cleared and I could breath easily through my nose for the first time in years. Even during remission periods, my sinuses have always been swollen. The only \"side effect\" other than a slight buzz is that I get a case of the \"giggles\" and spend a few hours smiling at everyone.\r\n\r\n&gt;A couple more doses and the worst cycle of my cluster life (20+ years) was completely broken. Regular maintenance doses have worked to keep me cluster free now for a longer period of time than any other in the last 20 years.","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165700059,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"science","edited":false,"id":"cu9o3","parent_id":"t1_cu9mc","author_flair_text":null,"author":"isalpha","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808185,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19055-fc015d22-f6cc-4ccd-be2f-6f24289c152f-1566236764"}

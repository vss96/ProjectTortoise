The real reason here is that Java requires lots of manual optimization because of its less powerful evaluation model: We can't use 'reverse' on the list because that would be to costly. In Haskell its quite possible because of the different language semantics. And the inferior OO-model of composition play a big role here, too (thats a problem for all OO-languages).\r\n\r\nIf we had a Haskell language with a more elaborate syntax (Haskell is IMO a bit to concise) that wouldn't harm and could even improve readability and thus productivity.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_twtt","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13983-01b5c0ef-36e1-4f81-9f59-593d359eeeb1-1566236762"}

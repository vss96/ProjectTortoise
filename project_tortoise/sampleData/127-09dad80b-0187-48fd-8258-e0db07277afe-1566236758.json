Iran happens to be one of the most oppressive nations in the world.  Surprise, they are a muslim nation.  The fox fans are simply reacting to what they see as a hypocritical leader trying to get a rise out of the US.  It worked.\r\n\r\nBut, the irony is that these are the same people that support the invasion and occupation of Iraq for no apparent benefit other than to show the world 'we mean business'.  I am sure there were some intelligent, well thought out responses to Ahmadinejad's letter that didn't try to pick a fight with their president.\r\n\r\nAll the comments on Reddit so far critisize the fox responses as typical US ra-ra garbage.  Some of them are.  However, others actually have substance to them.  We are justified in our concern with Iran.  Please don't forget that.  Also don't forget that Fox has the final say about what kind of tripe goes up on their website.  Ahmadinejad was trying to get a rise out of the fox newsies just like Fox news was trying to get a rise out of you guys.  Keep your heads and foster some critical discussion.

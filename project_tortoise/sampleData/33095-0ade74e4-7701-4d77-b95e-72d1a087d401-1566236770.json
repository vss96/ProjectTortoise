Without going top-down first, how can we know what 'bottom' parts we need to write? So the top-down approach simply is the most natural one.\r\n\r\nYes, I know about the old rule of 'top-down analysis and bottom-up implementation'. But I think thats a result of not sufficient powerful programing languages (in particular certain dynamic ones which requires lots of testing, because of the lack of a type-system which does the same automatically).\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uzuc","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33095-0ade74e4-7701-4d77-b95e-72d1a087d401-1566236770"}

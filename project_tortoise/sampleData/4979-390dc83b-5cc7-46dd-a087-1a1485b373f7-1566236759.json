This alone can make a 75 degree room feel 65, and you'll save money on the AC bill.  \r\n* Replace incandescent bulbs with CF (take them with you when you move out if you can't afford to leave them for the next tenant)\r\n* Set your computer to sleep when it's idle for a while\r\n* Wash clothes in cold water, wash and dry full loads only\r\n* Turn off \"heated dry\" on the dishwasher\r\n* Set the refrigerator at a modest temperature\r\n* Talk to your landlord about improving the efficiency of the building/complex.  This might seem like a long shot, but I know a landlord who installed double-pane glass in 24 apartments less than a year after 4 tenants asked for something to reduce heating bills in winter. \r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;landlords...have no interest in energy efficiency\r\n\r\nLandlords are also in the business of keeping tenants happy in their flats. Don't be afraid to talk to them about what's important to you as a tenant.  Assuming you're nice about it, they'll probably appreciate the insight.  \r\n","ups":6,"score":6,"created_utc":1165159896,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"science","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4979-390dc83b-5cc7-46dd-a087-1a1485b373f7-1566236759"}

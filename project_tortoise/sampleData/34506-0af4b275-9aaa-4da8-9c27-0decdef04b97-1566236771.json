After walking in the desert for days, he collapsed of dehydration and believed he would only be alive for a few more moments.  A tigress came to him, and dragged his body to a near-by oasis, made him drink, and brought him food.  She and he lived together for some 3 years and they developed quite early on a sexual and intimate relationship, believe it or not; very consensual, I might add.\r\n\r\nWell, he was eventually \"rescued\" but the braindead soldiers killed the tigress when she came to visit the guy; he was so sad he killed the two who killed her and then killed himself, I believe.  They made a movie out of it.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v4ak","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34506-0af4b275-9aaa-4da8-9c27-0decdef04b97-1566236771"}

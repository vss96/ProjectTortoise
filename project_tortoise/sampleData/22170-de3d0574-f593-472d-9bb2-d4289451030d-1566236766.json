As you can probably imagine, he is innudated with people wanting to discuss or merely harangue him. It is very nice (if a bit peculiar) that it has caught the public imagination in this way but it is already impractical to answer comments individually. The plan is to collect the background material, especially the stuff on analysis, and make them available. Hopefully people will get a much better sense of the tradeoffs entailed then.\r\n\r\nI have worked with James for many years now and he is indeed quite a character and wonderful fun to work with! Naturally, he is well aware of abelian groups, topological spaces, hyperreals and, although controversial, the work has indeed been professionally and independently reviewed.\r\nAt this point in time, it looks very like the theory is both coherent and useful. It certainly has the right tradeoffs for the domain we are working in. \r\n\r\nPersonally I have not formed a view on the wider significance of the work, which is really what fuels this discussion.\r\nQuite a few people have observed the close relationship between James's approach and the IEEE floating point standard. If you are interested in learning more about this, that is a very good strand to follow. Should people want to discuss this further with me, they are welcome to email me at nullitytalk@mac.com.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808293,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_ty8s","edited":false,"id":"cuff3","author_flair_text":null,"author":"sfkleach","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22170-de3d0574-f593-472d-9bb2-d4289451030d-1566236766"}

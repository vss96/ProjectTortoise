I to this day will never eat at quiznos again because of this commercial.  Everytime I think about a quiznos sub I think about one of those abominations inside.\r\n\r\nI don't care how hip it was.

Wrong product to market with it.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166122643,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_curt6","id":"cusp1","edited":false,"author":"jward","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808542,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28531-8ad7a8a0-a069-4878-9afd-7759efce6672-1566236768"}

You need to read the actual studies before inferring findings that don't exist. (AND you need to take a class in statistics and probability)Or on the other hand, if you don't know what you are talking about, why talk?\r\n\r\n All of those studies are confounded by gender bias and no study has been able to remedy that. Having said that, all of the studies that do show a difference have a relatively small margin of difference with an enormous overlap of the sexes - so, while the studies have found that a greater percent of men do better than women in math, it CANNOT be inferred that \"men are better than women\" in math. In fact, it supports social stereotyping of women as the basis for their small numbers in math fields because the percent of women doing better than men in these studies is higher than the number of women in some of these fields.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166127197,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28747-b585db3d-fe82-4b26-8af3-1442d715f006-1566236768"}

What *happened* to it? It's alive and well with its friends, Big Foot and Nessie.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, I've been online in one form or another since 1987. I've never met this \"online etiquette\" of which you speak.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works: a small group forms. On usenet. On a mailing list. On a web site. Where ever. The small group of people are nice to each other. The group grows. The diversity of opinions grows and controversy starts getting a little heated. Maybe the moderator/administrator/whatever tries to keep things calm by banning users or editing posts. \r\nPerversely, this causes things to get worse because now (some) users see this as \"The Man Is Keeping Us Down\" and they start trying to deliberately create arguments. Or maybe not, maybe the moderator insists that \"free speech\" is too important to censor and that BigDogDick should be allowed to post his ASCII art of butt sex, even though the purpose of the forum is to discuss knitting patterns.\r\n\r\nAnd straight down the toilet you go. Eventually, a small group, fed up with wading through the flame wars, trolls and spam, splits off to form another group where people can avoid all the garbage. \r\n\r\nAnd the cycle begins again.","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40747-466f34e6-bd9b-45b0-be73-b85a354a4fc7-1566236773"}

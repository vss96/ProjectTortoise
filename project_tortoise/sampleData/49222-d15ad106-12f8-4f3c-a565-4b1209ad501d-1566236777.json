The brainwashing of innocent children with unsubstantiated information - utter nonsense at times. And this goes on well into adulthood. If you think about why it came into existence in the first place it was fear, and exploitation. \r\n\r\nIn all religions there are priests of some sort or another who \"know more\" - know more previously told lies, and make up new ones. These priests exploit the ignorant masses for their own ends. Historically people were hungry, tired, poor and would grasp at anything someone would say about a \"better tomorrow\". Priest exploited this weakness to the hilt. They created hell and damnation for those who didn't believe them - and created false promises of heaven for those who did... All this itself is bad enough. On top of this, they propagated hate based wars against other similarly stupid religious systems - nothing but a political power struggle.  Millions of people have died over the millenia because of this. People are still dying today over some stupid religious issue or other. In the US on 9/11 , UK, Spain, Iraq, the middle east, India, Aghanistan, Pakistan -  Indonesia - wherever you look.\r\n\r\nSo at best Religions give people a false sense of hope and security. At worst it kills people. Frankly I don't see any redeeming value at all.\r\n","retrieved_on":1473809337,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvyd5","parent_id":"t1_cvy0n","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Raoulmeister","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49222-d15ad106-12f8-4f3c-a565-4b1209ad501d-1566236777"}

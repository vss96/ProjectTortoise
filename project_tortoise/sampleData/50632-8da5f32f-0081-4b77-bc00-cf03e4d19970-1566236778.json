This should be pretty obvious considering that statistically speaking males commit more crimes then females (and more violent ones at that). Be it socialization or genetics, it's a feature that extends beyond the bounds of the school and into every aspect of life.\r\n\r\nThe other thing to consider is relative value. While University remains exorbitantly expensive, a degree is worth less and less with every passing year because it's more common then it was say... forty years ago. There is not an anti-male bias, it's just the same stupid trend females have of occupying niches that were previously dominated by men while they simultaneously decrue. Think of it this way... Once upon a time the secretaries and typists of the world were men. Now a lot of previously prestigious office jobs our ancestors would have killed for are low status positions occupied primarily by females.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the males are going into trades, where the money is.\r\n\r\nSo one could guess there’s probably academic discrimination against males going into the social sciences the same way that a boy who announced ‘I want to be a hair dresser!’ has his masculinity derided.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_fead","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1167107801,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50632-8da5f32f-0081-4b77-bc00-cf03e4d19970-1566236778"}

These women produce dominant forceful, offspring, and so on.\r\n\r\nMen like to pick and choose their partners - getting raped is bad from a biological perspective, because it denies mate-choice. But having children who are rapists might turn out to be genetically advantageous, if rape results in reproduction. This tension might result in a preference for women who are bit rough rather than genetic dead-ender milquetoasts.\r\n\r\nHence the best sex of all for a man is forceful sex from a woman he's hot for anyway - she gets both mate choice, and rough, reproductively successful offspring - and this is what the original author ignored.\r\n\r\nMen have varying preferences - it has been shown that Men tend to prefer effeminate women most of the time (nice guys, who hang around and take care of the kids), but can switch to love-em-and-leave-em girls.\r\n\r\nWe are what was evolutionarily successful, not what we would like to be morally.\r\n","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1165121769,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4487-13323b36-c720-4be8-b0c0-a1e50af134e2-1566236759"}

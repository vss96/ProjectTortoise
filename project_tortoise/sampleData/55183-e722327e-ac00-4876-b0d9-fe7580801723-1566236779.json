We have much more experience in measuring the height of people than in the age of planets.  For example, over thousands of years there has been no order-of-magnitude change in the value attributed to objects of human-like size.  During those thousands of years, the best estimate of the age of the earth has changed wildly.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way, what is the probability that at some point in the future, scientists decide that the age of the earth is actually 8 billion years?  Without knowing too much about it, I'd give it a probability of greater than one-in-a-million.  Maybe the earth was created from matter other than that of the rest of the solar system.  Maybe some cosmological model will drastically change how 'time' happened during this epoch.\r\n\r\nNow, *if* this \"age of earth / height of human\" analogy is apt, then the probability of the earth being 8 billion years old should be equal to the probability that I am actually 3m tall.  But this would make me the tallest man on earth by a long long way.  It would also make all prior measurements of my height totally wrong.  Certainly this is not a one-in-a-million event.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167327567,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55183-e722327e-ac00-4876-b0d9-fe7580801723-1566236779"}

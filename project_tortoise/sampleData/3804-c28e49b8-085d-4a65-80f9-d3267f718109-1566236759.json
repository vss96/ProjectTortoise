{"body":"My theory of how feminism messed up, slightly:\r\n\r\nFeminism saw the patriarchy, with all of its power structures (education, church, work, sexual double standards), and said *This is bunk! Men and women are fundamentally equal! Inequality is a social construct.*\r\n\r\nBut at a certain point, it stops being a social construct, and you run into a brick wall called Charles Darwin. And it becomes difficult to disentangle social constructs from hardwired biological predispositions. \r\n\r\nAre men really more aggressive, and does this mean that women will always be a minority in business, science, and government in a laissez-faire society? Can feminism even address questions like this honestly. I'm not saying that the answer is *yes, women will always be a minority* but I'm saying that feminism may be unable to face the question head-on, on cold scientific terms.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tcpy","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":33,"ups":33,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165093928,"author":"anonymous-coward","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctd9y","edited":false,"id":"ctdj2","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807582,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3804-c28e49b8-085d-4a65-80f9-d3267f718109-1566236759"}

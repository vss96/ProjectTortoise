Coal particulates cause about 30K premature fatalities per year in the USA. If you value a human life at 1 million dollars, then this is $30 billion. Total electricity production is 4 Terawatt-hrs = 4e12 w-hrs = 4e9 kw-hrs = 200 billion dollars at 5 cents/kw-hr. Coal accounts for half of this, so just the fatality cost of coal from particulates alone is about a third of the price of coal power, or 1.7 cents per kw-hr.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tywe","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","created_utc":1165551577,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15333-ac0b0755-c7f8-4a43-a4a2-ada0915f77f0-1566236762"}

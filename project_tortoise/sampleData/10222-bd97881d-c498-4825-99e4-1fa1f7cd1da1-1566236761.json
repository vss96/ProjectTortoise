Part of the problem with the whole discussion is that it compares the most simplistic pop music, in that I think people are thinking of bubble gum music, to the most accomplished classical music, which is pretty unfair.\r\n\r\nThe reason, as I'm sure you know, people play power chords through distortion is that the overtone fills in the chord.  That's what I'm getting at - distortion doesn't JUST garble the sound.  It changes it, pitches it, and allot of other things.  If you have more than one amp with distortion, you get allot more clashing and effects.  Obviously some musicians use these instruments better than others.  Even within the subject of power chords and distortion, we could get into an area in which modern audiences have become more accepting of non-classical rules of harmonics, but...I don't believe I'm going to develop any traction in this forum.\r\n\r\nBTW, I work with a composer who is classically trained, and he agrees with most of what I'm saying.  I'm not saying that that makes me right, just that I'm not totally nuts.","link_id":"t3_tn3v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807848,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctrh9","id":"ctrlv","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10222-bd97881d-c498-4825-99e4-1fa1f7cd1da1-1566236761"}

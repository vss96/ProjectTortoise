{"body":"Okay,\r\n\r\nRss readers are patentable for what reason? Doesn't this make one think that maybe the concept of patents itself may no longer be a viable option? Using patents to trim out a niche market you can utilize to extort rent from users and/or competitors may seems like a really great thing to some, but it is a stupid stupid game. The whole idea of software patents has spawned the free software movement which is in the long term process of killing the patent based software business world.\r\n\r\nAnd make no mistake the vast majority of patents are bullshit. Legal bullshit at this stage of our civilization, but bullshit still. I agree that the process of patent claims exist in the steps you list above, and that this is a pretty standard business practice at this time. But that doesn't make it any less of an asshole move, or Microsoft's seeking of a patent on obviously community developed software any less asinine. And this is really the thing that sucks about this patent it is clearly an obvious derivative work of long discussions and efforts in the RSS community.\r\n\r\nIf there was something novel here I might respect this patent attempt, because frankly I respect patents on novel inventions. However that said, novel software, which this patent clearly isn't, like novel mathematics at this point do not belong behind a patent wall. The power of ideas comes entirely from sharing them, not hiding them and using them as weapons against others.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vptf","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166805500,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"smacfarl","edited":false,"id":"cvr9w","parent_id":"t1_cvq3b","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809202,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45594-048a02cf-aad5-401b-a200-48f23fd53b47-1566236775"}

I too was baffled, and I might have to side with the shoolz (comment below) but I don't want to because I want to get paid! :)  If you take a look at the person who bidded on my item, you will see that his feedback and the items he won amounted to .04 dollars. He bought .JPEG pictures from Ebay and got quick feedback. I'm a little suspicious, but he e-mails me on his personal email account saying he will pay Sunday, so we'll see.  I hope STOMICRON (comment below) is correct on his assumption.  I did get positive feedback from him, but I will make sure that things are clear with Paypal. Anyone have advice on whether to worry about a cleared payment or not?","link_id":"t3_tdu0","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807621,"distinguished":null,"author":"ajzab","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctfi5","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tdu0","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4693-442df3a1-be7f-42de-a90a-6df4d9ae41d8-1566236759"}

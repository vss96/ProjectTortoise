The hydrogen is also much safer*, and does not weigh a car down like batteries.\r\n\r\nThere are some tech alternatives proposed for the compression/transport part of the problem, but since that only accounts for a 28% loss there's not much gain to squeeze out there.\r\n\r\n*[A hydrogen car with a punctured ignited fuel tank next to a petrol one](http://www.policy.rutgers.edu/ceeep/newhome/images/Swain_h2.jpg), compare with [batteries](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeWq6rWzChw&amp;eurl=), but also electric car batteries provide extremely high voltages with no real 'off switch' during maintenence or after a crash.","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_uhwu","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808359,"author":"TheCookieMonster","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uhwu","id":"cuitj","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23970-2bfad573-79d1-4c13-a8f5-5d266aa16631-1566236767"}

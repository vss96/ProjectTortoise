And how exactly are you going to magically transform every SUV into a Honda Civic? Just trash them all and pay a trillion USD to Japan to ship 100 million of them over pronto?\r\n\r\nBesides, your numbers are bullshit. Even if the USA switched its transportation infrastructure over to rail, it would only ACTUALLY save 5% or so off of the USA's oil consumption. This despite the fact that rail is EIGHT TIMES more efficient than roads. By your simple-minded reasoning, switching to rail should cut consumption by &gt; 40%, not 5%.\r\n\r\nI admire how casually you dismiss the deaths of millions of Americans. I mean, I despise Americans but you give me something to look up to, see? The breezy way you say \"over a couple of years, people would adjust, lifestyles would change, and the economy would start to recover\" without even mentioning that millions would die in the transition or that it would \"recover\" to a tiny fraction of its original size (maybe a tenth to a fifth). I love that kind of casual cruelty.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166707271,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43081-a52bbe0e-1c63-41c0-96fe-445de791dc79-1566236774"}

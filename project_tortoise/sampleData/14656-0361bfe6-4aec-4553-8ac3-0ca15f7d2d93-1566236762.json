Identifying yourself as a &lt;language&gt; programmer is annoying.\r\n\r\nBut he *is* a Smalltalk programmer, in the same way that I'm a Lisp programmer. Sure, he knows other languages -- he may be damn good at using them, and know their special concepts and idioms -- but Smalltalk has a pretty clear dominant influence on his thinking. For example:\r\n\r\n&gt; Though you can represent anything with a string, itâ€™s ignorant to do so. Every program should not be expressed with only Strings, Chars, Booleans, Integers, Doubles, and Decimals. Build your own primitive types and use them as such. Things like Money, SocialSecurityNumber, Address, Contact, User, Name, Email, Url, Company, and OrderNumber can all be primitives as well.\r\n\r\nThat looks like a characteristic Smalltalk attitude. Haskellers and MLers are similar, but they'd talk about defining new data types. Lispers tend to lean more toward using the built-in data types since they're so easy to manipulate (an attitude shared by Python programmers).","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165528041,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":17,"ups":17,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu1c5","id":"cu1fh","author_flair_text":null,"author":"sketerpot","retrieved_on":1473808030,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14656-0361bfe6-4aec-4553-8ac3-0ca15f7d2d93-1566236762"}

First of all, most things bought at auctions are sold because the owner wants to get out of it quickly and they are willing to accept a value below market value.  Therefore most of the people bidding on those homes were probably looking to buy them below market value.  The fact that those particular homes sold so much below market value is anecdotal evidence and doesn't diminish the published statistics on home sales.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect is the pure cost of those homes.  I know there are areas where homes are extremely expensive, but those types of homes suffer the most during a housing market correction.  People making 50 to 100k a year just can't afford to buy a $800,000 home.  The reality is that very few people can afford to pay that much money for a home, and in a tight market people aren't going to stretch and pay for an overpriced home.\r\n\r\nAs the parent poster noted, many areas of the country are still booming in Real Estate.  Where I live houses are still going like hotcakes, but it helps that the prices of homes range from about $130k to $230k for the 80 percentile.  I seriously doubt our market will experience a severe correction in housing.  Even if it does slow down, we won't experience the drops in prices that an area with average price of $417,000 per home would.\r\n\r\nOverall I thought the analysis of the article wasn't very deep, and was generally prone to driving irrational fear.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807939,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctvp8","edited":false,"id":"ctwj5","author":"beowulf","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12605-0b35acfa-9c52-457f-ab9d-ca04a173a3c3-1566236762"}

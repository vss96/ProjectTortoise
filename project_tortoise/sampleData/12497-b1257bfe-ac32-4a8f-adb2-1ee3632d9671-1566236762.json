Because if a product development person just knows the features a product has to deliver it's because there's already enough direct or indirect thought about the concept by industry stakeholders that you can bet some other company is already far enough down the development path that you'll never catch them. I think that's what we're seeing here. The stunning accuracy of the predictions tells me that the communications industry knew these things were coming. AT&amp;T didn't have a hope of catching the other companies who'd figured it out first.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tska","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12497-b1257bfe-ac32-4a8f-adb2-1ee3632d9671-1566236762"}

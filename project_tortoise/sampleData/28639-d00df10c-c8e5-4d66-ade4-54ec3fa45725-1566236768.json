Why on earth would you use a method to increment a variable?\r\n\r\nI wanted to compare method invocation. I've added the \"increment an instance variable\" to not have empty methods to avoid that Ruby and/or Python eventually perform optimizations that they wouldn't do on non-empty methods.\r\n\r\nWhat wonders me though, is that although I've explicitely stated that it is a micro-benchmark and that I've not said that Ruby is in practice faster than Python, all that have replied assume that I have exactly said that.\r\n\r\nI've said that method invocation is faster in Ruby, and I still think that it's true.\r\n\r\n_Edit_:\r\n\r\nWell, English is not my native language, and after looking \"universally\" up in the dictionary, it seems that I didn't actually express what I wanted to.\r\n\r\nThe sentence in my original post should read more like \"Python has a bytecode interpreter, yet not all common operations in Python are faster (...) than in Ruby.\"","controversiality":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166125478,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_curv1","id":"cusx5","author":"shit","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808546,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28639-d00df10c-c8e5-4d66-ade4-54ec3fa45725-1566236768"}

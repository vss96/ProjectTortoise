Literal is \"something with senses\" but philosophically there are many variations, usually involving varying levels of intelligence, awareness, conciousness, etc. I am sure that you are educated to know the differences and that we both subscribe to different interpretations of what sentient is. It was my mistake not to frame it in context.\r\n\r\nMorality is very much subjective, and I agree I believe that an injustice against a human is far greater than any multitude of injustices against animals. That said I don't advocate animal injustices (which there are many), but killing an animal humainly is not. It is the natural process. That said I doubt we could come to consensus on that view.\r\n\r\nThere are both good and bad cholesterols. For example my doctor suggested for me to eat a lot more fish because it is high in good cholesterol.\r\n\r\nTrue, I allow some irrational reasons a free pass, but that in no way makes the other reasons any less irrational. That arguement is an ad hominem, as you are advocating that my other points are less logical because I am saying them and have in a different case expressed what appears to be an irrational comment. Religious reasons are very involved and in this context I just choose not to oppose them.\r\n\r\nNow for the final comment on rights, I wholeheartedly oppose that assertion. Animals don't have rights. Rights are institutionalized by a society. Rights can be taken away. Protection under law doesn't imply individual rights. Now this is an ongoing debate, with different views from different schools of thought. I draw from rights scholars such as Michael Ignatieff, who has written extensively on rights.\r\n\r\nYou may believe differently, but currently under both national and international laws animals don't have rights. Animals don't have the right to life as society hasn't bestowed that. And that debate really comes right back to the beginning of what sentience means and who it is applied to. It hasn't been resolved in millennium and I don't expect it to be resolved in my lifetime.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uvjp","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808781,"distinguished":null,"author":"Kratoz","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cv56h","edited":false,"id":"cv5cd","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34582-3b022772-eab3-4a42-9874-df2395cc3bda-1566236771"}

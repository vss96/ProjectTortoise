You're right the that impact of verbal abuse is lessened for many of us when it occurs over the Internet.  If I receive a nasty comment or email from someone, I'm inclined to write it off entirely rather than expend emotional energy thinking about.  But does my restraint make the offender's offense any less sociopathic?  Or does your decision to reply to a nasty comment or email with an equally scathing remark create an exchange that would otherwise be considered \"social\" or \"well-adjusted\"?\r\n\r\nI don't think so.   Sociopathic behavior is sociopathic behavior... even when it starts to become the status quo.  While growing up, I went to a school where it was the norm to start fights for reasons that didn't make a lot of sense to me -- territory, color of clothes, facial expressions, etc.  Yet though most of the guys participated, and though the emotional impact of each fight was dampened because of its inevitability and worthlessness, it didn't make the actions any less sociopathic.  It is the same, I believe, on the Internet.  It wouldn't be doing anti-social behavior justice to write its significance because, simply, it failed to make you mad enough or hurt you bad enough. \r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n-Dan","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vrnh","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47418-3561276d-aa8a-4354-a426-6acc54796e82-1566236775"}

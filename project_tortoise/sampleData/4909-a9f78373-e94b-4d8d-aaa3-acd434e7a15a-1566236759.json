The wikipeia editors should get off of their fucking high horse and accept that they are *not* the experts, and that google is not some omnipient all-seeing super being!\r\n\r\n&lt;/rant&gt;\r\n\r\nBut by all means, remove the ego-boosting \"I'm great\" articles.","score":20,"ups":20,"created_utc":1165154323,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4909-a9f78373-e94b-4d8d-aaa3-acd434e7a15a-1566236759"}

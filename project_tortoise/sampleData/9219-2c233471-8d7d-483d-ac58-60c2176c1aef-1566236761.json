Why, then, has McD's pricing shot up (despite not even offering a supersize anymore)?  I've quit eating there, simply because Subway or Hamburger Helper give me more food by a mile for the same $XX, and during lunch hour, I could probably damn near make some H.H. in the time it takes to get through the McD's drive-thru.  I recently realized that the lunch menu at a local locally-owned, operated-out-of-an-old-mansion classy restaurant place (it's where -everybody- not dead broke has gone for Prom night dinner for years and years) is only $2 - 5 more than McD's.  To hell with that.  Shrimp Linguine or save myself a couple bucks for a Big Mac is no debate.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807812,"gilded":0,"id":"ctpol","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tol1","author":"oditogre","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9219-2c233471-8d7d-483d-ac58-60c2176c1aef-1566236761"}

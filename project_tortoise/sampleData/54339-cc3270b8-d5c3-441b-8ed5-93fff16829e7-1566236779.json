A passage is more interesting if you show people's state of mind through their actions. So instead of saying \"'Oh no!' Mary said anxiously,\" you should write \"'Oh no!' Mary said, wringing her hands,\" or something like that. My examples may not be that good; this is just what I learned in 8th grade. This rule applies even when you aren't just using it for dialogue. (Why isn't dialogue in Firefox's spell-check dictionary?)\r\n\r\nAmazingly, I just found a wikipedia article on this. It really does have everything now, doesn't it.\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show%2C_Don%27t_Tell","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809518,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cw7tz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw74h","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54339-cc3270b8-d5c3-441b-8ed5-93fff16829e7-1566236779"}

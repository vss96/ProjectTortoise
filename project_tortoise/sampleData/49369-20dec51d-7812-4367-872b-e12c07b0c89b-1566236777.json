{"body":"I'm perfectly happy to take the last work in our debate. =)\r\n\r\nAs for intelligence driving selection, you have disputed none of the points. And as a large body of scientific work backs my position, you have lost.\r\n\r\nAs for your inability to understand the point I wanted to make about meaninglessness and life, the high down rating of my comments shows that others feel the same as you on that issue. So you can take heart in your camaraderie. I personally feel that you do the entire living community a disservice with your ideas about god and life. Your own body has no need for these ideas, much less other animals that you may meet. You can continue to stick your head in the sand, but you will never find true vision there. \r\n\r\nGood luck in your travels. Eventually, you'll get what I hinted at.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vx5n","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167018427,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"entropyfails","parent_id":"t1_cvxun","edited":false,"id":"cvym3","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809341,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49369-20dec51d-7812-4367-872b-e12c07b0c89b-1566236777"}

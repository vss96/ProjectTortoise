Yes, clean code is both satisfying and useful.\r\nI'm just worried about the impression made on newcomers.\r\nPeople like to hear how good THEIR code can be, not how their feelings are out of touch with reality, how magnificent someone else's code is, or how they'll never get some nice book based on an impossible challenge.  It's hard enough to learn Haskell even with the best of attitudes.  I should know, I'm just now slogging through monads and barely starting to see through the haze.  But other people seem to react negatively to the things I mentioned, and I wouldn't them to be put off from a good language because of that.\r\n\r\nEdit:  See lost-theory's post for a summary. :)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uzuc","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32748-2bbd3d5a-dc73-431b-99a8-0630539e7003-1566236770"}

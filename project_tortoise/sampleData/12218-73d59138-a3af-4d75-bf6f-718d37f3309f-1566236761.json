The ability to talk to users in a way that they'll actually give you good information.  Appearing accessible instead of having the users bitching about the system behind your back because they don't really feel like bringing the issue to you.  The ability to make your underlings work reliably and efficiently.  So in this way I'm equating management skills with people skills.  I'm not talking about just being a manager (since we all know they can be assholes), I'm talking about actually being qualified to be a manager.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12218-73d59138-a3af-4d75-bf6f-718d37f3309f-1566236761"}

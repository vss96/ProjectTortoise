None of the other lists claim to be top searched lists, they're hand picked from top search lists. They're meant to be an interesting look at how search statistics reflect what's going on in the world. Google's list especially has always been about this practice, specifically showing the \"movers and shakers\" in search. \r\n\r\nThe article is extremely misleading because the engines never claimed that their lists serve the same purpose as the processed AOL data. There are commercially available lists. Wordtracker offers one and there were articles a while back about Google offering one, for an extremely hefty price.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vgay","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809052,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dannyhw","edited":false,"id":"cvjip","parent_id":"t1_cvi6a","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41730-3a31cbe7-0f8e-47a0-b02b-31f3cb964355-1566236774"}

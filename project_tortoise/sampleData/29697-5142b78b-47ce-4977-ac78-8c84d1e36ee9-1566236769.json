In all four cases it was simply a legitimate criticism that was, in my opinion, true, being labelled as FUD. Twice it was an attempt to dismiss the argument by labelling it, and twice it was just a more innocent use of the word \"FUD\" to mean \"disagreement\", for which I'd point out we already have a number of good words.\r\n\r\nLanguage may shift and I won't try to label it good or bad. But I'd point out that we _have_ lost a valuable idea that we now have no word for if we let FUD mean \"disagreement\", not to mention that if we allow FUD to simply mean \"disgreement\", then we should stop allowing people to use it as some sort of pejorative. (You can't have it both ways; either the meaning has shifted and it's no longer a pejorative, or it's still a pejorative and it's almost always used incorrectly.)","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808582,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_us7b","id":"cuuu9","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jerf","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29697-5142b78b-47ce-4977-ac78-8c84d1e36ee9-1566236769"}

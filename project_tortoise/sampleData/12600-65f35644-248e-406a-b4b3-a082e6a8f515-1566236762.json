I've had fantastic doctors, but I've also had some bad ones. I'm just sayin'... Remember it's your life. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't sit there thinking \"he's the big smart doctor, and i'm just the little dummmy.\" You have a brain. Use it. That's my point. Don't let anyone else do your thinking for you.\r\n\r\nSome of these doctors commenting to me get so picky about every detail in the post (I know your not being picky :-)). I'm not trying to make a doctoral dissertation on the subject. I'm trying to make a point from my personal life. That's what my blog is about. Stuff I learn or have learned over the years that can help other people. You should have seen the mechanics attack me when I told people to go somewhere other than the car dealership when they get a check engine light. Man! You'd think I had desecrated the virgin mary, bombed mecca, or went on a racist rant.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should do a post about how I've learned there isn't single topic worth blogging about that isn't controversial.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tuzt","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12600-65f35644-248e-406a-b4b3-a082e6a8f515-1566236762"}

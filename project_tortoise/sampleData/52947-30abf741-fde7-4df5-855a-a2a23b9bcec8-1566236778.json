That said, sometimes bad timing, a bad title, or just plain bad luck can cause an interesting story to fail to get noticed. Feel free to post something again if you feel that the earlier posting didn't get the attention it deserved and you think you can do better.\r\n\r\nAnyway, there are two kinds of dupes:\r\n\r\n1. Those you've seen before: You say, \"Grr, i hate dupes. I wish there was some way to ban them.\"\r\n\r\n2. Those you haven't seen before: You say, \"Wow, what a great story!\"\r\n\r\nFor most people, (2) outnumbers (1) by a great deal, but since they don't recognize that they're dupes when they haven't seen them before, their perception is skewed. They don't realize it's a dupe, they don't soften their anti-dupe stance.\r\n\r\nIf we really did somehow ban all dupes, Reddit would be a quiet and boring place.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52947-30abf741-fde7-4df5-855a-a2a23b9bcec8-1566236778"}

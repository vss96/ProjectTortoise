Although she returned to Bahrain after 9/11, she didn't stay there.\r\n\r\nLonger story:\r\n\r\nShe tried to get US residency by applying for political asylum. Her asylum application was rejected. Then she applied for Permanent Resident status (a.k.a Green Card) as the spouse of a US citizen. An immigration court approved that in May 2001.\r\n\r\nThen 9/11 happened. [Thousands of Muslims in the US were rounded up and imprisoned under abusive conditions](http://www.antiwar.com/ips/fisher.php?articleid=4170).  The vast majority would be released (much later) without charge. A few would be deported. None of them would be found guilty of any terrorism-related offense or connected in any way with the 9/11 attacks, according to the ACLU.\r\n\r\nShe might have felt that the US was not \"a country with maximal individual liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThat same month (September 2001), according to [this](http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2001/Sep-30-Sun-2001/news/17116294.html),\r\n\r\n&gt;The Bahraini princess who fled her homeland to marry a U.S. Marine is returning home because her family fears for her safety in America, the couple's attorney said.\r\n\r\nShe didn't divorce her husband at that time. Her Green Card was contingent upon her remaining married to Jason Johnson for three more years. \r\n\r\nThey divorced a little more than three years later, so she is now able to legally stay in the USA.\r\n\r\nWhen she applied for asylum, she may have deliberately exaggerated or lied about the peril she faced back home.\r\nThe movie and other media pandered to stereotypes about Muslims and Muslim countries. But she certainly didn't get lashed, stoned, or executed on her return home.","controversiality":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166105281,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27945-5ecf8a65-f52f-4329-83b5-2fb1afbbd314-1566236768"}

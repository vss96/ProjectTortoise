Does the author live in one of those countries where it is illegal to worship at anything other than the state church (some countries in Europe still have such laws on the books), and believe that everyone pays attention to them?\r\n\r\nChristianity is so fragmented that you cannot speak of \"The Church\" as a whole.  You are either referring to your particular sect, or the actual church as Jesus set out.   The latter is by definition not corrupt (though if you don't believe in Jesus it doesn't exist).\r\n\r\nThere are many corrupt churches claiming Christianity.   There are a few that are not - at least not overall.  Judas was with Jesus, and still was corrupt.   All Churches have this, so you must take away the corrupt that have not been recognized.  Though looking at how the church treats things when someone is found to be corrupt can be enlightening.

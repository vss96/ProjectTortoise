{"body":"Although I'm glad people are skeptical of Google, I don't see any problem here at all.  I realize Google is inviting this sort of criticism with a slogan like \"Don't Be Evil\", but let's be realistic.  It's a link to one of their products, nothing more.  People get so bent out of shape about the subtleties of Google page design, but the results are still the results.\r\n\r\nWhen Google mentions 'evil' I think they were talking more along the lines of things like forcing OEMs to only bundle your OS, buying up promising startups just to kill their product instead of trying to compete, or paying 3rd parties to mount spurious legal attacks on open source software.  \r\n\r\nThe threshold of 'evil' must be higher... say manipulating core results.  And even if that happens I say it's more boneheaded than evil, because people will just pick up and use a different search engine.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w3h0","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167190738,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dasil003","id":"cw44l","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w3h0","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809445,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52246-523847d3-7405-4560-8039-2c7fa0a837db-1566236778"}

The law enforcement industry is creating these make-work problems.  Don't want meth labs?  Legalize the shit.

The word for this is:  INSANE.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself:  Why is middle America so desperately poor?  What is wrong in government that has led to such widespread poverty?  Is it the military/industrial state?  Is it widespread corrupt?  Taxes too high?  Too much regulation?

{"body":"Maybe the remark is because almost EVERYONE in America that says they're acting \"in the name of God\" is acting in a hypocritical way. There's Benny Hinn and his oceanfront spread in Orange County, California- paid for with tax-exempt church money and now worth approx $10M. And Ted Haggard- wasn't he the leader of about... 30 million evangelicals or so? Mark Foley, who as a \"good conservative, God-friendly\" politician masturbated while writing explicit gay instant messages to underage assistants. Don Sherwood was a good warrior for God while he was having an affair that included rough sex with his mistress. Duke Cunningham was definitely pro-God and was throwing fire and brimstone at \"shit chute f--ker gays\" himself while selling his office for a posh $3M mansion (among other things). George Allen always talks about God when he's not trying to censor himself from calling a black man a \"nigger\" and a man of Indian descent a monkey. \r\n\r\nBut these might just be the cases that get national attention. Surely, the \"Godly\" in my own hometown don't do these things? Well, I can tell you about growing up in the 1980's and hearing my Catholic Priest tell the congregation how AIDS was God's just punishment for being gay. Or my gun-toting neighbors who can't wait for the chance to shoot an Arab. Or a liberal, for that matter.\r\n\r\nThis is the new de-facto God. He can be whatever you want him to be. He is the basher of gays, the killer of Arabs, the holy tax-cutter himself, the one who says you can do anything in his name and use power any way you want to as long as you oppose abortion... Does the new God care if a homeless man is freezing on a cold nite this winter? Or about the hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqis that were killed in his name? Hell no!\r\n\r\nFace facts, if you talk about God in America, THAT is the God you are talking about. THAT is the new American Evangelical God! And Evangelicals LOVE IT!","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_td06","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":10,"ups":10,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165095900,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rayhoffman","id":"ctdmp","parent_id":"t1_ctdgz","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807585,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3858-125a34d4-ce90-4b4c-a91f-49c6229845a6-1566236759"}

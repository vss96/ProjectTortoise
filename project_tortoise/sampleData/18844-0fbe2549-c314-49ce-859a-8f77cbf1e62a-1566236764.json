Say what is does not do. This is a very good precaution, because if you donâ€™t find out the limitations you can be pretty sure that somebody else will.\"  I'm not sure that limitations should be emphasized, but not stating them at all is a mistake I sometimes see people making in EECS papers.  If the limitations of a work are clearly laid out, this helps people understand where the work is useful and where it is not.  It can also help other people to see how to improve the work.  Both these things help an author to achieve the elusive goal of significant positive impact (not to mention citations).   It's also good for friendly relations with the rest of the research community; people may get angry when they realize that a paper was less than frank.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18844-0fbe2549-c314-49ce-859a-8f77cbf1e62a-1566236764"}

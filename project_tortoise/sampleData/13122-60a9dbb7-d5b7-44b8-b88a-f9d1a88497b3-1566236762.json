Even now, I can spot the trend, as reddit gets more digg-like (you know what I mean..).\r\n\r\n&gt; enforce CAPTCHA (while submitting) or e-mail based registration to avoid Bots/spam..\r\n\r\nand keep more good people away?\r\n\r\n&gt; Implement kill files for the \"normal\" redditors to ignore trolls..\r\n\r\nWhy can't we let the wisdom of crowd work here so we don't each have to kill each troll individually?\r\n\r\nI think the lesson here is: democracy _backfires_ when your community gets too large. Only similar headlines appear. Only the comments that _please_ most people get upmodded, which actually decourages controversy. Without different opinions, we only get more sheep-like, and nothing good comes out of the community anymore.\r\n\r\nedit: markdown did it again..","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvsi","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807961,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Alpha_Binary","id":"ctxpc","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctwgs","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13122-60a9dbb7-d5b7-44b8-b88a-f9d1a88497b3-1566236762"}

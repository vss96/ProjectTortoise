Oh well. I think that, granted the innate Java awfulness, the program itself isn't too bad for bloat. But you're right, uTorrent is very streamlined. They're both pretty acceptable in my opinion, but certainly if you prefer uTorrent I could see how the possibility of it being made sucky could be bothersome.\r\n\r\nI guess the real reason Azureus's loading time doesn't bother me is because I generally leave it on 24/7 anyway (yes, I'm \\*gasp\\* a seeder!) just like I do with Firefox... so loading time doesn't make much difference. When I download a torrent in Firefox, it starts downloading right away, and that's good enough for me.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808042,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu225","parent_id":"t1_cu1s6","author_flair_text":null,"author":"cecilkorik","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14988-1d5c38ec-77fd-4c34-9758-52235e337e2e-1566236762"}

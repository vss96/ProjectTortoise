Companies like Blackwater definitely have a place whether it's providing training for domestic police or executing a humanitarian mission abroad. But both of those efforts are well defined with a starting point and an end that is specified in a contract etc. I would go so far as to say that if a military objective could be well defined, like put down this rebel uprising in country A, paid for by that country's legitimate government, Blackwater might be able to cost effectively carry out that kind of assignment.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the perspective of an individual soldier, idealism will always win over greed. Hiring tens of thousands of mercenaries, no matter how well paid, and sending them to an ill defined mission such as exists in Iraq today is bound to fail. It will fail simply because the employees are always free to move on to another contractor or just leave the area completely. If the situation gets too 'stupid' (to quote the article), a mercenary just leaves.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the US Army and a private military contractor, aside from the motivation (money) is the institution itself. Young recruits are brainwashed into the whole army and country and fellow soldier pride thing. The question of money doesn't stick around very long. Putting themselves at risk becomes an issue of camaraderie. A mercenary isn't in it for idealism or camaraderie, he's in it for a paycheck and while I agree with your statement about nationalistic patriotism, it does tend to win out over greed when the bullets start flying.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vg01","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1166627019,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40865-c88224d1-957d-48c7-8a60-2180370a59d3-1566236773"}

{"body":"I absolutely have a problem when an eight year old girl actor or otherwise is being paraded in front of millions of people as a tool to advance propoganda for *ANYONE* religious/political/whatever.\r\n\r\nJust because she is 'an actress' does not make her immune from the life-long association that could come as a result of this. Further, I *DO* have a problem with child actresses and actors being instructed to spew hate and curse words.\r\n\r\nFurther, I really do not believe for a second that the statement 'this video features a talented young actress' is anything other than a disclaimer to deflect criticism.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u9s2","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"created_utc":1165790866,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"CarlH","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cud5t","id":"cud7t","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808252,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20954-46a05bc9-6919-43b0-91d0-07f54220813e-1566236765"}

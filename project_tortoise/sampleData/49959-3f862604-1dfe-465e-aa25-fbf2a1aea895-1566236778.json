Look at Figure 2 again.  The crash risk is the same at 15 mph under the median speed as it is at the median speed.  Speaking of cherry-picking, I like the way you ignore the word \"much\" which precedes the word \"slower\" in the summary.    Reading the whole paragraph, it's clear they're talking about drivers who've slowed down considerably in order to turn off of the road, or who have just pulled onto the roadway.   \r\n\r\nYou're the one willfully misreading the study.  Look again at the **fatality** risks, which you're disregarding because they don't support your view.\r\n\r\nTo give a hypothetical situation, suppose the median speed is 65 mph.  The risk of crashing is the same if you're travelling at 50, 65, or 80.  However, at 50 mph you have a 25% chance of dying in those wrecks, while crashing at 80 mph will almost certainly kill you.  Look at Figure 5.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vjh2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"49959-3f862604-1dfe-465e-aa25-fbf2a1aea895-1566236778"}

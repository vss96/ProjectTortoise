It's strangely hypnotic... or something.\r\n\r\nNotice how they over-pronounce and enunciate everything, so that it will be clear when played at double speed. Pretty neat.\r\n\r\nI saw another version of this posted on CollegeHumor.com, and it seemed like it was slowed down too much. This one, at 4:42, is just right (my MP3 is 4:43... close enough). I believe the actual version of the song that I have is 2:21. I imagine the College Humor version is noticably longer, but they don't display the time anywhere that I can find for their videos.\r\n\r\nWhy this is on YouTube and not just an MP3 somewhere, I have no clue.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u38o","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808072,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"freshyill","parent_id":"t3_u38o","id":"cu3or","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15798-3746e71e-5dd6-45c1-99ca-673303cc35f4-1566236763"}

School is such a traumatic experience for so many that home schooling would produce less-scarred individuals.\r\n\r\nI *hated* elementary and junior high and it took years of A Chi Jutsu to keep myself from being viciously beaten up mentally and physically on a daily basis by a wide assortment of my peers (i'm a brown belt, fyi).  Even then, I would end up in physical altercations as I would routinely act in a hero capacity, racing up to jocks and pummeling them to the ground with a few select sweep kicks and punches to the groin when they would dare mock or physically assault some of my less-skilled brethren.\r\n\r\nAnd you don't EVEN want to have me overhear you emotionaly abusing your woman; i've sucker punched bosses before.  Threat of force is the only thing that affects such assholes.  Sooner you learn that, the better.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w4pi","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-3,"ups":-3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167244677,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53419-e0e74669-d75a-46fb-b64a-b3606d3414a0-1566236778"}

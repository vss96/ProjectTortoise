I'm sure interested people will account for this.\r\n\r\n&gt; Even if you don't, you should still be able to recognize that property is an extension of principles -- even if they're principles you discard as invalid.\r\n\r\nTreating your fellow humans as property (chattel slavery) is an extention of someone's principles too. Today we'd consider any such belief system ridiculous, but Mark Twain mentioned his mother's unconsciousness of slavery's grotesqueness:\r\n\r\n*\"She had never heard it assailed in any pulpit, but had heard it defended and sanctified in a thousand. As far as her experience went, the wise, the good, and the holy were unanimous in the belief that slavery was right, righteous, sacred, the peculiar pet of the Deity, and a condition which the slave himself ought to be daily and nightly thankful for.\"*\r\n\r\nMaybe these \"principles\" you mention are in fact appeals to authority.\r\n\r\n&gt; Thus, the requirement that for there to be a \"free rider\" problem there must be a finite resource.\r\n\r\nIf you have an infinitely replicable good (like say mathematical or biotech ideas), producing it may still be costly. The [free rider problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem) predicts that market economies underproduce these goods despite clear demand. Fulfilling this reasonable demand is a \"bad business model\", as you say.\r\n\r\nThe nation-state which upholds capitalism can also patch some of its worst weaknesses. I think the best explanation from experience [comes from Bill Gates Sr.](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/template.cfm?PubID=900584), which I won't quote but think is entertaining to look through.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ug5r","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165962085,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25771-294e93bc-cf21-441f-9329-f0a1dae13450-1566236767"}

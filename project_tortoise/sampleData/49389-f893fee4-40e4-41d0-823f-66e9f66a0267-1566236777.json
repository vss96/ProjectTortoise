{"body":"&gt; By means - I imply the religious believers who perpetrated the crime.\r\n\r\nSo in other words, you don't understand the definition of \"means\" when used in that context.\r\n\r\n&gt; but religion is very often the means used to manipulate the people who have to finally kill\r\n\r\nNo, still not the means there. The means used to manipulate them is quite generic, not religious at all. Others have done it in a secular fashion, and continue to do so in some part of the world or another. Think about it, if the means of manipulation is religious (even primarily), how can some neo-nazi whip up a bunch of skinheads to go vandalize a synagogue?\r\n\r\nRemoving religion will not do anything to slow (even a little bit) people from manipulating others in this fashion.\r\n\r\n&gt; Religion is the means of implementation.\r\n\r\nYes, they won't rely on nationalism or patriotism, or culturalism as an excuse for this sort of thing. How can you say such things? Are you really this naive?\r\n\r\n&gt; This is what I've been trying to drive into that thick skull of yours. Relgion doesn't have to be the motivator. A lust for power or money among a few could easily be that. But how are those desires met ? (Bin Laden didn't blow himself up, for example) .How do they manipulate the masses into getting what they want ?\r\n\r\nIn Binladen's case, he uses some bizarre form of nationalism more than he does religion. But I have the thick skull?\r\n\r\nReligion is stupid, no doubt. It's wrong on most of the important questions, and wants to make other questions that are completely unimportant something more than they are. Much of the time it can be annoying. But you give it too much credit when you claim it's the source of all the world's problems.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vx8t","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167019886,"ups":3,"score":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","edited":false,"id":"cvyn9","parent_id":"t1_cvyk1","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809341,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49389-f893fee4-40e4-41d0-823f-66e9f66a0267-1566236777"}

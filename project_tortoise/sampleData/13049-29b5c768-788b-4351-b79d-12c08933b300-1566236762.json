Either way, once a site is *out* of the queue, no one can put it back *in* (there must be *some* way...), so there will be no additional pestering once you're confirmed good.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ttdt","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807958,"author":"derefr","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctvx3","id":"ctxjh","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13049-29b5c768-788b-4351-b79d-12c08933b300-1566236762"}

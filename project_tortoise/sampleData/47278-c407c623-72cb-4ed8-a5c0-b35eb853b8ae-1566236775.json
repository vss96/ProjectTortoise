It's string theory.  Quantum mechanics has been *rigorously* tested, and its predictions are some of the most accurate in history.  One of my undergrad physics labs was to measure the wavelength of an electron: it was uncanny how we would work out the predicted wavelength, turn on an electron diffraction globe (this basically shoots electrons through a crystal and then projects the results onto a phosphorence screen - kinda like a TV, but with a diffraction grid instead of a magnetic coil), and watch the rings fall exactly where we predicted.  \r\n\r\nEven when you get up into relativistic QM with the Dirac equation and Quantum Field Theory, you still get testable (and tested) predictions.  It's only the superstring theorists who do pie-in-the-sky math and never ground it in something that could be empirically validated.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809262,"gilded":0,"id":"cvuhk","parent_id":"t1_cvr0m","edited":false,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47278-c407c623-72cb-4ed8-a5c0-b35eb853b8ae-1566236775"}

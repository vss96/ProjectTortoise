Paul is attempting to spread this fact.  He is arguing from a slightly different angle to a slightly different group of people.  And, I think this is a fabulous topic.  Thanks, Paul, for bringing it up.\r\n\r\nVarious people have explained that \"goodness\" is either inherent in the object or is a common subconscious trait in human minds.  I say it is both.\r\n\r\nChristopher Alexander has written many volumes in attempt to prove that there are objective axioms that define when objects and images have \"more life in them\"--that is, when one object is \"better\" than another.  His book \"Nature of Order\" is a must-read.\r\n\r\nJonathan Hale's book \"The Old Way of Seeing\" points out that until around 1830, all people had \"an eye\" for design.  Machines (and maybe public schools) have changed the human perspective.  Now everything is design with symbolic forms and tacked-on style gimmicks (like an eagle over the garage door).  Almost every really old house, built by almost any craftsman, is better than any house built today.  The subtle tweaks to sizes, shapes, and angles are a lost art.  This is the same reason we can no longer paint like the Dutch masters.\r\n\r\nThe myth that \"beuaty is subjective\" is the cloud in front of our eyes that prevents us from rediscovering beauty.\r\n\r\nNow, go and write software that follow the beauty and natural order of things.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_ufsk","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166641530,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41473-cb9c4bb5-13f4-4c37-a71a-73f89b83dcc8-1566236773"}

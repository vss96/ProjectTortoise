Indie labels classically paid artists 50% of profits while majors paid 10-14% of retail (the price the shop pay) on every copy sold regardless of whether a loss was made overall. An indie using the same formula as the majors would have ended up paying about 40% of profit to the artists on a typical small run that sold out (whilst taking 100% of any loss) - so the deals are not miles apart for the artist at the volumes where a profit-share arrangement  might be offered. Artists compete to get on a major label because the higher level of sales volumes and marketing muscle more than compensate for even a majorly reduced cut of income. If the artists were getting ripped off across the board as you suppose, you would hear a lot more stories of artists dropping their labels than vice-versa. The other advantage of the major deal is that the accounting is far more transparent and it is actually far harder to rip off the artist this way (an indie just has to show that they didn't make a profit which is very easy to do). \r\n\r\nRegardless, allofmp3 has a ton of indie content and I don't suppose you only dl major label stuff from there. I know a couple of indie artists who have battled to get their stuff taken off allofmp3 and they consider it a despicable operation that has directly taken money from their pockets.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w7j7","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167449004,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":2,"score":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58080-ed1a57e2-1773-4ed6-92fa-bf542f20a43a-1566236780"}

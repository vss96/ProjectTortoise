A lack of a hard drive in the Wii is going to bite it in the ass when bigger games than bowling come along -- and the load times increase like crazy to compensate.\r\n\r\nFunny that you juxtapose those two statements.  Load time didn't exist in console games until CD-based media came along.  The N64 used cartridges specifically because Nintendo didn't want load times.\r\n\r\nThey moved to optical media for the GameCube because they knew the tech was good enough to avoid loading time by streaming and hiding it in visual transitions.  Nintendo's games don't have load time.\r\n\r\n&gt; If the japanese decide they DO want a gaming appliance that also plays back HD movies, and if so, then the PS3 is the only game in town.\r\n\r\nThe Xbox 360 is selling abysmally in Japan, so the real question is whether they want a system with HDTV output.  With the new Dragon Quest game coming to the DS, signs point to \"maybe.\"","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52102-585be371-e917-43b5-8558-d4b292807250-1566236778"}

But I would disagree that the best language requires popularity. Languages are popular for many reasons besides technical merit. Popularity as a proxy for library support, I can understand, although many people talk about languages in terms of their features, and not their lib support.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vh74","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166659594,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42145-ac1f3dfd-e91f-4029-8a95-e09b8fcde12a-1566236774"}

First the icon itself incorporates graphic  elements of Apple's \"Account's\" pref. pane which have been used since Mac OS X Public Beta, and combines them with standard design elements that all the server apps. share (the platter which iconically suggests a server).  It's very unlikely that those would be found in a stock art collection.  Second Apple has a number of talented graphic designers working for them, and even have people whose job responsibility is to create icons for products.  Finally I IMed someone I know who used to work at Apple on the X Server team and asked her about the icon.  She reported that Apple definitely designed all the icons used for X Server admin tools.","created_utc":1165879369,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":7,"ups":7,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuhzq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ugs5","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808343,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23534-939efd55-377b-4f8a-a41d-35c5f810af08-1566236766"}

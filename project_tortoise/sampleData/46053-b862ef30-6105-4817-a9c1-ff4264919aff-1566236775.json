{"controversiality":0,"body":"This reminds me of the trial of a writer who wrote a book detailing how to carry out a murder without getting caught.  Just as with this video the question was whether his book (that could be used to carry out a real crime) was protected under the freedom of speech.  There may or may not have been an actual murder carried out according to the book that sparked the trial.\r\n\r\nRegrettably I lack any additional detail (but would love some. If you have any idea what I'm talking about please post!) but the cases seem similar.  At least in that this may prove as an interesting case study of just how far freedom of speech stretches.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vqjl","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166818055,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"Eugi","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvs4h","parent_id":"t3_vqjl","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809218,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46053-b862ef30-6105-4817-a9c1-ff4264919aff-1566236775"}

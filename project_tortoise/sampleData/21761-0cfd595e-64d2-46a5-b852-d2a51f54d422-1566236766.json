That's because of something market fundamentalists keep dismissing. The fact that economics is political. And Europeans are all good Keynesians.\r\n\r\nAnother thing the market fundamentalists keep dismissing is that the economy is physically real. Not only is it physically real but it is predicated on the extraction, transformation and consumption of natural resources. Natural resources which are starting to look a lot more zero-sum right now.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when the US economy disappears? Aside from millions of Americans starving, 10 million barrels per day of petrol exports are suddenly liberated from the death-grip of the USA's military. Overnight, the price of oil plunges to record lows. And that's great news for Europe.","controversiality":1,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165821545,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cuekg","parent_id":"t1_cue8v","author":"richardkulisz","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808278,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21761-0cfd595e-64d2-46a5-b852-d2a51f54d422-1566236766"}

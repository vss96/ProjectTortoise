Somehow \"virtue\" is twisted to mean voting Republican, supporting all sorts of things (like torture!) that are immoral on their face, and cutting taxes for the rich while our country sinks in debt! This is \"virtue\", right? Because that's the rest of the story that isn't in your post.\r\n\r\nWhen the self-referentially \"virtuous\" start behaving in ways that are clear immoral and hypocritical, what right remains for them to force their own \"virtue\" down other people's throats?\r\n\r\nYou and your cronies can waste my tax money, you can fight your war for Leo Strauss' ideal of a ruling class, you can control me with your ridiculous laws, but you CANNOT CONTROL MY MIND! And I- and many other people- can see clearly what hypocrisy is, and \"moral\" folks like you say that in one breath and in the next say that ten thousand more dead Iraqis is somehow better than a gad damn gay wedding.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t3v1","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"164-b9899841-e89c-4243-8818-73d5783e1008-1566236758"}

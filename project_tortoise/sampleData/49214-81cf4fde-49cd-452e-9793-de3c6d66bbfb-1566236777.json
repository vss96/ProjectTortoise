Dawkins clearly doesn't know the area he is criticising and either hasn't read or didn't understand St Augustine or Thomas a Kempis for example. His 'argument' here is on the same level that science should be forbidden because it has given us nuclear weapons (in fact it's a lot weaker). For less inane atheist reading matter I would recommend Nietzsche's 'The Antichrist' (bearing in mind that he started going insane from syphilis midway through writing it). Or Douglas Adams at least.","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167007965,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vx8t","id":"cvycj","edited":false,"author":"chu","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809335,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49214-81cf4fde-49cd-452e-9793-de3c6d66bbfb-1566236777"}

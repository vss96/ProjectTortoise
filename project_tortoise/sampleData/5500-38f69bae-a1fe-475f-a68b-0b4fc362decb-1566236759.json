If you recall Cher's last hit, where it was all run through a vocoder, giving it a sort of 'machine' style to it - this was (allegedly, I have no cites on it) a earlier iteration of auto tune.  Back then, they hadn't eliminated the vocoder twang, so they just made it sound deliberate.  However, even today, it's not possible to totally eliminate it.   All you need to do is get it to the point where it's not noticeable.  It's probably (information theory predictions) impossible to totally eliminate this.\r\n\r\nThe other part is that the perfection is a bit telling in and of itself.  This is not quite the same as just being an excellent singer; hence the specific examples I mentioned.  This is also difficult to fake; as the imperfections that are acceptable (i.e. sound good) are not consistant; whereas perfection is.  Give it time, and soon I expect to see auto tune-esque algorithms that allow you to mark emotional points, and apply some imperfection to it.\r\n\r\nSo, that's a brief summary of the limitations.  Do recall that this is a tool that is good enough to fool nearly all of the population who are not looking for it, so it's not easy to spot.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5500-38f69bae-a1fe-475f-a68b-0b4fc362decb-1566236759"}

Its full of good old boys of irish and italian descent who took out mafias.  The gangs are still here albiet much smarter and quieter.  All they learned was to not flaunt their power and have good lawyers on retainer.\r\n\r\nOf course the FBI is probably racist.  Its self preservation.  They need to keep their jobs for as long as possible.  This \"terrorism\" thing has nothing to do with what they know and their backgrounds.  None of them can infiltrate a real terror cell let alone find one.  \r\n\r\nSo they find groups that are peacefully demonstrating or anti war but not violent in any way.  Because they are public and easy to find.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_topy","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165335245,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9139-bed40745-72d3-4299-8284-f169e12656b6-1566236761"}

{"body":"I find it a little curious that you're making that argument. All of those funny things which IDEs do, I usually end up thinking \"Isn't that really a job for the language?\"\r\n\r\nI suppose it doesn't *really* matter, if you consider an IDE to be some sort of extended phenotype of what the language is, but personally, I usually like tools which load very quickly and have unobtrusive user interfaces, which means that I'm not too happy with most of the IDEs out there, and usually prefer a texteditor like vim. I'll use emacs if I'm likely to be hacking on one file for a long time, but I find vim much nicer for quick editing.\r\n\r\nSmalltalk is another matter altogether. I'm completely okay with what it's doing, but that's rather different in nature from what most IDEs aim at. :)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uuzg","subreddit":"programming","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166243715,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"cgibbard","id":"cuzwt","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuvsf","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808678,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32011-7e0bc715-f59e-4e87-aa74-f5c08fd5e93b-1566236770"}

That is, whether health should be classified with public goods such as clean air, water, etc, or with private goods such as furniture or cars. This is much more fundamental than individual costs for health care.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, cosmetic surgery isn't paid for by the government in countries with national health care systems. While I can't speak for all nationalized systems, here in Canada, where medical care is free, you still pay the full costs of cosmetic surgery yourself.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t92a","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807531,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"supajax","edited":false,"id":"ctaqn","parent_id":"t1_cta3f","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2504-234407ec-ded1-4d07-ac1c-021cd1c38d91-1566236758"}

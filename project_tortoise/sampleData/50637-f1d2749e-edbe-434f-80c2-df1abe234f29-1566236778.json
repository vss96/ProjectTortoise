{"body":"I like that argument too. I'll even just wholy take that argument even though my own preference is ASP/VBScript - *without* the .NET crap.\r\n\r\n VB originally was created as a glue language between COM objects. VBScript has shortcomings as a language, but ultimately it can access pretty much any ole automated COM object. And there's quite a bunch of them.\r\n And if you want really custom functionality, tying in a C++ project into your ASP app is extremely easy precisely because of this glueness. Using standard objects that come with every IIS system nowadays, you can easily access CLI utility tools and even use their output.\r\n\r\n Same arguments as @celoyd apply here: I know its warts, practically any error I ever encounter these days has at least 10 hits on google, and it has a good documentation and community. So what if it's not open source: I don't ever want to modify the implementation of the language.\r\n\r\n Another thing that's similar to what @celoyd says: \"I have trouble trusting the design of any framework that isnâ€™t portable\". That's why I abhore .NET: ASP/plain VBS works on any windows system. It actually even works on Apache on linux boxes (although I've never bothered trying). Web development is ultimately nothing but string manipulations. You manipulate strings and send out a string buffer.\r\n You shouldn't need a framework of object oriented libraries to do that.\r\n\r\n And last but not least: I'm actually glad that .NET came to be. The reason is because .NET is nothing but marketing. Many a framework is (e.g. J2EE). It's a way for Microsoft marketing guys to be able to scream out \"we're the best, buy us\". The cool thing is that it's so displaced their attention that they have basically frozen VBScript as it is. Which means that's it's finally become standardized. Microsoft doesn't even try to \"embrace and extend VBS\" because they think it's obsolete. \r\n And that is my dream come true of any system: it's stable and it works. Bug fixes, sure. But nobody is trying to reinvent sliced bread when it comes to VBS.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w0ju","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167107936,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cw136","parent_id":"t1_cw0m3","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809388,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50637-f1d2749e-edbe-434f-80c2-df1abe234f29-1566236778"}

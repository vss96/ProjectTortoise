Roll a single die and you have exactly a 1 in 6 chance of a particular result.\r\n\r\nNow roll both dice and the result is no longer random but is based on complete randomness. The probabilities are no longer equal.\r\n\r\n    2 = 1/36\r\n    3 = 2/36 = 1/18\r\n    7 = 6/36 = 1/6\r\n    10 = 3/36 =1/12\r\n\r\nSo now there's a greater probability of one particular result instead of another, it's no longer random except all you're doing is rolling two completely random dice instead of one. Non randomness out of randomness; order out of chaos.\r\n\r\nAll natural selection requires is that out of all of the random mutations, one of them makes you more likely than everyone else to breed successfully. From then on evolution is inevitable.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48903-a9c44657-e39b-4d97-9d1c-c66cd1673fd5-1566236777"}

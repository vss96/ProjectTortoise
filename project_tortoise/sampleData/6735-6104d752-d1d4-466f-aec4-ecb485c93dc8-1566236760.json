There is no 'emergent process' at work, there is only miserable, ignorant poverty. What Chavez's government is trying to do is allow the children of those poor a way out of the trap by providing a free education and basic health services. It's not simply a morally just way to invest the natural resources of the country but it's a grand social experiment in modern nation building, which, if it works, will pay dividends for that region of the world long after Chavez is dead and gone.","link_id":"t3_tic8","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807712,"distinguished":null,"author":"borg","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctkc9","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctk69","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6735-6104d752-d1d4-466f-aec4-ecb485c93dc8-1566236760"}

If we assume their electric system is ruuning around 400V, and the battery pack holds 30-40KWH, the 10 minute charge is going to run about 500 Amps DC, or 1000 Amps at 220VAC.  You're going to need some very fat cables, a very high power charger, and you'll have to rewire your home for industrial power.\r\n\r\nTesla has talked about why they don't try to charge faster -- there are the problems of managing high current over ordinary house wiring, and extending the life of the battery pack under such severe strains.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52514-ab91f170-537f-4aa9-82cb-7774c64c9e7a-1566236778"}

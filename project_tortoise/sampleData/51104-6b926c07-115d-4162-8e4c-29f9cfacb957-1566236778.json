I mean, say I need to pay somebody some money and they don't happen to have one of those point-of-sale card swipe things (I can't whip out my debit card to pay them). All I have to do is take out this little slip of paper (the check), put their name on it, fill in the date and amount to pay and sign it. Done. In contrast, if I wanted to pay by EFT, I would first need to get their bank info and then... uh... go somewhere else and... uh... well, never mind, of course it could be done, and once you did it a few times it would be very easy, but nothing like simply writing the person a check.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167142094,"ups":5,"score":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51104-6b926c07-115d-4162-8e4c-29f9cfacb957-1566236778"}

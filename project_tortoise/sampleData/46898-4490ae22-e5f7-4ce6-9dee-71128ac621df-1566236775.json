It doesn't give you everything that other languages do, but it also has less cruft than C++.\r\n\r\nWhen NeXT OS was being made, cool languages like Smalltalk were just waaay too slow.  You want some OO features, but going whole hog with a VM just eats too many cycles.  So, put a light coat of paint on C and voila.\r\n\r\nC++ got most of the mindshare probably because of Microsoft.  These days, if you want full sugar you can use Lisp or Smalltalk or Ruby or Python and just call into C when needed (for straightforward number crunching).\r\n\r\nObjective C is more popular now than ever thanks to OS X.  It's a perfectly good language, it's just in-between C and a more handholding dialect like C#.","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1166853915,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cvtly","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vs9v","author":"lemmikins","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809247,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46898-4490ae22-e5f7-4ce6-9dee-71128ac621df-1566236775"}

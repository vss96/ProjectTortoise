My point is, no parent starts off wanting their children to blame everyone else but themselves.  It just turns into that if we are not careful.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the line is so fine as to be indistinguishable from raising kids with high self-esteem.\r\n\r\nI swear, I often wonder how, in a world full of Britney Spears wannabe little girls, how black parents are somehow expected to overcome the same kind of self-esteem problem.  We don't blame parents for their anorexic children, we blame the whole of society, don't we?\r\n\r\nI have not once seen anorexia described to a group and had the grown people say \"blame the parents.\"\r\n\r\nI see black children with low self-esteem the same way.  We as a society are to blame, not simply bad parenting.  \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w367","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1167277776,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54296-387e220e-ca78-4754-b161-083d4df2dbfd-1566236779"}

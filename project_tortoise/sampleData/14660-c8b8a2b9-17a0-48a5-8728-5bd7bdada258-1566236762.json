And since back then, you weren't married in the eyes of 'god' unless you consumated the marriage (i.e. FUCKED) a lot of 'kids' were having sex. \r\n\r\nTo simply put it, go back 300 (or 500) years, and what you're looking at is a societal norm. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what do you do about? Education. They were obviously physically ready, or the girl would not have gotten pregnant. She was ovulating, and he wasn't shooting blanks. They've physically transformed into adults, maybe its time we started treating them like, so they emotionally transition into adults.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying I approve of the situation, or even how I'd react as a parent if this happened to my child (not a parent, so can't speak to that). All I'm saying is this idea that '12 and 13' year olds are 'innocent children' is a MYTH. I'm 25. I can think of 3 different couples that were sexually active as early as 4th grade.  That's six people I grew up with that lost their virginity at 11. I'm not saying its morally right, but to criminalize these 'innocent children' isn't the way to go about it.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14660-c8b8a2b9-17a0-48a5-8728-5bd7bdada258-1566236762"}

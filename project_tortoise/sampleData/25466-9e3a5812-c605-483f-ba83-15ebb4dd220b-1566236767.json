And when registering to get an account, they used a CAPTCHA -- but with Chinese characters! It was *awful*. I'm just a student of Chinese so I have a hard enough time with it as it is, but then when they start throwing random little dots and strokes around it gets darn near impossible for me. Yikes!\r\n\r\nAlso, I really like http://www.ridiculousfish.com 's captcha system. In it you're just asked to mash number keys for a while and input two huge random numbers. It's a good spam prevention measure, as long as it's not used on a large scale, and there's the added benefit that he's using the numbers input to calculate pi! You'll have to check out the site to see how. Fascinating stuff.","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25466-9e3a5812-c605-483f-ba83-15ebb4dd220b-1566236767"}

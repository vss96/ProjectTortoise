{"body":"I can understand where bluetrust is coming from because this is exactly what I originally thought when I was evaluating Haskell -- having XHTML in Haskell is really going to muddle up my code.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it's startlingly elegant. And the web framework I'm writing actually uses Model/View/Controller to keep things pretty clean.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick example with some real Haskell code:\r\n\r\nhtmlTemplate title content =\r\n  h1 &lt;&lt; title +++\r\n  p &lt;&lt; content\r\n \r\nhtmlPage =\r\n  htmlTemplate \"Your Page Title\" \"Your content\"\r\n\r\nIf you render htmlPage you get:\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Your Page Title&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your content&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nThis is really a toy example, and really doesn't do justice to how great Haskell XHTML generation really is, but it does give some idea as to how XHTML generation in Haskell works. You really start seeing much greater returns when you get to 1000+ LOC of XHTML.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0ju","subreddit":"programming","score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1167103897,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"ss498","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cw0vj","id":"cw0xw","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809385,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50538-73e58b07-aa6b-40fa-a534-2ea8f6502ef9-1566236778"}

I haev checked your blog and it has nothing to do with [edited], so I think it would be best all round if you remove your blog from google for this search term.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that we make our living from this, and you are just writing a blog that has nothing to do with [edited].\r\n\r\nIf you do not remove yourself from google for this search, then I will call them myself and have you removed.\r\n\r\nI expect a reply soon.\r\n\r\nThankyou.\r\n\r\n[edited]\r\n[edited].com\r\n\r\nFrom: xxxxx xxxxxxxxx\r\nDate: 12/8/2006 xx:xx:xx PM\r\nTo: [edited]\r\nSubject: Re: DeanHunt.com Google Removal Request\r\n\r\n[edited],\r\n\r\nDean here from DeanHunt.com\r\n\r\nI just received your e-mail. My first question would have to be… Are you serious?\r\n\r\nI had to re-read your e-mail three times to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me!\r\n\r\nHere is some more info that may help you understand my stance on this:\r\n\r\na) I have never attempted to rank for the search term [edited], I seem to rank fairly well for [edited], which I suppose is fairly similar. But if Google prefers my site to yours then perhaps you should be asking yourself why that is.\r\n\r\nb) There is nothing I can do about removing myself for that search term, nor am I going to attempt to do anything. I have no information on my site related to [edited], so I am sure that the searchers will generally visit your site instead.\r\n\r\nc) You can contact Google if you wish! I doubt you will get a serious reply though.\r\n\r\nPerhaps instead of wasting your time with e-mails like this you could work on improving your web site instead?\r\n\r\nAnyway, good luck with contacting google, if you do get a reply, I would love a copy of their e-mail. I have prepared a nice little place on my wall to hang it from.\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\n\r\nDean","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1165696273,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18968-3955095f-faef-46c8-b6c2-5dfe4e46f5ca-1566236764"}

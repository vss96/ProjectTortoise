Most are pulling down 15k or so a year (beer and pizza money at least).  Also the only one of my high school friends who didn't qualify for at least 4 grand a year in free money through grants and scholarships did so by never bothering to apply (His father was pulling down 500k a year at the time running his own engineering firm).\r\n\r\nThe people who lose out on time/money spent in college are the ones who \"get through\" every class with minimum interest/effort spent for the purposes of getting a diploma.  And as even the article's author pointed out, they still end up earning comprible bucks to their high school diploma carrying peers in the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165623758,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cu59z","edited":false,"id":"cu6q1","author":"thevalarauk","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808130,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17424-c252cf41-c241-43be-bf2f-049ad027a026-1566236763"}

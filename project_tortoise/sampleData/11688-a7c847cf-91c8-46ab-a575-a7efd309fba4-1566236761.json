{"subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165422744,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"controversiality":0,"body":"There was an article posted on reddit recently (unfortunately I didn't save it) about how teens use more reason in their decision making process than adults. Meaning when adults make decisions, their mind instantly returns drugs = bad. Teenagers weigh the pros and cons and decide whether or not they want to take the risk.\r\n\r\nI think that this explains the whole \"gateway drug\" theory. Naturally, the most frequently abused drug among teens is alcohol. Marijuana is riskier from a legal standpoint, but the majority of teens know that it's not going to do them any real harm. Next in line is probably cocaine, which is where the line between reckless and curious is really defined. Most teens are smart enough to stay away from it after their reasoning process.\r\n\r\nI don't think that alcohol -&gt; marijuana -&gt; cocaine is a progression, but rather a product of teens having different levels of risk tolerance. A teen that's willing to risk a heart attack to get high will try cocaine, but for this to happen they have to by chance fall into the smaller crowd of teens that do use cocaine. The numbers will tell you that it will undoubtedly take more time for this to happen, so it makes perfect sense that they fall in with crowds that experiment with alcohol and marijuana first.\r\n\r\nIf anyone remembers or finds that article, I think it would be very interesting to reread while considering the gateway drug theory.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tsik","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807904,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dannyhw","edited":false,"id":"ctung","parent_id":"t3_tsik","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11688-a7c847cf-91c8-46ab-a575-a7efd309fba4-1566236761"}

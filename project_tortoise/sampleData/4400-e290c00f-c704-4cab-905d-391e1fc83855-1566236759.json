Ever.  I could be mistaken on this though.\r\n\r\nThe wii has never, and will never, be in the same league.  Nintendo saw two giants fighting a battle and decided to do something different.  It's like trying to compare a hummer and a jeep to a vw bug.  It's simply different. \r\n\r\nI've bitten Nintendo's magic apple and I'm fully taken in.  Graphics and raw cpu power don't matter.  The DS is deeply gutless and does just fine.  The games I spend most of my time on were made a decade ago.  It's all about the gameplay and not a lick about the graphics.\r\n\r\nMore power would be useful, but from an interview I heard with the designer their biggest goals were power consumption, efficency, and size.  The wii is more powerful than the old xbox, but not by much.  And if you look at the technical improvements they did focus on, they blow the competition away.\r\n\r\nIf Nintendo were to take away the profit they make on selling these things, I'd much rather they throw in a second controller than any more guts.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tdyf","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165117440,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":10,"ups":10,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4400-e290c00f-c704-4cab-905d-391e1fc83855-1566236759"}

Of course it is.\r\n\r\nThat's the opening line of Ken Miller's article that I post. Ken Miller literally wrote the book that these stickers were being placed on. If you don't know about Ken Miller, you should watch how he [systematically destroys the argument for ID](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRsWAjvQSg) in a calm convincing 2 hour lecture.

Here are my armchair statistics: If you ask people in the U.S. \"What do you think about evolution\", 80% will think you're asking whether man evolved from apes or not, not whether biological evolution exists.\r\n\r\nAnd if you really want to split hairs, the sticker says that \"evolution is a theory (not a fact) *regarding the origin of living things*\". The text, as stated, *in its full context*, is true.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vsz3","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809296,"author":"carpeliam","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvw69","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvuwj","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48131-e7178547-2de4-4f29-9f2c-649038f1a6aa-1566236777"}

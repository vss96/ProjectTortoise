So then you might say, \"red is a photon of a certain wave length.\" Similarly, if you talk about \"a red object,\" you can do so in terms of either its effect on humans or the surface chemistry's effect on photons. \r\n\r\nNow, when you talk about beauty, you could say, \"anything that meets a certain mathematical definition is beautiful\" then build a LISP program that takes in and image then spits out a percentage to indicate how beautiful the image is. That would be a fully objective standard of beauty (and also probably a very arbitrary one). However, if you bring in people as the arbiters of beauty, that's a little different. It can be Kant-style objective, because for Kant, objective just means, \"perceived like this by anyone.\" But you can't call that realist-objective, because for realists, objective means \"'out there' in space, whether anyone perceives it or not.\" \r\n\r\nI guess what you're getting at is that it's objective fact (\"out there\") that humans respond in a certain way to certain artifacts. However, you say at the same time that people need to be trained to filter out tricks and whatnot. But how do we know what's a trick and what's fair, if it's objective fact that a lot of people respond to paintings with tricks in them? The difficulty of your theory as it stands now is that its not clear why certain human responses count as proof of beauty, but others don't. A red photon is a red photon, but beauty is in the eyes of the beholders unless they're being tricked?","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165955722,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":2,"score":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25567-36ff90fc-7904-4711-945b-54fa07e4be4e-1566236767"}

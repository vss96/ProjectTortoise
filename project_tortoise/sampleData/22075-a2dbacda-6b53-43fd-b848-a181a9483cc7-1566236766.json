A lower-bound analysis can use a \"triple\" branch tree, although most implementations only use triple branches for some of the trials.  \r\n    \r\nIn this case we have 13 balls, so the lower bound would be three weighings.  \r\n    \r\nDon't think I'm one of THOSE...this was just covered in my Discrete Math class...  \r\n     \r\nOh and \"minimum\" is a terrible misuse of English.

All you have to do is either get elected, in which case you have plenty of power to sell, or you can just buy it.  The worst part is that when a corporation lobbies for harmful regulation, the damage is usually diffuse, and so the people and businesses harmed would have to expend a lot of money to prevent a little loss.  This means that the harmful regulation usually goes unchallenged.\r\n\r\nFor example, when farm corporations lobby for tariffs, they are getting a huge benefit.  But the increased cost to any consumer is probably less than $200 a year.  Obviously, anyone willing to spend the time and effort to combat such a tariff would have to be *extremely* dedicated and motivated, not to mention having plenty of money to burn.  Usually, it's just not worth it to anyone.  \r\n\r\nSo that's what things are like right now.  Public Choice theory is the study of this situation.\r\n\r\nBack to how anarcho-capitalism can prevent this: let's imagine that you are a big farm corporation trying to stifle competition.  Let's say you want to do the same thing -- tax imports so that you can sell at artificially higher prices.\r\n\r\nWell, the first step is that you'll have to find some way of collecting those taxes.  The IRS doesn't exist, so that cost falls on you.  Let's also go easy and say that there is only one company (because it's really good) providing security at all the ports in the continental US.  You have to convince them to give you the data on who is importing food so you can tax it.  Also, you need some way of enforcing your tax, because people are not going to just accept a new tax without a fight.  So you pay for your own little army as well.\r\n\r\nThe amount of money you'd have to spend on this is far more than you're likely to get from the tax.  Why not go all the way and outlaw competition altogether?  Well, this has it's own problems.  Now you need a much bigger force to shut down or take over farms all over the place.  Crap.\r\n\r\nOk, maybe it's best to convince a bunch of other farm companies to price-gouge with you.  Unfortunately, nothing is stopping anyone from undercutting you.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe combine the army to outlaw competition along with the collusion with other farmers.  You can all split the cost of the army...hey wait!  This farm won't cooperate.  Ok, let's use the army against him.  Oh, crap, everyone is supporting the resistance because they don't want us to control all the food and make it more expensive.  Oh, and while our company was scheming, a startup developed new technology that allows them to grow produce for 20% less.  Now we can't even pay our soldiers.\r\n\r\nNow, I am not arguing that anarcho-capitalism makes it impossible for some evil-minded person or organization to take over -- far from it.  But it makes it much harder, because that person essentially has to bootstrap his own government monopoly before he can reap any benefit.  When the government exists, you're 90% there already, and so obviously the power is going to be used for personal gain and public harm.  Lawmakers don't even usually have evil thoughts in mind.  It's just that it's much easier for them to believe that protectionism is a good thing, and that the government is doing a better job than the free market would, than to live in a state of contradiction and hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nWhen you're starting from anarchy, such gain and abuse of power would be the exception rather than the rule.  It would be harder to create a government out of anarchy than it is to take over an existing government, because you're working against the tide.  And it's all because people act in their own self-interest.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165821891,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuel0","parent_id":"t1_cudyn","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"asokoloski","retrieved_on":1473808278,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21770-73a12435-ae8e-45ce-ab30-e6a75634162a-1566236766"}

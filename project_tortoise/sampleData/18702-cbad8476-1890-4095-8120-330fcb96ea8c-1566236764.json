He seems to be saying she's not really a black person because she was sheltered against racists like Bull Conner.\r\n\r\nDoes Robinson think Rice is a stupid person? Anyone who thinks \"Condi\" isn't able to access the situation at hand is more likely the one to be proven wrong.\r\n\r\nThere *IS* a very profound difference here, Rice has chosen to pursue her dreams instead of focusing on Bull Conner who died about 50 years ago. And Robinson cherishes the memory of WASP racial prejudice.\r\n\r\nRobinson is blind to the racial prejudice of blacks in today's society -- or excuses it because \"we were oppressed for 200 years.\" All of life's disappointments and sorrows can be vastly improved by saying \"it's only because we're black.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson and others should look at other ethnic groups here in this country. If you truly want to fit in and become a part of this country, remember that what happened in the past is history. Take a tip from Condoleezza and don't dwell on things that happened back then. Life is short. Too short to spend it feeling sorry for yourself because of unfairness or the racism of a few (it's not restricted to whites or blacks). Make the most of your life and be as happy as you are able. (unless beating the racism drum is what makes you happy).\r\n\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u905","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165686954,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18702-cbad8476-1890-4095-8120-330fcb96ea8c-1566236764"}

I think the people who think this would lead to nobody getting married are missing the point. You don't have to agree on everything--the point is to make sure there are as few surprises as possible and make sure you can communicate well. If you learn to talk about important issues before you get married you're much more likely to be able to settle future issues amicably.\r\n\r\nIt's also really helpful to have a good counselor to discuss these issues with. My wife and I were required to answer a similar questionnaire before our marriage in my wife's Catholic church. Coming from different backgrounds our answers were quite different and the original Priest doing our counseling discouraged us from marriage. A better Priest actually worked with us and we discovered we weren't as different as we thought--in lots of cases we were just interpreting the questions differently. \r\n\r\nThe important thing was we learned to identify and resolve conflict early--without that I don't think our marriage would have lasted.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808873,"gilded":0,"id":"cva7n","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv9jd","author":"EtherGnat","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37055-8203a671-565b-47d9-bc84-26b47a642ed9-1566236772"}

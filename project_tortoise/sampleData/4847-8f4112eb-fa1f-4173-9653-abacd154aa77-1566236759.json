The mere notion of \"playing\" at being either a convict or a prison guard (or a cop, soldier or any other kind of violent authority figure) is enough to make me sick to my stomach. I've never fallen prey to groupthink or situational ethics in my life and I'm not likely to start because someone tells me to.\r\n\r\nMilgram's experiment may have been striking but scientifically it was complete bullshit since he pre-selected all of his subjects on the basis of obedience. Every single one of his subjects had to consent (obey) Milgram to even take part in the experiment.

What percentage of those with such a history end up identifying as homosexuals? Is that percentage higher than it is in general?\r\n\r\nI think it is, in a statistically significant way, but then \"statistically significant\" can mean as little as just a few percentage points. OSC wants to imply that 90% or more of homosexuals were \"indoctrinated\" for lack of a better word, but that's just absolute bullshit.\r\n\r\nIt's also slightly moot for his argument, if not detrimental. Even if he is correct, he can't be claiming that 100% are like that, and for any percentage less than 100, he's saying at least a few are created by what is a completely natual phenomenon. Those few deserve our sympathy even more, and probably have a greater claim to marriage than they would otherwise, since they are not preventable no matter how society might try to clean up its act.","retrieved_on":1473809203,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cvr1i","edited":false,"id":"cvrbd","author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45624-124301d0-7890-42aa-9cce-8f9b9d29e4bf-1566236775"}

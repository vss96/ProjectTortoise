If people ask me, how is X, and I don't like it, I will say usually say something like, \"that's ok, but for my money Y is always delicious,\"  and sometimes I will go so far as to say \"don't get that, its not that good,\"  I really recommend my favorites, not the most expensive.  Guess what, you get WAY better tips when you are totally honest like this.  People know you are genuinely concerned with their experience, and not just your money.  You also begin to develop a slew of regulars that appreciate your honest and thoughtful service.  Obviously you have either never waited tables, or never learned to do it well.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tn2q","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807809,"author":"limukala","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctpl7","parent_id":"t1_ctnpx","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9163-1ae042aa-a005-4424-a0c2-964eac6d6eaf-1566236761"}

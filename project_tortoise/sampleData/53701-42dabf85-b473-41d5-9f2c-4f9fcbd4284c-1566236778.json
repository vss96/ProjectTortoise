Usually, it's something like \"because of industry support, portability, Java IDEs, etc.\" or \"I can't explain it, you have to learn Java and find out\".\r\n\r\nI've spent a little time learning Java so far, and have a general idea of how the language works, but I can't see why it's so great. If I write OOP code in it, it always turns out to be more concise in Smalltalk or Ruby, and other times, it's just plain old procedural C-style code.\r\n\r\nI've seen many Redditors praise Java, so I figured you could explain it: what makes Java so great? And instead of just saying \"industry support, portability\", could you explain what those things mean, and why they are so useful in programming? If it's such a long explanation that it can't be done justice here, can you point me to somewhere that does explain it?\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167253138,"ups":2,"score":2,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53701-42dabf85-b473-41d5-9f2c-4f9fcbd4284c-1566236778"}

He boasted that he was being seen by the top professor in his field at the top hospital for his kind of problem. Now of course that was an NHS hospital and the prof an NHS consultant. I did try to explain to him that the quality of private healthcare in the UK was the same or worse than the NHS (I have a doctor and health admin in my family and know that private health is nearly always done by NHS staff in NHS hospitals or more rarely in private clinics with laxer hiring standards). The only reason he could give for spending most of his life savings on what he had effectively already paid for via tax, was that he believed it enabled him to jump the queue (it did to some extent but I think he had an exaggerated idea of by how much) and gave him peace of mind.","ups":3,"score":3,"created_utc":1166238730,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuzq1","parent_id":"t1_cuz67","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"chu","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808674,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31920-dffd6e20-f9f7-450b-ba49-80c872dedcb4-1566236770"}

I have been a huge fan of Iggy Pop since the mid-70's. Seen and heard his ups and downs at concerts and on albums. But these past few years he has been reunited with the Ashton brothers, the great [Mike Watt](http://www.hootpage.com/) and returned to the live circuit as the Stooges.\r\n\r\nI've been anticipating this album. So hopefully they will be  touring the states this new year. He has never disappointed  me at his live shows. Only that overseas he is like Elvis where in the states he is considered just an early fixture in alternative or punk rock. [He's always been much more than that \r\n](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0ISRw59F4w).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w91k","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809541,"author":"artman","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw955","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w91k","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54924-d170ef57-7dc1-4cbe-8896-e855ad414a3f-1566236779"}

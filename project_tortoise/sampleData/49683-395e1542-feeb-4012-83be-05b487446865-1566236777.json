{"body":"All those experiments are flawed by the assumptions that people are good by nature. When the researchers don't understand why people have fun in violent sports for example they are in the wrong field.\r\n\"Why do some people participate in such activities even though it is against their nature?\" That's exactly the point, it isn't against their nature. We're by nature violent, some to more, some to lesser extend. This is fiction, but the concept of \"Fight Club\" is real. People with a swallen eye, bleeding from there nose after a fight saying that they had so much fun. You can't get good results when you're starting with false assumptions.\r\nAnd don't forget the person who gives the orders/the motivation behind those acts. Are all torturers just sadistic or do they think they could extract important information? It seems to me that in America for example the majority of people support the methods employed in questioning \"enemy combatants\". When the government says it isn't torture it isn't, right? And you get vital information, right?","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx7j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167047202,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"hal22","edited":false,"id":"cvz88","parent_id":"t3_vx7j","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809353,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49683-395e1542-feeb-4012-83be-05b487446865-1566236777"}

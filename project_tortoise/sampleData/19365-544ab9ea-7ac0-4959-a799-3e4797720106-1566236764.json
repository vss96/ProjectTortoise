{"body":"That boy, Levi is a \"Child Pastor\"\r\n\r\n&gt; Levi, who has ambitions of being a pastor, has already preached several sermons at his suburban Kansas City church. Early in the film, he is watching a cartoon that preaches that Earth is 6,000 years old. He is homeschooled, and learns physical science from a book that attempts to reconcile the creationist account with scientific principles. He preaches a sermon at the camp in which he declares that his generation is a key to Jesus coming back.\r\n\r\nIf it wasn't for the \"Business of Religion\", that boy would be serving me french fries in 10 years.. \r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n(Edit:) Quoted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Camp\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ua04","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1165713241,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rocky_m","edited":false,"id":"cua8u","parent_id":"t1_cua7w","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808197,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19365-544ab9ea-7ac0-4959-a799-3e4797720106-1566236764"}

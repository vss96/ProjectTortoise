Now if we could just make it a household name in the USA and also get it sold in stores (along with a book for newbies) like BestBuy, CompUSA, Wal*Mart, and Office Depot.\r\n\r\nI now have my whole family on Ubuntu, and my daughter even synchronizes her iPod with it. I've shown them all cool things you can do with Linux that you can't do with Windows. Also, my wife does all her bills and shopping on it and the kids do their homework on it. Plus, my network is like Fort Knox with the routing, two firewalls, and free virus scanner. I refuse to permit Windows on my home network anymore.

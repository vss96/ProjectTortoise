I'd call that a failure, time to try something else.\r\n\r\nYou say that China won't be a democracy any time soon.  I'm more of an optimist... I think once people start to get more money, and get a taste of freedom (economic, at least), that they'll want more.  Thinking about politics is easier if you're not worried about where your next meal comes from.  Perhaps that will take some time with China, but with a smaller country like Cuba it would have happened much more quickly.  Imagine hordes of american tourists, mcdonalds, nike, malls... Castro wouldn't stand a chance;-)\r\n\r\nIn other words, I think freedom is a winner, but it's hard to impose it on people.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ti9j","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165266027,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7466-3ab0cd23-7550-4782-99ba-6e511a637e90-1566236760"}

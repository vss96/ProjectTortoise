Its slow performance isn't an issue to me -- that's not because I'm biased in favor of the language, but just because it's fast enough for what I want to use it for. I'm not doing real-time stuff with it or anything. (But I did try once! Foolishly.) So while I could make my software blindingly fast if I wrote in, say, C, it wouldn't be worth it to me.\r\n\r\nDifferent tools for different tasks.

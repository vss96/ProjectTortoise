Reading a piece of code and having certain elements as placeholders is something that is immediately apparent and intuitive. It is much less intuitive to see an element or variable on a page of code and while reading the program to have to visualize that as refering to an address in memory.\r\n\r\nOne is something that you learn in elementary school math and can be read off the page, the other is something you have to reconcile in your head. I know that in several of my programming classes, quite a few students have had a difficult time grasping references.\r\n\r\nReally when you get down to it, functional programming as a whole is a ton simpler than imperative and/or OO approaches. I think functional programming would be a lot easier for someone never exposed to programming to pick up, and the only reason it is hard for most programmers to understand is because we have trained our brain into thinking a certain way.","controversiality":0,"score":16,"ups":16,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165730479,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19742-ec215a5d-1e9a-4411-9169-7b10b1497dd8-1566236764"}

Do you really believe that the part you took is the essence? May be this is an essence:\r\n&gt;If there is one issue that Israelis agree on, it is that Barak broke every conceivable taboo and went as far as any Israeli prime minister had gone or could go. Coming into office on a pledge to retain Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal and undivided capital,\" he ended up appearing to agree to Palestinian sovereigntyâ€”first over some, then over all, of the Arab sectors of East Jerusalem. Originally adamant in rejecting the argument that Israel should swap some of the occupied West Bank territory for land within its 1967 borders, he finally came around to that view. After initially speaking of a Palestinian state covering roughly 80 percent of the West Bank, he gradually moved up to the low 90s before acquiescing to the mid-90s range.\r\n\r\nor may be this:\r\n&gt; Arafat spent far less time worrying about the substance of a deal than he did fretting about a possible ploy. Fixated on potential traps, he could not see potential opportunities. He never quite realized how far the prime minister was prepared to go, how much the US was prepared to push, how strong a hand he had been dealt. Having spent a decade building a relationship with Washington, he proved incapable of using it when he needed it most.\r\n\r\nSAME ARTICLE.. Shame on you. At least have a bit of integrity to read and analyze text and not to take out of context the only sentence suitable for you...\r\nwhat will you say now? BTW all text is taken from the same article:  http://www.nybooks.com/articles/14380\r\n\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808127,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu6j0","parent_id":"t1_cu2f2","author_flair_text":null,"author":"marglexx","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17299-654d9baf-2b4f-49b9-af1a-b2f423722757-1566236763"}

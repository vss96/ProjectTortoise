The \"ticking time-bomb\" is a _metaphor_ for any imminent attack that could potentially be thwarted- be it by rerouting a plane, canceling a flight, shutting down a dock, evacuating a stadium, stopping subway trains-whatever.  It doesn't need to involve a ticking bomb.  Terrorist attacks are carefully planned over long periods of time, and we do from time to time catch suspects who are aware of them.  There have been several in the past year- the bombing of the PATH subway in New York/New Jersey is one example.  Imagine if we hadn't caught them until they were further along in their plans.  Don't you think it's possible we could have known of a plot without knowing where exactly and/or when exactly and/or by whom exactly it would have occurred?\r\n\r\nRules are important, yes, and they are possibly the only means we have to hem in authority.  A rule against torturing by law enforcement is a good idea exactly to avoid the scenario you painted of a suspect at an OTB being needlessly and unjustly harmed.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm all for establishing a rule against torture.  But, if someone were genuinely in a \"ticking time-bomb\" type of situation where torture was likely to work, I would hope he/she would torture.  It's a shaky moral ground, yes, but so is the alternative.  \r\n\r\nRead my comment more carefully.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166509454,"score":-5,"ups":-5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37703-1330e4f5-a3b8-474e-b30c-404e6ab9f789-1566236772"}

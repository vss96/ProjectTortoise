Writing a generic solution for 'max' simply has to many disadvantages compared to some simple overloaded methods. And we can also easily combine them for example to max(max(t, w), max(x, y, z)). Abstractions are good, but everything good can be turned into something laughable by exaggerating it.\r\n\r\nSure, the Haskell solution for max looks better, but it also requires the creation of a list of values. But if we look at the original example it's different: It's a special case of a standard graph-visitor - which is useful in many cases. And a general solution won't have a big overhead, because the map-insertion is expensive enough. And the Haskell solution also have such abstractions, think of nub and listify.\r\n\r\nBut even your solution isn't as bad as the blog author probably had expected. It looks a big ugly, but the main reason for this is jjTree.\r\n","link_id":"t3_uzuc","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808731,"distinguished":null,"author":"kawa","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cv2eh","id":"cv2nm","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33189-c5be651f-08cc-4524-8d3c-b4c4ca8e7686-1566236770"}

I thought the satellite would be in the middle of two ends of cable.\r\n\r\nOne end going down to Earth, and one end strung out to space.  This is the classic space elevator design concept anyway.\r\n\r\nI still don't believe that a rigid structure is implied.  First off, the cable itself isn't rigid.  The only thing between the middle satellite and the ground is the cable itself and any elevators connected to it.\r\n\r\nI pointed out in another thread on this that the video seemed confused though, so we're in agreement on that.  My point was that the concept video was written poorly, since any ascending elevator is obviously going to prevent a descending elevator.\r\n\r\nObviously if they can't get that part right in designing the video, why would they bother with more serious concerns?","retrieved_on":1473809439,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw3u6","parent_id":"t1_cw3kc","author_flair_text":null,"author":"nosoupforyou","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52091-8c2a6d80-acff-4933-8013-94d2b595f4a6-1566236778"}

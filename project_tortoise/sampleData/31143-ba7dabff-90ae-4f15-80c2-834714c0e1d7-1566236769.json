Compare it to programming...no matter how good MS paid, there is no way they could replace all their current programmers with superstars.  There just aren't enough to go around, and the problem is far greater in the way of public schools.  On top of that, even if they did hire all the superstars in the world, WinXP would still have bugs, zero-day exploits would still be found, etc, because 1) Nobody's perfect, and 2) In order for all the superstar programmers in the world to work together to hammer out a project like WinXP (including DirectX 10, MS-Office, IE7, etc.) in anything approaching an economically feasible period of time, they would have to work outrageous hours and use every minute of their time effectively, or settle for crappy code.  Besides which, all that salary has to come from somewhere...nobody would want MS software because the price would be (drastically more) insane.\r\n\r\nIf we only allowed awesome teachers to teach, even if we jacked the pay up to \"six figures\", the Teacher/Student ratio would probably be 3 or maybe 4 digits long on the student side.  All it would take in a situation like that are 2 or 3 assholes who really don't want to learn and a few dozen apathetic kids who will just go along with whatever seems most entertaining and *bam*, instant anarchy.  It's just not feasible.  If we can't fix the teachers (and we can't), maybe we should try to fix the system (we can, and it's the real root of the problem anyways.)","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166209784,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuu7i","id":"cuy2u","author_flair_text":null,"author":"oditogre","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808644,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31143-ba7dabff-90ae-4f15-80c2-834714c0e1d7-1566236769"}

I hope you did too.\r\n\r\na) As I said before, rather than yet another Machiavellian scheme to subdue the masses (or maintain power), there is also the possibility that the US administration believe that they are truly fighting a just and moral cause against vice and drug abuse: saving people (read: potential addicts) from themselves. I personally subscribe to a far more liberal view regarding such things, yet I still understand that there are rational moral arguments behind their actions. This is the crux here: their belief in the removal of illicit substances from the US is their central aim. Their central aim is not to simply put more police in your lives and on your streets, and find some drug-related excuse to do so. *They believe in what they are doing*. On another note, the DEA are not deployed equitably across the socio-economic spectrum. They should not be. Rather, they engage sectors (geographical and socio-economic) that they believe will have effect. (Marginalia: I have no idea who Tawny is, and I don't have a television. And I am not from the US. Sorry.)\r\n\r\nb) It is unfortunate that in many cases, true justice is not afforded to the poor (they cannot afford it) or the rich (they can buy their own flavour of justice), particularly when the two groups meet in the courtroom. However, it is the case that this is so. Nepotism, patronage, bribery, &amp;c. have always reared their ugly little faces the most when people are threatened or vulnerable, and hence even in the least corruptible of societies, the rich gain, *ceteris paribus* the upper hand, whilst the poor do not. I think this is a bad thing. Yet it is the truth, and to deny this is blind idealism. \r\n\r\nc) I obviously do not detest 'everyday people' and it is disappointing to have to respond to such questions. My utterance of 'society' in the context used was only in reference to those parts of society that affect the jurisprudential calculus in question - those who can affect the outcome - which I imagined would be clear. Even from an a priori understanding of what was written: can one imagine *any* part of society being up in arms about a random youth of a poor background being incarcerated with drug-related charges? I think not - it simply forms part of the background noise in much of the US. However, if someone from a rich background is incarcerated, then there are relevant cleavages in society who may protest it. Again - this is not the way things should be. I in no way endorse it. It is, however, the current state of affairs. \r\n\r\nI have never discouraged movement against the War on Drugs. I would encourage you to read that which I have written again. I personally think that individuals should be at liberty to do what they want to their own bodies, insofar as it does not adversely affect others. I have simply stressed that the current War on Drugs policy is backed by a strong believed moral mandate. Just because I (strongly) disagree with their moral systems does not mean I shall deny them acknowledgment. Executive government, without doubt, is in the business of perpetuating rule. Yet this is not a) at any cost, and b) *amongst other things*. Leaders also make decisions because they think it is the correct thing to do - the right thing for the people, regardless of whether it is right by the people. \r\n\r\nEssentially, I would beg of you to realise that not all policies enacted by government are done for selfish ends. \r\n\r\nMy name is Alexander.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166656779,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42056-a8178eb0-fffb-4bab-8bd4-0b42ad75b8e6-1566236774"}

We never had police at my schools in Australia and the teachers were able to control ANY situation without resorting to violence. And that is exactly what using a taser is. Violence with a capital V and totally unnecessary. \r\n\r\nFer chrissake, when are you people going to learn? Violence begets violence. If the boy wouldn't stop beating up the girl, you grab hold and physically restrain him. He's a little boy not some hulking criminal. What a disgusting situation. You should all be ashamed of yourselves for allowing these things to go on.","controversiality":0,"ups":1,"score":1,"created_utc":1165022865,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t47z","id":"ctawr","author":"ThaiTai","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807534,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2608-baa02ab8-770a-4dbb-9e73-353ec7ce096b-1566236759"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"regexes are widely used because they are effective, particularly when you need a solution in a very short period of time. regexes also provide solutions that tend to be more robust in some ways. look at the last posting by dons for his \"programming haskell\" series - he reads in a file of student names and grades. now i would say you want to use a regex to read in the input lines. this would allow you to extract the input with higher tolerance for errors - extra spaces, blank lines, junk chars, etc. i don't know of any simple and rapid method for dealing with dirty data than regexes (and of course you should assume all data is dirty until proven otherwise). \r\n","link_id":"t3_v35v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166400714,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"skyskraper","id":"cv5ln","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v35v","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808785,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34736-993b86a3-d893-4c6c-953f-248ed7a2a5b6-1566236771"}

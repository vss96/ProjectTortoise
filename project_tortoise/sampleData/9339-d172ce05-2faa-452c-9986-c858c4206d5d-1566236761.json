However, gold does still fluctuate strongly because of its usefulness as a store of value.  Value may be subjective, but there's very little that could significantly decrease the perceived value of gold in the near future short of a gold asteroid hitting earth.\r\n\r\nAs for the gold standard, there is an opposing point of view, called Austrian Business Cycle Theory, which argues that no group of central bankers has enough information to do a better job of \"running* the economy than all the individual economic actors doing their own thing.  Central bankers have a strong incentive to pump more money into the economy to stimulate consumer spending and \"fake\" growth, but this comes at a cost that must be paid down the line.  Remember that we've only been off the gold standard for about 30 years.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tkec","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165339731,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9339-d172ce05-2faa-452c-9986-c858c4206d5d-1566236761"}

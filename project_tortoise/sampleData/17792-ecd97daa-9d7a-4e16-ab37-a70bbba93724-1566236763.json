I know some people have problems installing behind a firewall, but `setuptools`, `easy_install`, PyPI/Cheeseshop, etc. all work fine for me installing, creating, and managing packages.

Why reinvent the wheel when the solution is already there and Python makes it easy to wire things together?  The trend (especially with Python web frameworks) has actually been to increase the number of dependencies by splitting monolithic projects into smaller independent projects that can be easily mixed and matched (see WSGI, Paste, Zope repackaging, Pylons `-&gt;` `webhelpers` / `routes` / `beaker` / ..., TurboGears `-&gt;` `TurboJson` / templating engines / `ToscaWidgets`, ...).","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u5es","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808140,"distinguished":null,"author":"lost-theory","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cu697","edited":false,"id":"cu79g","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17792-ecd97daa-9d7a-4e16-ab37-a70bbba93724-1566236763"}

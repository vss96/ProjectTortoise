{"body":"Try slackware.  For all the bad rep, it's actually become pretty damned user friendly the last couple releases.  I've heard good things about Debian and Fedora as well, but have yet to try them.  I'd avoid Ubuntu simply because a lot of the general purpose 'linux help' you'll run into on the net will apply to almost every distro...except Ubuntu.  The no true root / su thing is nice in ways, but there are some things that you can fix with a certain series of identical or nearly identical commands on nearly any *nix that *buntu just seems to puke and die over.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I suppose in all fairness it is entirely possible that in the three releases I have tried on probably four or five different PC's that ran FreeBSD or Slackware fine I have just miraculously, every single time, hit on rare, undocumented / unfixable / 'being worked on' (and has been since forever with no movement) bugs that make *buntu hell but would be no problem almost anywhere else.  Maybe I'm just horribly unlucky or something.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tly1","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165345173,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"oditogre","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctpqp","id":"ctqe5","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807825,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9562-139b25f0-cd59-407a-bd49-502cdff0f5ab-1566236761"}

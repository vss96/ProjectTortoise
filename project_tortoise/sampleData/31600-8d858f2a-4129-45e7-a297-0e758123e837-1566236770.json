The thing that pisses me off most about your post is \"MOST problem domains.\"  All you need in your requirements is either to be very quickly interactive, or to have lots of data, or some algorithm that just can't help but be n^2 or worse and suddenly performance matters and it matters almost everywhere in your program. (please don't bother talking about optimizing your tight loops to assembler, it really doesn't work that way) About the only time performance doesn't matter is when you are dealing with small data sets and the app is user interaction bound.  And web apps sometimes can be slow because they can easily become network bound.\r\n\r\nAlso, are you claiming that Ruby is 30X more productive?  Do you really believe that?","link_id":"t3_uqnu","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808662,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Wriiight","id":"cuz25","parent_id":"t1_curhs","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31600-8d858f2a-4129-45e7-a297-0e758123e837-1566236770"}

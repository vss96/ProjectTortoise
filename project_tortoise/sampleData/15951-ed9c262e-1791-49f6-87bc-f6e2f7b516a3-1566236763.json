Ok, plenty of good paintings with long brush strokes. Now, let's apply this to an engineering discipline of which programming is closer to. If you're designing a car, do you limit yourself to seven inch contiguous pieces of metal, or do you not arbitrarily limit yourself and instead make pieces the optimal length as far as you can figure it to be? Can such analogies ever really be applicable when the nature of programming doesn't lend itself to having physical analogues? Is this paragraph too long, or is it the just the right size since it encapsulates a contiguous, homogenous thought flow?","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808080,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu43m","parent_id":"t1_cu2cu","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Entropy","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15951-ed9c262e-1791-49f6-87bc-f6e2f7b516a3-1566236763"}

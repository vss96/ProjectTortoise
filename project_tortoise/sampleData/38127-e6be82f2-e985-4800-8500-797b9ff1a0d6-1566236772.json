If you really need that, just wait a few months for the prices to step down after the buying rush. Also, chances are that you'll realize in a few months that you really didn't need it.\r\n\r\n- distance yourself from TV and other kinds of massive advertising, they're here to make you buy things you don't really need. The Internet is now a pretty amazing place to get your news &amp; entertainment without being *bombarded* by useless crap. I also recommend cancelling your cable subscription and buying TV shows box sets instead, the experience is just so much better.\r\n\r\n- when shopping, try something new, and find what best suits you. Not everyone needs to grow its own vegetables, or shop exclusively to the local grocery market; but at least give it a try, it could be fun once in a while.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808917,"gilded":0,"id":"cvck6","parent_id":"t1_cvchf","edited":false,"author":"trutru","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38127-e6be82f2-e985-4800-8500-797b9ff1a0d6-1566236772"}

I gave up. I didn't f..king care anymore. I was a stupid 13 year old. I could program, but I couldn't make good decisions. I had no faith in the system. Before this incident I was tormented by bullies and I appealed to authority and they always blamed me. They told me to quit reacting to the bullies and it would stop. I lost all faith in adults including my parents. I don't blame my parents though. In the early 80s no one was home schooling and the private schools were even worse. I don't know what choice they had. At least we have choices today.\r\n\r\nWhy would the teacher fail you?\r\nI don't know for sure. I never spoke to him again. I can only guess. I think he spent a lot of time setting everything up and planning the class and I completed something that was supposed to take four and half months and did it in a few minutes on the first day. I think he felt humiliated by a student and he feared losing the students respect in the classrom. To an 8th grade teacher losing the respect of the class is death.\r\n\r\nI still remember the program in concept. It was a blocky looking graphical sailboat(already created) and we were supposed to make the boat sail from one side of the monitor to the other. I made it circle the screen several times and sail off the screen. It was just some simple math and a loop, but in 1982 I was the only kid in school that knew how to do it.","link_id":"t3_ut1n","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166189954,"ups":7,"score":7,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30341-ff0b618d-5a6c-4367-8777-27c29c2e5ab4-1566236769"}

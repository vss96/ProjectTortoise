It just seems to me that the odds of getting shot are much greater if everyone has a gun than if only hardcore criminals do.\r\n\r\nI don't have any \"motives\".  I just don't get the American fascination with owning guns. :-)  I also don't see why the thoughts of a few guys 230 years ago are considered so sacrosanct...apart from the bits that were amended, of course.\r\n\r\nI didn't suggest that you should give up legal guns in the US.  I just said that we don't have the right to own guns and we seem to have a lot less gun crime than you.  Yes you can argue that the two facts may not be related but if self defence was really such an issue, would you not expect a lot more innocent civilians to be shot here?\r\n\r\nAs for legalisation of drugs, I agree that that is probably the single thing that would make the biggest difference to crime stats, whether gun related or not.  I think police estimate that 50% of break ins in the UK are drugs related.  If the stuff was freely available, I like to think you could wipe out a substantial amount of that sort of crime.  No government would have the nerve to do it though.\r\n\r\nAnyway it appears we'll have to agree to differ here.  Fortunately we are free to do that. :-)","link_id":"t3_u9bd","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165797056,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21115-bf13b287-b2d0-42af-9399-c8db4db21030-1566236765"}

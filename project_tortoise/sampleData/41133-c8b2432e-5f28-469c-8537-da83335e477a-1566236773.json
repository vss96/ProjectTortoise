But just because everyone is having premarital sex doesn't make it right. Just because everyone is doing drugs doesn't make it right. Now, there may be some legitimate arguments for these activities, but that \"everyone is doing it\" isn't one of them.\r\n\r\nI too have a deeply religious friend who had a wild past. This doesn't mean that he was glad for his wild past. I wonder about this married couple leading the youth group -- are they proud of their past? Are there things that they regret? Are they hurt by things in their past? I would imagine the answer is yes. My own friend treats his past as a learning experience, and he cautions others to avoid the pain he went through.\r\n\r\nIn short, just because everyone does it doesn't -- by itself -- make it right.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166633729,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":10,"ups":10,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41133-c8b2432e-5f28-469c-8537-da83335e477a-1566236773"}

{"body":"&gt; \"Functions cannot be nested.\"\r\n\r\n&gt; That's not really a common or needed feature, is it?\r\n\r\nIt's a very common and useful feature among programmers using languages that support it.  Many situations that require a class or secondary data parameter in Java or PHP can be handled very elegantly with a closure in Python, Ruby, Scheme, or Haskell.  Even worse, many Java and PHP developers duplicate code (without realizing they're duplicating code) because the abovementioned workarounds are too clumsy.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_uvma","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166218679,"score":8,"ups":8,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuyey","id":"cuyql","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808655,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31463-0bad8c0c-3296-48b1-b6ed-2d68b7f4d82f-1566236770"}

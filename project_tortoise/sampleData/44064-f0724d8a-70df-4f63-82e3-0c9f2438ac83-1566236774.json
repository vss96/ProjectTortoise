{"body":"A single large monitor is always better than two small ones.  That is assuming the big one is twice as big as the small one.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that once you get out of the mass market monitor size, you pay dearly for the extra size.  You can get two 20\" 1680x1050 LCD for less than half the price of a single 24\" 1900x1200 LCD.\r\n\r\n(2x1680x1050)/(1900x1200) = 1.547 so you get more pixels with two monitors as well.  At home, I went from two 19\" CRTs to a single 22\" 1680x1050 LCD.  I miss the extra screen space for programming, but the 22\" widescreen LCD is sooooo much better for watching video.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vn37","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166732060,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"setuid_w00t","parent_id":"t1_cvo3m","edited":false,"id":"cvo8u","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809144,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44064-f0724d8a-70df-4f63-82e3-0c9f2438ac83-1566236774"}

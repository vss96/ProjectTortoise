Your claim that TCP/IP is \"hacked\" onto the box just reinforces this.  \r\n\r\nWe were talking about Apple's ability to make small-box operating systems.  If your complaints are about weight and size, given that the Newton is 1995 technology and could only run on NiMH, and has a screen four times the Blackberry's, I think you have no argument at all.\r\n\r\nSimply put:  the Newton showed that Apple is among the best in its class when it comes to making small-device operating systems.  And the iPod has shown that Apple's among the best in its class when it comes to making small devices.  Yet you somehow put 2 and 2 together and come up with this belief that Apple can't compete in the small device / small device OS market.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21077-65e61910-6a3b-4614-b973-c8c81c8c73e8-1566236765"}

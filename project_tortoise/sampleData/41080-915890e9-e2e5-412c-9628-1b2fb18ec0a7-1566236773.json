{"body":"Actually, your wrong.  It is the State that tortures people. \r\n\r\nBy definition, the State **is** \"people\" (of course), but it is not just \"any\" people that torture and not just \"any\" or \"all\" people belong to the State. It is State sponsoored and State paid thugs who torture people (cops fall into this catagory too).\r\n\r\nIt is the agents of the State that are engaged in torture, whether they are soldiers or politicians.  To the rest of us, who lives outside of that dark, depraved world, it seems inhuman and wrong (it is).  But to those inside, it seems totally justifiable and right.\r\n\r\nStates have **always** governed by fear and force (go look it up), torture is an extension of that fear and force.  The IRS for example, extracts blood money by fear and force, backed up with guns, another agency of the State, also backed up by paid thugs.\r\n\r\nAll of government operates on this principle. States have long tortured people that did not comply to their demands. It is not only physical torture, but mental and emotional torture too.\r\n\r\nEvery been to court?  Ever had to run the gauntlet in your defense because the State has decided you are guilty of one of their millions of infractions?  Ever had to liquidate all of your assets and beg for an attorney to defend your case from the State?  Ever had your assets confiscated?  Every lost your job because of State interference?\r\n\r\nAll these things are forms of torture too.  It should not cost an arm and a leg and your house and your job and your wife to defend yourself against a State-sponsored smear campaign for some stupid \"State-infraction\".  \r\n\r\nThe practice is very common - bankrupt and destroy the victim even though no conviction will be possible.  This is also torture of course.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know who is behind the torture, it **is** the State.  Many people are quite willing to work for the State because they believe they are doing more help then harm (and they like the paycheck and benefits). But what they do not connect in their minds is how the State operates by force in everything it does and how it leave a ruin of lives in its wake.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vcii","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166632634,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lifeofliberty","parent_id":"t1_cvdhh","id":"cvi7t","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809028,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41080-915890e9-e2e5-412c-9628-1b2fb18ec0a7-1566236773"}

You enter your OpenID URL at a website. The server checks that URL and redirects you to your OpenID provider.\r\n\r\nStep 2. You log in at your provider's site (unless you've already done so and have a cookie set ... standard fair there) and decide what information about yourself you want to share with the original site.\r\n\r\nStep 3. Your OpenID provider redirects you to the original site, which handles the rest of the process.\r\n\r\nIt can get more confusing with some of the weirder stuff (like using your website as a sort of name proxy for the OpenID provider) but that is the gist of it. It is relatively safe, although I do worry about someone pulling some really smart phishing with it.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vder","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808986,"author":"senzei","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvg3s","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvg0q","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40071-123dc614-c654-42dd-bc00-61567cc4b86b-1566236773"}

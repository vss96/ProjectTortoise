{"link_id":"t3_tyxw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"While I agree that a comment does not seek to imply the total complexities, the idea that 1:5 efficiency is the best we can get is ludicrous, but even taking it as fact:\r\n\r\n8x as much coal per oil may sound bad, but we have roughly 4x as much proven coal reserves as oil reserves on this planet, (and especially in the USA where this ratio is much, much higher than even 8) so while it will require a big change in the amount we mine, it is not impossible, and will be done more and more over time as oil prices go up, leaving us with a smooth transition, unlike running into a brick wall, which is my problem with the peak oil theory: the brick wall is averted by the market. Using your numbers, then, ignoring the other uses of coal in power plants etc which are big users no doubt, coal buys us roughly 50% more oil reserves before the big peak some people want us to fear :)\r\n\r\nCoal is obviously no long term solution, because it, like oil, only has a certain amount of easily accessible tonnage, and will peak in the same way as oil, but it will buy is decades, and in decades other technologies we haven't even considered will surely be in play.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165519012,"ups":1,"score":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cu0mj","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu0fc","author_flair_text":null,"author":"andrewd","retrieved_on":1473808015,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14347-d8550227-1399-4877-9d65-490e5e03734a-1566236762"}

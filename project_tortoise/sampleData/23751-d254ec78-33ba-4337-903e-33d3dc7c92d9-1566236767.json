Getting some mass from Earth-surface to Earth-orbit requires a huge chunk of energy; soft-landing that mass on the moon requires a huge chunk of energy; and lifting that mass off of the moon again requires another huge chunk.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the energy required to sling some mass from one orbit to another is (relatively) small. If you've built all the pieces of a vehicle to Mars on Earth and you've already lifted them as high as Earth orbit, it's going to be far cheaper to assemble them in Earth orbit and go directly to Mars orbit from there. Taking the vehicle pieces to the moon would be a wild detour. It would be like going NYC to LA by way of Seattle, on the grounds that Seattle is closer to LA than NYC is.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808350,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuhy3","edited":false,"id":"cuicr","author":"Lagged2Death","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23751-d254ec78-33ba-4337-903e-33d3dc7c92d9-1566236767"}

Basically it boils down to not playing games.  Being honest.  Actually *telling* your partner your needs, actually *listening* to theirs, and actually *trying* to fulfill those needs.  Not always the most realistic picture of things, but a wise enough goal for both sexes to strive towards.\r\n\r\n&gt; 21\\. Being too much of a pussy to tell him what is or isn't acceptable before you start bumping uglies. Be honest. If he asks if he can poke you in the butt, and you giggle and say no like it's an invitation, don't look surprised when he \"accidentally\" sticks his cock in your butt.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; ...\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 34\\. Launching into some speech about not being an object for sex when he tries to titty fuck you. Jesus Christ, just push them together and enjoy yourself. You get a great view.\r\n\r\nThese almost seem contradictory.  I fully agree with #21; if you don't like a thing, say \"No.\"  And be clear about it.  I suppose #34 was to argue against the opposite extreme of becoming offended and \"launching into some speech about\" it.\r\n\r\n&gt; 42\\. Not making any noises at all. Moan. Scream his name. Something so he knows he's the best you've had, even if he isn't.\r\n\r\nOkay, this is a *little* dishonest, especially since the *very next* one tells you not to fake orgasms, but I imagine she was just exagerrating for effect.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the article as a whole is clear, frank, and surprisingly mature.  Good stuff.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tho0","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1165228038,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6303-296b0bb6-133c-4c46-aa78-39159f685826-1566236760"}

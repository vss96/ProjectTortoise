I for one, don't mind breastfeeding, or kissing between couples (although the latter only reminds me i'm single :( ). Overall, I agree with your comment that people should tone it down and keep thier conduct within acceptable standards, but you saying all gays love attention is simply incorrect.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t6wc","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2602-557aed0e-ef5e-4c8d-abc8-34b540301444-1566236759"}

These 10 friends vowed last year not to purchase a single new thing in 2006 -- except food, the bare necessities for health and safety (toilet paper, brake fluid) and, thankfully, underwear, and maybe socks (they're still debating whether new socks are okay).\r\n\r\nuhm, I live like this most of the time.  I only buy what I need.  Most people who aren't so ready to whip out credit cards or just can't stop spending do this too.  If you don't need junk, there's no need to buy it.  This story makes it out like this is some super amazing thing these friends did.  It's really not that hard of a thing to do.","created_utc":1166491204,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":22,"ups":22,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvali","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v95u","author_flair_text":null,"author":"berberine","retrieved_on":1473808880,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37264-9b188d80-6064-421a-9212-662874245459-1566236772"}

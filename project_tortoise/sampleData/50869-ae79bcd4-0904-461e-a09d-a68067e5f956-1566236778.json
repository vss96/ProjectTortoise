I've learned several, from Pascal when I was 8 (only prog. lang books in the library) to Java in high school, to PL/SQL when I worked in an Oracle Development shop. I've also learned smalltalk, ruby, and have a full year doing .NET commercial development.\r\n\r\nMy current challenge is migrating some old Oracle-based Apps to J2EE. The issue is that while I already know Java, picking up all the J2EE framework stuff _IS_ tougher than it looks (granted, I haven't given it the time it deserves). You've got Spring, Struts, Hibernate, and all the Web Services stuff to play with. Its the first time I really felt that you can't \"just pick up\" a technology and get something out the door.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vs9v","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50869-ae79bcd4-0904-461e-a09d-a68067e5f956-1566236778"}

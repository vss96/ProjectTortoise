This means that one cannot set up a VoIP telephone system that works reliably.  While I agree that this particular law probably shouldn't have passed, it is painfully obvious that something like this **must pass** eventually.  ISPs must have the right to negotiate QoS contracts with other ISPs and sell QoS services to customers.  It will be tricky to legislate and still preserve neutrality.  There will be compromises to make.  I doubt that Congress will get it right on the first try.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165786179,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20789-72eb2a2c-6ee2-4b5c-80f5-0a763fa521ee-1566236765"}

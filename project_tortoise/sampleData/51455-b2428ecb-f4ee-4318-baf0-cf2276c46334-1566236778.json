And he pretty much turned half his backyard (where, I assume kids play) into a toxic waste dump.\r\n\r\nThat's exactly why this is awesome. Sometimes DIY is worth the fun and games even if it's stupid. I don't know about \"left wing liberal pansies\" but seriously, how many of you would have \"called your local beekeeper\"?

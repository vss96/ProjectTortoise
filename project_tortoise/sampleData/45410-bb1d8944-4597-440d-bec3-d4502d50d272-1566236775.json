A good theory should provide unique predictions which can be validated (proved) via experiment.  If experiment does not repeatedly produce the expected results, then the theory is false.  This is how you disprove a theory, by attempting to prove it.\r\n\r\nThe argument of disproving something is worthless.  It's easy to conjure up a ridiculous theory that cannot be proved.  Example: prove that invisible pink unicorns don't exist.  You can't.  Why?  Because part of my conjecture is that you can't measure it.  Worse yet is a conjecture that consistently changes in the face of evidence against it.  For any reason why you say my unicorns are nonsense I can invoke more magic as to why they evade detection.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vo8v","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809195,"author":"farra","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvqx8","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvqsu","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45410-bb1d8944-4597-440d-bec3-d4502d50d272-1566236775"}

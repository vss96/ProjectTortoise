The word \"JavaScript\" doesn't even appear in that article at all.  I see him advocating leaving the font size alone so that the visitor's preferences are automatically respected without any code whatsoever.\r\n\r\nFlexible font size is not something you have to work towards on the web.  It's something that's there by default.  He's saying \"leave it flexible instead of screwing it up\", not \"build all kinds of gimmicks\".\r\n\r\n&gt; BTW, do you know how huge MS Sans Serif 10 point is on a 640x480 screen?\r\n\r\nYes.  What are you getting at?  He's not saying that the font size should be set in points, he's saying that it should be left at what the user has configured.","created_utc":1165249566,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctkha","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctkfa","author":"Bogtha","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473807715,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6805-331e6537-9ea7-4d95-a90c-44ce5a389e18-1566236760"}

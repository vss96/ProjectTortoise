Do you think nearly as many people would use meth if cocaine was legal?  Would it be produced safely for the few that choose to use it?\r\n\r\nHawaii has had a huge meth problem for a long time, probably since before you heard of it.  Definitely since before any of the continental states had a problem.  The problems exists strictly because it's hard to get drugs into Hawaii (coke, heroin, etc.) for the obviously logistical reason.  When the DEA hard core cracked down on locally grown pot, meth use jumped up exponentially.  When the US had prohibition, hard liquor consumption jumped dramatically.  I'm sure there are other examples.  \r\n\r\nAs a \"pretty druggy\" person, I would hope you get it.  Drug prohibition leads to harder, more dangerous drug use.","link_id":"t3_ttnc","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12227-79224944-8904-47d6-a3f4-cfb6073121c5-1566236761"}

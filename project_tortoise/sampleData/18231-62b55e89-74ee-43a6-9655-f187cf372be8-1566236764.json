It's what I want to shove in the face of the people who bring up the \"they're all Turing complete!\" argument whenever a discussion arises about the relative expressiveness of certain languages.\r\n\r\nLet me give a quote from the introduction that gives a taste of what Felleisen means by expressiveness:\r\n\r\n&gt; Here \"more expressive\" means that the translation of a program with occurrences of one of the constructs ci to the smaller language requires a global reorganization of the entire program.\r\n\r\nPut differently: a feature does not increase expressiveness if it can be implemented as \"local\" syntactic sugar. So, Steele and Sussman's original Scheme is less expressive (in the sense of Felleisen) than Scheme with call/cc because to implement call/cc in core Scheme you need something like whole-program CPS-conversion.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808157,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_u719","id":"cu849","edited":false,"author":"psykotic","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18231-62b55e89-74ee-43a6-9655-f187cf372be8-1566236764"}

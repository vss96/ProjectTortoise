I'm not even sure that there are alternative theories. If someone knows more, I'd be interested.\r\n\r\n&gt;    Any aspect of material reality which the scientist can demonstrate to me can be reproduced as information. The scientific explanation is only valid insofar as it is precise – and that is the precise quality needed to render it exactly into information. Therefore I do not need the existence of material reality.\r\n\r\n&gt;    We conceive instead a random information soup. In place of competition for chemicals or territory we conceive competition for processing power or memory, and see how recurring calculations such as infinite series could evolve in analogy to crystal structures, and how these would gain advantage in an information soup. We also conceive that programs with more flexible internal structures could also evolve and replicate (in analogy with viruses) and have even a greater advantage. And there would be further advantages in those programs which aggregate into complex information structures which model their own inner universes, because they would be self motivating like living organisms. So a virtual reality like our universe could be just one of many similar or diverse universes that have evolved within the information soup, and it owes its survival to having evolved a set of ‘physical’ laws and constants which is consistent with a stable and competitive universe – just as the internal structure of the higher animals can be shown to have evolved by enhancing their survival.\r\n\r\n&gt;    In the biochemical model, however, the most complex organisms have evolved consciousness, which presumably must have some survival advantage. It is not unlikely, therefore, that the most complex universes in our information soup will also be conscious, as it would give them a similar survival advantage. So it is quite natural to assume that our universe is a conscious entity.\r\n\r\n    -Ramsey Dukes (Quote Edited for Space and Relevance, Run-on sentences left intact)\r\n\r\nIf the universe is conscious, then that \"god\" would not be a personal one, and therefore it doesn't really matter if you believe in it or not.  Never-the-less, the positions are distinguishable.  It's as if my blood cells debated about my intelligence.  One position is right.  The other is wrong.

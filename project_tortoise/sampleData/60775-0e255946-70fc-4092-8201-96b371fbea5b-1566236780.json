Ergonomics seemed fine to me. Generally the build quality seemed excellent.\r\n\r\nThere are some little things I notice sometimes, like if the little handle to open the door from inside can move at all perpendicular to the direction it's supposed to. In the Cobalt, these components seemed to follow fairly tight tolerances.\r\n\r\nContrast this with a Pontiac Grand Am I rented once. It was an automatic with shift on the floor. The button on the side of the shift was some kind of loose \"hat\", so when it was depressed to shift, it would wobble all over the place.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't go so far as to whole-heartedly recommend the car, since I haven't really had a chance to check it out thoroughly. But I've done about 12 hours of driving in them, and thought they were better than most rentals. That you think so little of them is interesting to me. Can you give more details?","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wi17","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167600616,"ups":1,"score":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60775-0e255946-70fc-4092-8201-96b371fbea5b-1566236780"}

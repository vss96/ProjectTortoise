Irrelevant or incorrect science, sure, but never useless. Bad science, OTOH, is untruthful or exists solely to further an agenda counterproductive to science itself. I can think of a few recent examples in biology and meteorology, just as you point out.\r\n\r\nOf course these buffoons are only out to confuse people. It's what they do. Especially people who don't have science education or interest. The worst part is how they get all the media publicity they want, amazingly and incredibly overrepresented compared to real scientists - who are almost entirely dispresent in american media. And since it's on the teevee, it's true, right?\r\n\r\nIt's really sad, that this is what the average level of education has come to in this country, and how easily the \"public\" is convinced and swayed at the wave of a bundle of cash, some bright colors and a dramatic recycled soundtrack.\r\n\r\nYou're right, the forces behind creationism are not stupid. They're just evil, greedy and harmful to human progress.\r\n\r\nOh, and BTW, feel free to join my new organization, Gravity is Evil, where we aim to prove that since gravity pulls you down, it's the work of the devil drawing you towards hell. :)\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28872-33645479-f9f6-48de-8f78-c31ce98aa103-1566236768"}

Income from illegal activity should be reported as \"other income\" on line 21 of the 1040. This is also where you report things like Jury duty (and many other activities), so it doesn't necessarily mean that you are admiting to any illegal activity.\r\n\r\nSo here's a situation where I could make $1000, and the government takes 25% to bring my paycheck down to $750. Then Steve steals it from me (apparently I just cashed it), and will pay an additional $180 in tax. Now the government has $430 of the original. Forget that, man. That money was taxed enough already. I hope Steve doesn't report it. In fact, I hope he sends in a 1040EZ that says \"I stole $750 and I'm not reporting it.

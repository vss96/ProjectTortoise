I would take screecheroos or hummeroos and pound them lightly with a hammer to break up the hard block inside into powder.  I would then pour the powder out onto wax paper.  I repeated this until I was satisfied with the size of the mound of powder.  I then twisted the wax paper to compress the powder into a little ball and then wrapped it with a layer of tape (electrician's or duct).  I then poked a hole big enough for the wick and proceeded to wrap the ball with much more tape.\r\n\r\nI'm from Canada, so we had to make our own explosives.  We couldn't just go out and buy stuff like M-80s.","link_id":"t3_u5p4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17890-4ea18485-0862-41b8-96bb-3b2fc11847e2-1566236763"}

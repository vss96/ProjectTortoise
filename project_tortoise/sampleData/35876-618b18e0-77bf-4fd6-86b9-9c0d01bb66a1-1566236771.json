{"body":"The capital-L Libertarians aren't going to switch.  The \"economically conservative, socially liberal\" shorthand is an oversimplification; they're not \"socially liberal\" in the same way the Democrats are.\r\n\r\nLook at the social (non-economic) issues that make it to the Libertarian Party website:  freedom of speech, gun laws, internet, privacy - issues that affect the young, straight middle-to-upper class white males that are the backbone of their party.  (I believe they used to have drug law reform as a core issue as well, but it's not there now.)\r\n\r\nWhen you step outside those issues to the ones that don't directly impact most Libertarians, support wanes.  Abortion?  They're divided.  Gay marriage?  They tend to take the cop-out of saying the state shouldn't sanction any marriage, without explaining how they'd get there from here.  Racism and sexism?  Not the government's problem; let the market sort it - and everything else - out.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v40x","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166455166,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jfpbookworm","edited":false,"id":"cv7wu","parent_id":"t3_v40x","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808829,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35876-618b18e0-77bf-4fd6-86b9-9c0d01bb66a1-1566236771"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"I didn't suggest you support acts of terrorism, but that you seem to support the suspension of basic human rights (the right to a fair trial if the state thinks you committed a crime) for people whose religion you dislike.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it sounds like you have some misapprehensions about the Qu'ran. Like most religious documents (actually read the Bible if you doubt this), the Qu'ran contains passages that advocate violence under certain circumstances. However, the overwhelming message, also like most religious documents, is to live piously, be kind to others, and so on.\r\n\r\nMost Muslims are not extremists, fundamentalists, or terrorists, just as most Christians are not these things. Don't allow the widespread coverage of a relatively few people to prejudice you against the majority.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tkwz","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165261883,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctldh","id":"ctlfm","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807732,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7279-56226aae-27d8-435b-b0de-a8be1f33f916-1566236760"}

I've added the \"increment an instance variable\" to not have empty methods to avoid that Ruby and/or Python eventually perform optimizations that they wouldn't do on non-empty methods.\r\n\r\nPython doesn't actually perform those kinds of optimizations by default. In particular, doing 1+1 in the method without storing it would be a better measure, since in incrementing an instance variable you're actually causing two invocations in python.\r\n\r\nobj.x += 5 is, roughly speaking, a method invocation in python (just with different syntax).\r\n\r\n&gt;I've said that method invocation is faster in Ruby, and I still think that it's true.\r\n\r\nWell first you have to really benchmark it. use the timeit module in python, xrange instead of range and new-style classes to get accurate results.\r\n\r\n&gt;Well, English is not my native language, and after looking \"universally\" up in the dictionary, it seems that I didn't actually express what I wanted to.\r\n\r\nYou're in good company. Even us native english speakers have trouble with that sometimes.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uqnu","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28991-afc8d338-41de-4fef-9daf-3651e5f34d68-1566236768"}

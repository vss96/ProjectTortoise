IE is basically an interpreter for a (non-Turing-complete) language, taking in a textual description of a webpage and writing a series of instructions to the video card that output a visual representation.  It's no different than the JVM reading in a file containing Java bytecodes and outputting a series of instructions to the network card, disk, video card, or various other devices, modulo the Turing-completeness.\r\n\r\nIt's not something a normal programmer would say, though.

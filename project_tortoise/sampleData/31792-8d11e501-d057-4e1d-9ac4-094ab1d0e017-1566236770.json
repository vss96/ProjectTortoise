My problem was with your statement apply(f,x,y) is immediately clear.  Which it is not immediately clear you still have to know what the function apply actually does to understand it.\r\n\r\nBut in general I agree with you.   I am not confortable with the fact that apply, map and other functions are being questioned in python.  However I have been able to live with the purposed alternatives.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31792-8d11e501-d057-4e1d-9ac4-094ab1d0e017-1566236770"}

The customer was arrested because the ink on the bills smeared. The fact that they were $2 bills was incidental.\r\n\r\nThe printing ink used in currency doesn't smear and the bills were established as legitimate. It can be inferred that the \"smearing\" was a lame excuse and a lie on the part of the clerk to cover their inappropriate conduct.  I'm surprised the cops who arrested him didn't \"smell marijuana\" on his clothes, another popular excuse for misconduct.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55958-6b0d7a5c-fa91-44c0-ab02-d415fe371ab4-1566236779"}

Every professional .NET programmer needs to learn about FP, and there’s no better way to do it than by learning F#—and no easier way to learn F# than from Foundations of F#.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If you’re already familiar with FP, you’ll find F# the language you’ve always dreamed of. And all .NET programmers will find F# an exciting real-world alternative to C# and Visual Basic. This book is likely to have many imitators, but few true competitors. Written by F# evangelist Rob Pickering, and tech reviewed by F#’s inventor, Don Syme, this is an elegant, comprehensive introduction to all aspects of the language and an incisive guide to using F# for real-world professional development. F# is the future of programming (not just on .NET), and the future is now.\r\n\r\nAPress seems to have an amazingly hip attitude towards functional programming compared to O'Reilly.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1164959816,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"programming","id":"ct7b3","parent_id":"t3_t70b","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"schwarzwald","retrieved_on":1473807466,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"808-cb418665-1d96-4bfa-a1ce-501b6679e6c0-1566236758"}

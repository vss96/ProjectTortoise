I'd really hate to be looking at some code, see that the \"name\" field is a \"Name\" object, and have to look at the Name class only to find out that it's just an extension of String. XML Hell is for the most part a good point, but XML does come in handy in places, like the Spring Framework.\r\n\r\n&gt;Pick a style for local variables, parameters, instance variables, method names, class names, package names, constructor names, and accessor names.\r\n\r\nHopefully I'm just misunderstanding him. Does he want a different prefix/suffix for different types of variables? If not, why would he distinguish local variables from instance variables? If so, what the hell is wrong with Hungarian notation? My editor (Eclipse) is able to tell the difference between a local variable and a instance variable, I certainly don't need to name them differently.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm not impressed. It has an exceptionally arrogant tone for things that are just \"personal\" pet peeves, and the issues he brings up are neither novel nor universal.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808050,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cu2h6","parent_id":"t3_u0r5","edited":false,"author":"carpeliam","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15216-c0c33e6c-d4e2-4272-af22-8a653c19cc46-1566236762"}

Having a non-iPod MP3 player, I can't use ITMS, and I haven't bothered with any others. But Limewire is getting suckier and suckier these days, so maybe I'll give this an honest shot now.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** First impression: found several things I was interested in (good swing recording are hard to find on filesharing networks), but they don't take MasterCard, so I have no way of paying for it.\r\n\r\n**Edit 2:** Okay, I was able to purchase an iCard at some sketchy website, and then use that to power up my AllofMP3 account. I picked four albums I wanted to download, and am now working on that, using FlashGot. Unfortunately, it's slow as molasses... not sure if that's my crappy connection or theirs.","retrieved_on":1473809265,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvulr","parent_id":"t1_cvu0v","author_flair_text":null,"author":"mikepurvis","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47329-286853a2-803d-451e-88cc-a467ee9bd95b-1566236775"}

Enough to comment on how similar it is to Lisp?\r\n\r\nThe original newsgroup thread had Lisp advocates both admiring Pythons libraries and being dismissive of Pythons links to other languages in order to make their libraries available to Python.\r\n\r\nTake another run at the quote you gave:\r\n\r\n\"Lisp is its own interpreter and compiler, which should be a great advantage, but only if you don't make the mistake of ignoring the wealth of code out there that is written in other languages.\"\r\n\r\nI don't say that Lisp ignores code written in other languages. I am trying to make the point that because Lisp has a compiler, Lisp users might be more likely to 'roll-their-own' than the Pythoneer. \r\n- Paddy.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_unxc","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809013,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Paddy3118","id":"cvhic","parent_id":"t1_cuny0","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40717-b8ae3a8e-2ce9-4e47-b6b3-202a9a80464c-1566236773"}

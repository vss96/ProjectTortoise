Here's the faults we had with it:\r\n\r\n* The fuel pump blew out twice.\r\n\r\n* It was so high up compared to, say, the Jeep Cherokee, that it was unstable to drive and could easily fall over. In fact, that almost happened to me one morning. I was too tired and did the dumb thing of pulling out in front of someone. I quickly caught on that I was about to get killed by that stupid move and spun the vehicle into my lane in the nick of time. Then, the vehicle's other two wheels came down with a thunk.\r\n\r\n* The suspension was too tough. You feel every bump and it shakes your insides up. This is also oddly worse in the back seat and it will be the last back seat ride you will ever do.\r\n\r\n* The column mounted transmission lever was for dorks.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ualz","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808209,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"supermike","edited":false,"id":"cuayj","parent_id":"t3_ualz","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19774-b2bec5a1-6647-421c-9484-fa41121e7d32-1566236764"}

Writing *a* module was indeed fairly fun.\r\n\r\nDeploying a combination of modules was very much indeed *not* much fun.\r\n\r\nSo I'd say Ericsson's biggest blunder when it comes to Erlang is the PITA that deployment of several Erlang apps can be. Because the language itself is nice (albeit some of the punctuation is an irritant at times) and the VM is amazing (particularly now that it can utilise multiprocessors very, very well).\r\n\r\nBut one of the comments (from Tobbe, one of the Erlang gurus) is pure comedy gold:\r\n\r\nYariv wrote:\r\n\r\n&gt; As you may have noticed, Ericsson hasn’t done the best PR for Erlang. The closest things resembling sales pitches I see from that part of the world are either **academic-looking papers** or PowerPoint presentations that require downloading heavy PDF files.\r\n\r\nTobbe replied:\r\n\r\n&gt; That programming in Erlang is fun was one important message that we tried to get through when we at Ericsson’s CSLab gave internal courses to Ericsson personel. But boy what a hard work that was. I recommend **Bjarne Decker’s Thesis** as an interesting read on the topic.\r\n\r\nComedy. Freaking.

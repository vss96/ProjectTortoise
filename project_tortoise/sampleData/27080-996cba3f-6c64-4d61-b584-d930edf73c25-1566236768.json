Since lying on immigration forms is punishable by summary deportation, the point wasn't that you'd be stupid enough to (essentially) admit to it, but rather if you were found guilty of an ancillary crime (being a member of a terrorist organization), you could be plainly kicked out of the country instead of sent to the lockup in Joliet.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27080-996cba3f-6c64-4d61-b584-d930edf73c25-1566236768"}

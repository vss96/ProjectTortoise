Do you believe the mind is deterministic?\r\n\r\n(I'm actually more inclined to say that the laws of physics are a program that the universe interprets.  English text is tricky, because the same sentence can be interpreted many different ways, and produce many different behaviors.  Even the physics analogy may not hold, because of quantum mechanics.  Then again, quantum mechanics doesn't really make the *universe* non-deterministic, it just makes the outcome of any *measurement* non-deterministic.  Whether the universe exists apart from measurements is an interesting philosophical question.)","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ut6i","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808711,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nostrademons","edited":false,"id":"cv1mk","parent_id":"t1_cv1lr","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32643-a4957f53-5389-48fa-984a-4df7b4f2e6b3-1566236770"}

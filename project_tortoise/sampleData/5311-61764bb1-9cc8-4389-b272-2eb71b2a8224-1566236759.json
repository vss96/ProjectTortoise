The first is that most people are not aware they have the power.  The second is that recently judges have taken to misinforming jurors that they do not have the right.\r\n\r\nAs is noted in the Wikipedia article, jurors historically have had the right of nullification.  It is only a comparatively recent (and illegitimate) power grab attempt on the part of the courts and lawyers that has resulted in jurors not knowing of it.\r\n\r\nThe egos of many of those involved in the court system are immense and they do not want it generally recognized that they (the lawyers, judges, bailiffs, etc.) work **for** the jury in delivering justice.  They are much happier with the arrangement that the jury is merely a tool for determining the facts.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, the facts are already determined before the jury goes off to determine their decision.  The legal system has already decided what facts can and have been submitted (the evidence) so what role is there for the jury except to determine how to produce justice from those facts and the law, as has been argued by the lawyers under the refereeing eye of the judge to ensure that everything the jury sees and hears is on the up and up?","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5311-61764bb1-9cc8-4389-b272-2eb71b2a8224-1566236759"}

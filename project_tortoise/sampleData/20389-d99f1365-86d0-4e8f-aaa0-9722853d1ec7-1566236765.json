Hunting was a common pastime; to say nothing of self-defence; people of that day were jealous of their guns for various reasons.\r\n\r\nAnd I think you are too quick to say the military is too strong to resist.  There are many many more people who could rise up against the military than the military could throw against the people at large.  You simply cannot rule a people that does not wish to be ruled; no tyrant can match a public with a strong will, and which is well armed.  (To say nothing of the plain fact that at least several military commanders would not align themselves with a tyrant; their duty, indeed, would be to fight against such a tyrant, and there are many in the military throughout the ranks who value liberty very much.)\r\n\r\nThat said, your conclusion is a dreary one.  You say the government is too strong to resist, and so the natural solution is to increase its strength by weakening the people.  You seem to be saying almost that there is no point to defend liberty, so just abandon it and place your trust in the Almighty Government.  You assume that the only reason for the second amendment is this particular one, which is simply not true.  Self-defence is a big reason now to keep the right; as the article mentioned, despite the ban on guns, there is no shortage of guns in the district.  Your reasoning is specious and dangerous.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u9bd","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20389-d99f1365-86d0-4e8f-aaa0-9722853d1ec7-1566236765"}

What kind of argumentation is that?\r\n\r\nYour axiom that it's a good idea to stuff everything into one page does not hold true for the majority of web applications.  So discussing what it implies isn't worthwhile if you want to talk about approaches to building typical web applications.\r\n\r\n&gt; I agree that it might be a bad idea for *webmail*\r\n\r\nYes, which is the example being used to say that graceful degradation isn't feasible, which is the position I am arguing against.\r\n\r\n&gt; is it really that hard to imagine an application where it's not a bad idea?\r\n\r\nNo.  Which is why my position all along has been, and I quote:\r\n\r\n&gt; Now there are a few applications where this isn't possible. But that's when the functionality itself relies on JavaScript.\r\n\r\nThese types of web application are few and far between.  I'm not arguing that *all* web applications can be built this way, I'm arguing that *almost* all of them can.\r\n\r\n&gt; I'm just saying that there are plenty of situations where it doesn't\r\n\r\nHere's an exercise for you: how many web applications have you worked on?  How many of them required JavaScript to achieve their functionality (regardless of how you actually built them)?\r\n\r\nI've lost count of the number of web applications I've worked on, and in my experience, it's *extremely* rare to find a situation where JavaScript is required for functionality.  I don't think the stuff I've worked on is disproportionate to the rest of the industry.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tm90","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165336042,"score":0,"ups":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9171-4b0a19a6-3279-4656-9663-38eaf13f6ce3-1566236761"}

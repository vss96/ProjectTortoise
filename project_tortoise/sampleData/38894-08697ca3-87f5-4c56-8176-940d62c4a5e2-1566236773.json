Especially given the difficulty of making economic predictions more than a year out.\r\n\r\n2) These figures of a few trillion are actually the differences between expected taxes and expected expenses which are each in the 10--30 trillion range. For example, if you look at the [financial statement](http://fms.treas.gov/fr/06frusg/06stmt.pdf), you find that the SS program has an expected revenue with a present value of  32.1 trillion, for all persons alive today (i.e., neglecting workers yet to be born who will be earning wages to pay for the retirement of 30-year-olds today), compared against expected expenditures of 38.6 trillion in present value. I.e. the net liability is around 20%. We cut everyone's social security checks by 20%, or raise social security taxes by 20% (e.g. from approximately 16% of payroll to something like 19% of payroll), or some mix of the two, problem solved.\r\n\r\nInstead, right-wingers shout \"oh my, trillions of dollars out of balance, better kill it now!\"","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v8uv","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38894-08697ca3-87f5-4c56-8176-940d62c4a5e2-1566236773"}

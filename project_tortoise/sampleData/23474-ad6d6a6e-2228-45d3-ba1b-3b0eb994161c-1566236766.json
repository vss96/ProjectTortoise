The problem and solution spaces are infinite, so why are we crying about making a measly buck for every pitiful piece of code? Our children's children will guffaw when they read that we actually had to buy software to make our computers boot, or to make a document. Our grandkids will all be programmers, making things that will blow us away with their power and elegance. But they won't call it \"programming\". They will call it \"using the computer\". If we can cut out all the bullshit, this is what Free Software will accomplish. Science is \"standing on the shoulders of giants\". Software should be in the same vein.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uhet","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808342,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"drosser","parent_id":"t3_uhet","id":"cuhwe","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23474-ad6d6a6e-2228-45d3-ba1b-3b0eb994161c-1566236766"}

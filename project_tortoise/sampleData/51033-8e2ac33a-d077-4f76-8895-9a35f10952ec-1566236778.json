Helma is similar to RoR in many ways, but the most attractive feature for java developers is that all Java packages can be used within natively.\r\n\r\nAs a web startup entrepreneur I have looked at different web frameworks to asses which one will give a small startup the leverage. It comes down to RoR and Helma.   Keep in mind this is for WEB development.  I decided to go with Helma for 3 simple reasons, \r\n\r\n1. Scalabilities/performance. \r\n2. Ease of maintenance (upgrading JRE is consistent and easy). \r\n3. Built-in thread based cronjobs. (This becomes very important when many features of my business are cron based).\r\n\r\nHere is longer list of good reasons to use Helma listed by  Michael Platzer\r\nhttp://adele.helma.org/download/helma/documentation/documentation.html#IntroWhyHelma\r\n\r\nWhen I have time I will come up with a more detail list of pros and cons of Helma in relation to RoR. \r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0ju","subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167136119,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51033-8e2ac33a-d077-4f76-8895-9a35f10952ec-1566236778"}

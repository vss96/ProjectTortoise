But, I'm just the humble wife of a geek who put some adblocking thing on my computer.  \r\n\r\nAs to Phia - I hear your concerns.  And quite honestly - this plan looks like it will take a minimum of seven years to implement.  I posted it because it made me hopeful. It seems as if people are really waking up to what the proper education of our children needs to be in order to survive in a global market.   \r\n\r\nI still plan to home educate my lastborn child.  I don't think I'll choose to participate in the experiment during its transitional years. (Probably about 7 to 20.) But - they seem to be discussing the implementation of many skill sets  which are critical reasons I choose to home educate. \r\n\r\nWhat they are discussing is what I do everyday at home with my own children.  If they manage to do it, I actually look forward to my grandchildren attending these schools, so that my children don't have to choose whether or not to invest in a family or personal career.  One day, schools might be good enough for parents to have all and every professional option available to them.  (Doubt it.)  But, a close proximity would be nice.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_whie","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59297-695826e5-d7fd-4e93-8dbb-dd4dbb7d3d46-1566236780"}

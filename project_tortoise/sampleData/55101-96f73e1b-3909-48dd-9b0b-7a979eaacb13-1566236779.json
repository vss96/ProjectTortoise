{"controversiality":0,"body":"UK governments have been meddling with the health service for a long time now, privatising from the edges, making cuts while employing new layers of management who spend their days dreaming up makework schemes for themselves and diverting resources from actual healthcare. It is no surprise to anyone with any inside knowledge of the system that it is overstretched - yet we still see joe public moaning about what service there still is, whilst demanding lower taxes. The actual care when you get to see a doctor is generally excellent, the problem is waiting to see that doctor as you've experienced - but still you prefer to blame doctors personally rather than a lack of resources.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8i3","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167324092,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"author":"chu","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cw969","edited":false,"id":"cw9iq","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809548,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55101-96f73e1b-3909-48dd-9b0b-7a979eaacb13-1566236779"}

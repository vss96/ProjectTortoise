To try to encapsulate his response, I would say that he's decided that ignoring religion, giving it special respect/license, and taking the meek approach has been insufficient. There are fundamental misunderstandings among the lay people about the nature of science, and these misunderstandings are being perpetuated and exploited by religious fundamentalists. \r\n\r\nSo although you may find him self-righteous, Dawkins comes across to me as brave and honorable.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167335480,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"science","id":"cwa48","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvxqw","author_flair_text":null,"author":"ewokjedi","retrieved_on":1473809560,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55393-9b225ab8-4e09-4cce-a1ee-012bb71d66e2-1566236779"}

If you assume that a height of six feet represents the average income in that year, [...] the guy at the extreme right, he towers over the line at more than 113 feet.\r\n\r\n&gt; Now take 2005. [...] The guy at the end of the line is now 560 feet tall, almost five times taller than his 1973 counterpart.\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to explain how taxation is an important factor in all of this.  But the numbers just don't add up - not even nearly.\r\n\r\nSuppose in 1973 the super rich was paying 50% in tax, but in 2005 that was reduced to 20%.  That would only correspond to 40% extra take-home-pay.  Nothing like the 5-fold increase mentioned.\r\n\r\nOf course I'm not saying the tax reduction is a good thing or anything like that - just that one should be aware that it is a long long way off explaining the data.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_unoz","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27041-e30dda1c-2254-4269-9f4c-a10ec4a2ef95-1566236768"}

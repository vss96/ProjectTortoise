{"body":"&gt; E.g. this Swedish guy looks to be in some trouble now.\r\n\r\nThat article doesn't indicate that he's in legal trouble. If he stands to lose his teaching job, that's fine by me: I wouldn't want that guy teaching my kids history in a public school, just like I wouldn't want a creationist teaching them biology.\r\n\r\n&gt; There was a famous case with an American Gary Lauck\r\n\r\nThe acts for which he was extradited and tried took place in Germany, where they are clearly illegal. This seems to be a case related to Danish extradition policy rather than the legality of Holocaust denial in Denmark.\r\n\r\nThere are several neo-Nazi and hardcore nationalist groups in Denmark; they are legal.\r\n\r\nHolocaust denial, in particular, is a protected form of expression, but other forms of speech are not. Example: Some of these neo-Nazi groups run licensed radio stations. A few years ago one of their hosts incited the station's listeners to go out and kill all Muslims. This is illegal in Denmark, and the outcome was that the station and host were fined.\r\n\r\nEdit: In this and my previous message, I was not trying to argue that certain European countries are more free than the US when it comes to speech; I was correcting specific errors or misconceptions.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vqjl","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166833254,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"psykotic","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvssd","edited":false,"id":"cvsut","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809232,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46508-fdabdb48-85b5-45f3-965a-9b4aa68955fc-1566236775"}

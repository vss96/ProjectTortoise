I happen to have TAPL with me, so I'll supply you with some definitions:\r\n\r\n    true t f = t\r\n    false t f = f\r\n    if pred conseq alt = pred conseq alt\r\n    and a b = a b false\r\n    or a b = a true b\r\n    not a = a false true\r\n\r\nBasically, true and false become functions that return their first and second arguments, respectively.  `If` just applies its predicate to its two arguments - so `if x (print \"yes\") (print \"no\")` returns `(print \"yes\")` if x is true and `(print \"no\")` otherwise.  Working out and/or/not is left as an exercise to the reader - I had to work it out myself, no reason why you shouldn't too. :-P","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166211327,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31204-cc389b01-05bd-4ca9-880b-229c5561d2b4-1566236769"}

{"body":"I'm in two minds. I have a bad feeling that this might make some people start posting every chapter of every good online book out there, which would suck. But while I did read halfway through *Practical Common Lisp*, I never made it to this chapter, and I'm glad it got posted as it's quite interesting. I guess what tips the scale in this case is that its content -- advanced problem handling schemes beyond those of most common languages -- is something that would probably be interesting to lots of people, not just those who would be reading the book anyway (unlike, say, its preceding chapter, \"A Few FORMAT Recipes\" which only those people would care about).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_teza","subreddit":"programming","score":6,"ups":6,"created_utc":1165137035,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"ctfih","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctfht","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807622,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4701-a74967c8-4fb9-4b90-a238-35073167cb78-1566236759"}

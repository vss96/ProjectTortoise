You would receive \r\nthis in your heart just the same as you would if three old ladies came on board and couldn't get their luggage in the overhead rack? \r\n\r\nLets take it further.  Lets say the imams pray and do the whole bit and no one takes any notice...then lets say something terrible DOES happen on the flight.  Now, don't hide behind the admittedly \"small liklihood of this happening\" argument because the point Im making isn't about muslims its about people's *real* reaction to perceived threat and what they're willing to own up to consequently. \r\n\r\nSo now we've got conspicious muslims boarding a plane and some horrible event ensues.  Under *those* circumstances, with perfect knowledge of how events unfold, are you going to praise airport personel and police for not over reaching?\r\nThe police couldn't have known what was going to ensue so \r\nfrom their perspective, with your approach, its an overreaction on their part either way because their knowledge is imcomplete.   If someone subsuquently admits to having some anxiety over the behavior of the imams before boarding but didn't express it are you going to laud that persons inaction as rational?  Seems like you have to given the corner your in.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v7ee","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-3,"ups":-3,"created_utc":1166481542,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36984-4ff1ec5c-5fa9-4217-af82-10cb2ab86ffe-1566236772"}

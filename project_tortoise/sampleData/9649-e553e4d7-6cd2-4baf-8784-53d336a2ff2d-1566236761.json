[One company](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WFMI) sells about $5.5 billion worth each year -- and [would probably be selling even more if they didn't give away 5% of their profits to charity](http://www.reason.com/0510/fe.mf.rethinking.shtml) (reason.com seems to be down, but it's a great article).\r\n\r\nI think it's a matter of location. I *know* it's a matter of location; my neighborhood grocery store probably reduces the local life expectancy half a decade with all their cigarettes, cheap alcohol, and fried/snack foods. But there are better places within walking distance -- so when I'm desperate for organic veggies and soy stuff, I take walk and buy what I need. The fact that it's less convenient doesn't mean it's totally inaccesible -- and I imagine that most of the Foodtown customers are at least vaguely aware of the existence of D'Agostino's a subway stop or two away. It's not that hard; the people who don't take advantange of it aren't thinking very far ahead, and they'll suffer for it eventually.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, you could argue that it's our obligation to do their thinking for them -- but that's paternalistic, demeaning, and shortsighted. Giving them *even less* reason to plan ahead isn't going to encourage them. It's just passing off the same old problem to the next generation of well-meaning redditors and their myopic wards.","created_utc":1165347440,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_ctqgv","edited":false,"id":"ctqjo","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","retrieved_on":1473807828,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9649-e553e4d7-6cd2-4baf-8784-53d336a2ff2d-1566236761"}

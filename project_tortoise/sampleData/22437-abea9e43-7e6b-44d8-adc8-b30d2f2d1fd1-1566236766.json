You can easily eat the same amount of fat in other types of foods and not barf.  It's quite easy to match that amount of fat in a home-made meal if there is any frying going on, especially if you add dessert and/or salad dressing.  I'll use some standardized foods though:\r\n\r\nFor example, a gallon of low-fat milk (2%), the most popular type, has about 77 grams of fat.  You can exceed this with two Big Macs and a salad with nothing but lettuce and creamy Caesar dressing (total: 78g) from McDonald's.  Or, a Big Mac, large fries, and a 21 oz shake (78 g).  Or, a double quarter pounder with cheese, large fries, and a McDonaldland cookies (78g).  Many people on here could eat this amount of food in a sitting easily, yet would still barf from too much milk.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, hardly anyone can actually chug the whole gallon without barfing; they usually get sick part way through, so they don't even take in the whole amount of fat.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mcdonalds.com/app_controller.nutrition.index1.html\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808305,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cug0x","parent_id":"t1_cueee","author":"lemmikins","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22437-abea9e43-7e6b-44d8-adc8-b30d2f2d1fd1-1566236766"}

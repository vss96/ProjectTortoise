{"body":"Boogety boogety boo!  It's a vast conspiracy!  They're all out to get you!  \r\n\r\nVast conspiracies are impossible because the more people are involved then the more likely it is that someone will want to expose the conspiracy and or the more likely it is that someone will make a mistake and let the secret slip out into the light.  You'll forgive me if I don't believe some guy when he says someone else reported information to him, that he doesn't quite know the nature of, and which he cant even tell us the hint that he's basing his claim about right now, which involves a project that's worked on by a huge number of people in a mostly transparent project, etc.  It's just as important to be skeptical of people who tell you that everything is not what it seems as it is to be skeptical of those who say that it is.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vyxb","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1167056533,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"breakneckridge","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_vyxb","edited":false,"id":"cvzee","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809355,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49753-c2ca1cd9-a09a-4449-9b5a-62779c7ff878-1566236777"}

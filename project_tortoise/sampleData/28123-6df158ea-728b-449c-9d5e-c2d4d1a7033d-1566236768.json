And the cure was invariably for them to get kicked in the head by a horse again, which happened at minute 26 of a half-hour show, or minute 52 of an hour.  Then I grew up and learned those stories were ridiculous and without the slightest basis in fact.\r\n\r\nNow I've read this article, and I don't know what to believe.  I'm going to buy a horse and tour the country, healing the sick, until I get arrested.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_upf8","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808527,"distinguished":null,"author":"rhebert","author_flair_text":null,"id":"curwi","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_upf8","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28123-6df158ea-728b-449c-9d5e-c2d4d1a7033d-1566236768"}

My reading of the chapter suggest he's making a clear distinction between \"the dead,\" ie everyone who has ever died, and \"Christ,\" who even the Corinthians believed had risen.  He says at least twice, that if \"the dead\" don't rise, then even Christ didn't rise.  Which is awfully repetitive even for Paul if \"the dead\" and Christ mean the same thing.  If, on the other hand, he's trying to convince them that, like Christ, all dead will rise, then his statements make sense.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to assert that \"baptized for the dead\" is a figurative expression (which is supported by Paul's claim of daily death later in that chapter) then I won't argue with that, but I don't think \"the dead\" is referring to a single person.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vfhl","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40901-9b86a510-d72d-454d-b8ea-3aeb9ff0b5c9-1566236773"}

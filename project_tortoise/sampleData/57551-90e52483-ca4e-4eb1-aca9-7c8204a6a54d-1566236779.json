You don't ask someone to fix your sink, or paint your house for free, and tell them it will be good experience, that they can put it into their portfolio - that's ridiculous.\r\n\r\nWeb design is so cheapened, because crap web work can cost from nothing, to almost nothing, and business people will choose to spend zero, and get a crap web site, rather than spending a lot, getting a great site.\r\n\r\nTruly a result of all the nieces and nephews who they know that can build a site in a day, using Frontpage or something or other. It seems most people see no difference between professional and amateur designers - to them, a site is a site, and quality is of no real importance.\r\n\r\nAlthough...I believe it is these cheap customers that are the most demanding, making ridiculous design requests, that, ironically, you'll never want to put into your portfolio.\r\n\r\nI recall a time when I was asked to do a site, but the person withdrew after \"realising\" they can just make it themselves! Open up Frontpage, drag some pics and text around, and viola - web design is so easy! (Of course it sucked so incredibly badly, they seemed blind to the fact.)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wcjz","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167427934,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57551-90e52483-ca4e-4eb1-aca9-7c8204a6a54d-1566236779"}

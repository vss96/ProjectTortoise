The other side of this is service workers that provide atrocious service.  I say hello to the bus drivers in my area also; it ended up getting me a job with the transit authority a few years ago!  But on the other hand, whenever I go to Wendy's to get a hamburger, I swear, the lady behind the counter might as well be putting voodoo curses on me out loud, because her body language, attitude, and general foreigner-ness shout \"die, white guy\".  I like hamburgers sans spit, so I deal with it.  But one day, I want to tell her to crawl back under the rock she came from if she wants to act like a troll.  Ironically my local McDonald's staff actually does seem to love to see me smile.","link_id":"t3_upgw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808532,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"MMX","edited":false,"id":"cus7q","parent_id":"t1_cur8o","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28276-81351646-5f45-4612-a79d-7459d7e7a358-1566236768"}

The body count is from the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. Satan is just an insignificant figure in these books - basically a court jester by Gods throne. Only later did the Hebrews - inspired by persian religion - adopt the dualistic wold view with the forces of good battling the forces of evil, and Satan got elevated to the cosmologically much more important position as King of Evil. Thats why Satan is much more important in the New Testament than the Old, and even more important in medieval theology.","retrieved_on":1473809351,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvz56","parent_id":"t3_vw33","author_flair_text":null,"author":"olavk","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49655-dc886477-c669-4c15-aa13-0f8a613dacc8-1566236777"}

It comes from kings (who took power by force) granting rights to their allies. It offers enough advantages so that people want to justify it by pretending that it's based on agreement, but that doesn't make it so.\r\n\r\nEven with that fantasy history, though, you'd still have to content with those who *don't* agree, and so force is necessary. Your talk of the abolition of power is *exactly* the same as naive Marxists' talk of really free people coming from the withering of the state.\r\n\r\nLiberty and prosperity are supported by systems that *withstand* human lust for power, not by ideologies that pretend that lust can be finessed out of existence.\r\n\r\nRadical economic libertarianism is a stalking horse for plutocratic totalitarianism, just as Marxism was a stalking horse for state-capitalist totalitarianism.\r\n\r\nEDIT: And I'm sure you don't think you're representing a stalking horse for anything and you're offended by my saying so, just as the Marxists I knew when I was young thought they were saving the world and were offended by my pointing out the unintended consequences of *their* utopian ideology.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808729,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cv2lq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv2kr","author":"BarkingIguana","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33154-8d9bfd8c-2279-497d-ab1c-e517fb8940cd-1566236770"}

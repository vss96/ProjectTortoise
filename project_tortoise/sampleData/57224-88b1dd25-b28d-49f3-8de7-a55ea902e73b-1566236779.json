So that would include a situation in which there was consensual sex for both participants but it was never verbalized. You may argue that that's not innocent, but I think it's also pretty clearly not  a rape.  \r\n\r\nI think we need to be sure our laws don't unfairly punish those who reasonably thought their partner was consenting. At the very least, we should not allow a non-violent error in judgement to carry the same penalty as a sadistic, deliberate rape. \r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wa4w","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809629,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ewokjedi","edited":false,"id":"cwdtb","parent_id":"t1_cwb41","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57224-88b1dd25-b28d-49f3-8de7-a55ea902e73b-1566236779"}

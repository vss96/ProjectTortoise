We feed corn to our poultry.  Highly processed corn sweeteners have replaced cane-based sugar in just about all snack foods and drinks.  Corn is the basis for a large amount of \"natural and artificial flavors\". (Who knew that \"natural raspberry flavor\" was made from corn?)  Corn is the common thread to all the cheap stuff on that chart. And corn is what's *not* in the expensive side.\r\n\r\nEverything else got more expensive because corn is pushing it out of local production.  The drive to make more money on cheaper and cheaper corn has caused middle-american farmers to remove all the variety from their land.  Now they just alternate between corn and soybeans.  Most fruits and vegetables travel *thousands of miles* to get to your local store.  A lot of it comes from other countries.  The other problem is that we want year-round access to fruits and vegetables, even when they are our of season locally.  Oranges in winter used to be a Christmas treat.  Recently I heard someone complaining at the supermarket that they can only get navel oranges, but not valencias which are better for juicing.\r\n\r\n","link_id":"t3_tol1","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165337281,"ups":19,"score":19,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9229-e04c6b4e-271a-489d-b569-3f4b45dd1261-1566236761"}

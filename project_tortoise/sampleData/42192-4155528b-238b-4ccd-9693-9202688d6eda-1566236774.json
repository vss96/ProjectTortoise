Free-Will is not the CAUSE or SOURCE of an action, or even, as you point out, of a desire to act at all. It is the method by which such an action is chosen from the near infinite spectrum of possible actions. The fact that the action is not selected at random, or arbitrarily is not relevant, as long as it is not forced from the outside.\r\n\r\nI agree that freedom exists. I just don't like the term \"free will\" because it implies (at least to me) that my will is what's free. I view freedom as the capacity to do as I will not to will as I will (that's the part I find incoherent).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vf8l","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166660863,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42192-4155528b-238b-4ccd-9693-9202688d6eda-1566236774"}

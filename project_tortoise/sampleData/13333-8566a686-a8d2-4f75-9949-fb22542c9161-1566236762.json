It is only after having experienced such life that a base-line survival seems an adequate or desirable quality of life. And even when one has medicaid, government subsidized housing, food stamps, and welfare (all of which are half-assed attempts to provide the aforementioned) these individuals lack the education to actually do anything to better themselves. A high school diploma at a poor inner city school is worth little more than a grade-school diploma in a wealthier area - colleges know this, and admissions thus reflect it.\r\n\r\n*edit*: Of course it isn't as black and white as all of this, there will always be people who do not wish to better themselves, but one is a true cynic to believe that these people are not a small minority of mankind, when circumstance doesn't drive them to believe this.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13333-8566a686-a8d2-4f75-9949-fb22542c9161-1566236762"}

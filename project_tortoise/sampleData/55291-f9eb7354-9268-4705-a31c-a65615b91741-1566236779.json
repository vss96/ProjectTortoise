The modest dress you wear to go shopping in one country would be the lingerie of another. And 'she was asking for it!' is not a defensible position unless what she was saying was, in so many words 'Yes please!'\r\n\r\nHowever I do agree rape is about reproduction as well as power. Men may rape (and I suppose women, if they can) because they want the female and they don't care about her as a person, because they want to hurt her or because they want to hurt someone else.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w84v","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809555,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Phia","edited":false,"id":"cw9wy","parent_id":"t3_w84v","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55291-f9eb7354-9268-4705-a31c-a65615b91741-1566236779"}

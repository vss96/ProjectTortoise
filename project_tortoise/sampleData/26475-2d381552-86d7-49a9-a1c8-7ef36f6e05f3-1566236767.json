That means it costs the same amount to launch six ships a given distance from the lunar surface as it does to launch one from Earth.  Landings are similarly cheaper.  Factor in asteroid mining, life support research, even anti-matter experimentation, and a moon base makes good economic sense *if you're focused outward*.  If you're thinking inwardly, ie about Earth and its immediate environs, then a moonbase is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe meek can inherit the Earth.

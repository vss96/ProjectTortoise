To put it more seriously I think the deal with bittorrent.com came from the fact that they look at things like this through a certain filter. That filter says that when you want to employ a new content delivery mechanism you license it from someone.\r\n\r\nI'll also argue that they don't know what a protocol is, most people don't, i'm sure their technical consultants do and you could certainly explain it to them and they would grasp the concept.\r\n\r\nI was saying that they have consistently shown a lack of technical understanding in the past and this deal was a complete waste of time for the MPAA, my premise is that one caused the other.\r\n\r\nI was calling them stupid for making this unnecessary deal with cohen when it's not needed to use bittorrent. It's reasonable to want to use bittorrent to distribute movies, its a good idea to buy the rights to utorrent and rebrand it as your offical download client (if that's what they're doing).\r\n\r\nI also defend the concept of the MPAA going into a partnership with Tim Berners-Lee in order to put out a website. you can't say that's not funny.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165599820,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16458-0e0f669d-fc41-4292-9b41-856a48aa4506-1566236763"}

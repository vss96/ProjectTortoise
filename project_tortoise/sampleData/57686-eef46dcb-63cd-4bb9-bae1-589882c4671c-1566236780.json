Both of these work well in their respective fields, but cannot currently be combined. String theory is an attempt to combine them; however, Woit's point is that it does not predict any behavior that would not be predicted using QM and GE separately. So there's no way to falsify it, no test to see whether or not string theory is true.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57686-eef46dcb-63cd-4bb9-bae1-589882c4671c-1566236780"}

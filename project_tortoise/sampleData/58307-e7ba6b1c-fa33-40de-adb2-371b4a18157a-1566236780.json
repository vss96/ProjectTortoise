Most people don't associate PCs with servers.  I notice you avoid talking about how this has no effect on Tor clients.  Why would someone really want to identify a Tor server?  Tor servers are just proxies for services.  But by clearly avoiding that clarification, and muddying it throughout your site and paper, you are clearly making an attempt to try and state that Tor clients are not anonymous.\r\n\r\nI guess you are just trying to confuse in an effort to gain some notice to your paper.  Sorry, I didn't buy it and I don't think anyone else is either.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_waq3","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58307-e7ba6b1c-fa33-40de-adb2-371b4a18157a-1566236780"}

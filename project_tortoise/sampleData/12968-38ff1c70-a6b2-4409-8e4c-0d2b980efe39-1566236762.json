{"body":"\"You understand neither religion, nor atheism\"\r\nA rather arrogant and presumptious comment that's a tad self-satisfied - it strikes me as being delivered from someone who suffers a little with a superiority complex or super-ego. Going on about \"logical fallacy\" strikes me as someone who spends far too much time trying to come up with a 'novel' turn of phrase rather than reply in kind. I added this link and my comments with a huge tongue in my cheek. The site itself made amusing comments which, in my opinion, I just added to...thats all!  Which brings me back to your opening comment \"You understand neither religion, nor atheism\".... this self important aggrandizing of your reply is just grist to the mill of us \"secular humanists\".  Relax, take it easy - if you really want to judge your worth in forums than take it over to those at richarddawkins.net - see how you do there!","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tu1t","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1165457677,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"media_lush","edited":false,"id":"ctxcv","parent_id":"t1_ctuq9","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807954,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12968-38ff1c70-a6b2-4409-8e4c-0d2b980efe39-1566236762"}

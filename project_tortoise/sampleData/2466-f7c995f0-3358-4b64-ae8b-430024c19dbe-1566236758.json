{"body":"Half of his problems are solved on the Mac side, and others are just wrong. Let's Fisk:\r\n\r\n1. Numlocks. Fair enough, it's bullshit. That's why Mac doesn't have it.\r\n\r\n2. Caps lock. Mac has a system Preference to make it do something else (control, option, command).\r\n\r\n3. Multimedia keys. Mac's are the same from machine to machine and work consistently. \r\n\r\n4. US Keyboards. This is just wrong. _Some_ US keyboards have a small return, and some don't.\r\n\r\n5. Color. Whatever.\r\n\r\n6. Volume. Works on the Mac.\r\n\r\n7. Sleep. Ditto.\r\n8. Insert block. Not an issue.\r\n\r\n9. Legs. The Apple Pro keyboard has a sort of improved version of the legs. \r\n\r\n10. Function keys. Steve Jobs pointed out long ago that function keys shouldn't really exist per se, and Mac apps generally don't use them.\r\n\r\n11. F Lock. Nope.\r\n\r\n12. Wireless. Why not? It's not mandatory. It's just something some people like.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t9c9","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165017860,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"earthboundkid","id":"ctaor","parent_id":"t3_t9c9","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807530,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2466-f7c995f0-3358-4b64-ae8b-430024c19dbe-1566236758"}

I'm pretty sure that's a gross over-exaggeration. In SOME areas of China, especially the wealthier farming communities near Anhui and Shanghai, the ratio is 120:100 males to females at birth.  But according to Wikipedia, the ratio for the country at birth is 1.12:1, and at 15-64 is  1.06 to 1. You can compare this to the United States is you want; it's more males than us, but certainly not 2:1. Just because Orson Scott Card said it doesn't make it true.\r\n\r\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_united_states#Miscellaneous_statistics\r\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_mainland_China","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38667-1792bb7c-c7bd-48cc-b68d-134c9a751cd5-1566236773"}

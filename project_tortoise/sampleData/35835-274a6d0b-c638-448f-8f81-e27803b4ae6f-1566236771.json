Are we interested in the truth? Or are we interested in believing in things that make us happy? I like taking the example of gravity. You can believe or disbelieve in it all you like, but it can be seen acting *always*, it'll *always* exist. Unlike a god, who cannot be seen acting and who people attribute things to. You want to apply the scientific method to God, or gods? Create an enclosed environment and coax it to perform some kind of act with no human interference whatsoever, for example a goat sacrifice ;) If a god can't do something simple like that, what kind of god are they??\r\n\r\nAlso, having a God exist makes the universe infinitely more complicated than it already is. It raises questions such as who made God? What kind of universal laws apply to God? What is God made of? WAY too complicated. Especially when you can't even see the damn thing and measure any of it accurately.\r\n\r\nAtheists haven't stood up for themselves enough. Notice how  this kid is being singled out? I get the impression that highschool is going to really suck for this kid. Now *that* is much worse than anything an atheist can dish out. Oh and that feeling of superiority? Well, lots of evidence for scientific theories like evolution can do that to you.\r\n\r\n...But the rest of your point: agreed.\r\n\r\n*I hope that was somewhat coherent, I need another coffee...*","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35835-274a6d0b-c638-448f-8f81-e27803b4ae6f-1566236771"}

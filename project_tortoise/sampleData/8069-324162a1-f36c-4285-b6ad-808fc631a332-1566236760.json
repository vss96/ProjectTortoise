Seriously though, I never said \"being a porn star is somehow beneath the spectrum of social acceptability.\"  I merely stated what I did as a fact, much like \"if you encourage your child to study hard he may grow up to be a doctor.\"  I also never said an absentee father exlusively causes this, though I think it's a major contributing factor.  \r\n\r\n\"Not all children/girls who grew up without a father turn into porn stars, or end up on drugs, or other bad things.\"  I said these girls *might* get into porn, not that all would.  If you throw a cat off a roof, it *might* die, but I'm sure many have survived such treatment.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8069-324162a1-f36c-4285-b6ad-808fc631a332-1566236760"}

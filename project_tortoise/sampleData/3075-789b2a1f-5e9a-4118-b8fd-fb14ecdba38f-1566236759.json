The ELF specifically attempts to \"inflict maximum economic damage on those profiting from the destruction and exploitation of the natural environment.\" Compare this to the statement quoted in the article: \"if you work for the murderous abortionist, Iâ€™m going to kill you.\"\r\n\r\nEconomic damage vs. murder. And yet I've heard more about the former in the news. The biggest difference is that the anti-abortion terrorists have a large group supporting them in spirit if not in action (the religious right), whereas there are far fewer hard-core environmentalists, with far less political support in general.\r\n\r\nAll this being said, I wonder how her list of incidents since 1977 would compare to lists of other criminal sources. A list of mafia-related crimes, a list of actual \"Arab/Muslim\" terrorism incidents (excluding 9/11), as well as a list of \"eco-terror\" incidents would tell us how relatively dangerous these Christian zealots truly are.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tb3y","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3075-789b2a1f-5e9a-4118-b8fd-fb14ecdba38f-1566236759"}

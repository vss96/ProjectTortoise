Until that time, your theory is at best just philosophy.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vb4k","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809105,"distinguished":null,"author":"acrophobia","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvm3g","id":"cvm8f","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43045-47b8ddaf-cf33-40a6-845e-9eb3dc0d0621-1566236774"}

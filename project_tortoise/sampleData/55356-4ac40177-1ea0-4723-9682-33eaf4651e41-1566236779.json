The question seems to assume that our sexual desires are always consciously tied to the goal of reproduction and this clearly isn't the case as evidenced by voluntary homosexual acts between willing male partners. Men raping men is merely a manifestation of this same mapping of male sexual desire onto male targets rather than female ones except that in the case of male-on-male rape one party is not consenting. Even in consensual heterosexual acts we are not usually consciously seeking reproduction but rather are seeking relief from horniness.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of it is that horniness is an evolutionarily acquired means of ensuring reproduction, however, the targeting system is sometimes faulty within a certain frequency of the population and is not always coupled with a target that is consistent with the goal of reproduction hence the phenomena of homosexuality, male-on-male rape, raping of females of non-reproductive age, necrophilia etc. I don't think any of this disproves the authors' hypothesis which is basically that men rape because they are horny and unable to obtain a willing partner within their group of desired targets. It is worth noticing that this covers men who can get laid - just not with the women or first-tier targets of choice, for example: a guy can get an ugly girl but not the pretty one he really wants so he rapes her instead.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55356-4ac40177-1ea0-4723-9682-33eaf4651e41-1566236779"}

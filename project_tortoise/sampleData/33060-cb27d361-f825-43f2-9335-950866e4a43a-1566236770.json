Sorry but can you explain the '...but there's no way to have that find of flexibility in Java...' bit. I guess you are talking about the mixin? From the code above I can not see the 'missing flexibility' that you mention.\r\n\r\nI regards the less code, that in general is a good thing but an interesting part of the Java code is its fairly close match to bytecode which I'd say is not always a bad thing.\r\n\r\nThanks, Rob.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_utqb","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166315308,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33060-cb27d361-f825-43f2-9335-950866e4a43a-1566236770"}

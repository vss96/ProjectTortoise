Obviously, evolution is a highly sophisticated process, which results in very profound \"creations\".  If one understands the mechanisms of evolution, one sees that this is done entirely without consciousness or intelligence.  If you want to call it \"non-dumb\" because of its amazing emergent properties, that's fine (and I'm sure Dawkins would agree with you), but that's very different from it being manifested of consciousness, intelligence, or design.","link_id":"t3_vx5n","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166993320,"score":5,"ups":5,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48961-42f8d095-49c7-4aa5-b8f7-ccfb25e41d57-1566236777"}

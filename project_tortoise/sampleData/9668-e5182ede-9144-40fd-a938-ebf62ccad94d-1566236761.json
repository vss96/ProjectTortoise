Coulter's campaigning against sex and violence in entertainment, but (as mentioned) poses suggestively on her book (and enjoys ... shudder ... sex symbol status in the Right).  Pastor Ted's blatant (and not completely shocking) hypocrisy.  Or the frequent and embarrassing flip-flopping among many in the left.\r\n\r\nCoulter's job is to move paper and sell ad time.  I doubt she entered punditry believing half the things she purports to believe now and, of those things that she does \"believe\" now that she had not, she's probably convinced herself into believing it because she's making so much damned money.  \r\n\r\nPolitics isn't about a person with innovative or superior ideals being put into a position to change the country, it's about being paid money to fit yourself into affirming the beliefs of others.  A shill.  Nothing new, *Mr. Smith...* (idealistically and optimistically) gave this treatment but sad nevertheless.\r\n\r\nThis should me more about dollars and cents than Coulter going Godwin on us.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165348129,"ups":18,"score":18,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9668-e5182ede-9144-40fd-a938-ebf62ccad94d-1566236761"}

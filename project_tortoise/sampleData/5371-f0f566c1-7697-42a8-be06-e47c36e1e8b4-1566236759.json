That is to say you cannot accept pay for a service that is offered under the public system UNLESS the ONLY patients you take are privately.  So if you chose to run privately then you cannot accept money from the public system.  This places most physicians in the public system because nobody wants to pay for services themselves that are already covered by the government... that and private health insurance was outlawed with the expection of services not covered by the government.  The Quebec ruling changed all of this, allowing citizens to pay for private health insurance giving them the option of being insured for a private clinic... the question is whether offering private insurance will result in two teired healthcare (although many already argue that two teired healthcare already exists ie. drugs, dental work, elective procedures)","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807654,"gilded":0,"id":"cth7q","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctg6k","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5371-f0f566c1-7697-42a8-be06-e47c36e1e8b4-1566236759"}

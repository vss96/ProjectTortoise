Because there is no penalty for posting dupes, in fact there is a potential reward in being the one copy of a story to \"take off,\" there is no motivation for users to check for dupes  before submitting.\r\n\r\nThis leads, in some cases, to seeing duplicates of 4 or 5 of the stories from the hot page on the new page also, posted moments ago, benefiting no-one.  Comments like [these](http://reddit.com/info/tn1o/comments/ctuk2) in which people berate others for pointing out duplicates add to the perception that there's nothing \"wrong\" with duplicates, but rather that there's something wrong with pointing them out.\r\n\r\nKarma whores post duplicates in case theirs happens to \"take off.\"  More people on the site are beginning to compete for points rather than trying to participate in a value-adding community.  Therefore Reddit is becoming less of a value, and more of a nuisance.\r\n\r\nCongratulations, [CalvinR](http://reddit.com/info/tn1o/comments/ctuk2), you're managing to help screw up a good thing.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvui","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807932,"author":"souldrift","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctw3y","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tvui","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12421-678c3085-28c1-402a-8ed8-0090485f757e-1566236762"}

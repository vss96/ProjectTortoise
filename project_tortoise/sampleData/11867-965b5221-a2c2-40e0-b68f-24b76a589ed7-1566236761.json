{"body":"This is a terrible article. The story about 9/11 is utterly false, to begin with. And claiming this author has a friggin clue what happened on that plane is also provably false, she wasn't there.\r\n\r\nPrayer, five times a day, is the practice of Muslims. The author stupidly alleges they turned the airport into a \"stage\". Get a grip girl, you're friggin clueless.\r\n\r\nThis article supports racism, xenophobia and religious discrimination.  Piss off Debra, you should research your facts a hell of a lot more before spouting off this kind of garbage.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the proof of the rest of the allegations she has made.\r\n\r\nAnd she's dead wrong about leaving our civil rights that boarding gate. Civil rights are *not* subject to private enterprises and their interpretations.  Many businesses have in fact tried this and have had their asses sued off, successfully.\r\n\r\nThe allegations that these Muslims were \"problem passengers\" is conjecture, created from biased and fearful interpretation of events.\r\n\r\nDoesn't it occur to anyone, that if these Imams *wanted* this response, then that is **exactly** what they were given on a silver platter? Which means, if this is true, then the airline and the passengers played right into their alleged \"plot\", which has created more fear, more hysteria, more media coverage, more anger, more cause for claims of discrimination, ad naseum.\r\n\r\nIf people stopped their stupid knee-jerk reactions to this kind of baseless fear-mongering, then they would not be empowering those that engage in it (on both sides of the fence).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tuya","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165427737,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lifeofliberty","id":"ctv1q","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tuya","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807913,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11867-965b5221-a2c2-40e0-b68f-24b76a589ed7-1566236761"}

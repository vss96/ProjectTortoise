{"body":"Exactly. Notice how Graham never shows his own paintings. Someone who claims to be a painter shouldn't make his aesthetic argument in writing, he should make it in a painting. Time to put up or shut up, Graham. You're either a painter, or someone who rants about painting. I've seen plenty of art school burnouts like Graham that can rant about painting, but none of them actually paint.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ufsk","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165898550,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"nmrk","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuizv","parent_id":"t1_cui2w","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808362,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24074-126556e5-9e43-48fe-beb8-169dcb3bc3e0-1566236767"}

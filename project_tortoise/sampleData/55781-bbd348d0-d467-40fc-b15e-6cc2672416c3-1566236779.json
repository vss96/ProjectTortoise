{"controversiality":1,"body":"&gt; Bribery is a crime implying a sum or gift given alters the behavior of the person in ways not consistent with the duties of that person. It is defined by Black's Law Dictionary as the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of any item of value to influence the actions as an official or other person in discharge of a public or legal duty.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribe\r\n\r\nThe fact that an item changes hands alone does not make it a bribe. To call it a bribe in this context there has to be an agreement for the reviewer to do something unethical. Writing a review isnâ€™t unethical unless it contains falsehoods. \r\n\r\nThe appearance of impropriety, while important to avoid, is not unethical.\r\n\r\nSo again I ask, what makes it unethical?\r\n\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wa4q","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167347803,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":-1,"score":-1,"author":"grauenwolf","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cwauq","id":"cwavl","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809574,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55781-bbd348d0-d467-40fc-b15e-6cc2672416c3-1566236779"}

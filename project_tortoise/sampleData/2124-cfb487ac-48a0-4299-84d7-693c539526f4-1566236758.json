This, of course, only compounds the problem and does nothing to lower real costs.\r\n\r\nSure when it comes to the costs at a hospital they are expensive for those reasons, but getting catastrophic hospital coverage is cheap compared to standard out patient visits along with a good drug prescription program.\r\n\r\nHere is the underlying problem with socialized or universal care if you prefer that:\r\n\r\n&gt; In all countries where health care is free at the point of consumption, demand rises. This is not surprising. Why would one not go to the doctor for a head cold when it costs nothing? Yet while this is not surprising, it is very damaging. The high demand for unnecessary care creates shortages, ending in long lines and waiting lists at the doctor’s office. It also diverts resources, as the hordes of free-riding patients rushing in with their trivial afflictions end up creating the need for doctors to address the trivial, at the expense of those few with real needs.\r\n\r\nEssentially you are further driving the reality of costs away from the consumer, in such places like cosmetic surgery it has proven to decrease when the consumer is footing the bill.  Same rule would apply if more and more people know what it cost them,.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent non-bias view towards fixing the problem.  I think both extreme view points should sit down and listen to what is being said here.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2124-cfb487ac-48a0-4299-84d7-693c539526f4-1566236758"}

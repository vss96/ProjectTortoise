While it's direct and unapologetically in disagreement with you, there's no intent of slight or sharp tone behind it.  That being the case, and knowing how easy it is to incorrectly attribute emotion to someone's text, I try to avoid such assumptions when at all reasonable to do so.  As such, I don't assume any intent other than a dry, factual tone (with perhaps a touch of facetiousness where appropriate) in the other two examples you cited.  I may be wrong, but I'd rather err on the side of not taking or giving offense.\r\n\r\nedit: By the way, upvoted you for honestly and directly addressing the potential misunderstanding.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_vdye","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809237,"author":"apotheon","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvt3q","parent_id":"t1_cvsgk","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46658-fbfa7726-1210-4497-bb56-152f16938520-1566236775"}

All that needs to happen to fix this particular problem is for the government to stop taxing in such a way that it's cheaper for companies to provide insurance instead of letting individual employees do it for themselves.  Companies are always trying to cut costs.  Blaming them for doing so is like blaming fish for swimming all the damn time.\r\n\r\nPlus, it's best if companies are allowed to hire or fire people *for whatever reason they want*.  If this company is excessively strict, they're going to suffer for it in the market.  I'm not arguing that firing this guy was a good decision, but more legislation won't fix the problem.\r\n\r\nIf anything, it's good that this case brings to light the problem with the tax structure for health insurance.  Most likely it's cheaper for the company to just fire smokers than to pay people enough to buy an equivalent amount of health insurance.  I just hope that people realize the root cause of the problem.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ufbm","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165866198,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23005-42985d32-1d55-460b-b91d-bfb15663ea99-1566236766"}

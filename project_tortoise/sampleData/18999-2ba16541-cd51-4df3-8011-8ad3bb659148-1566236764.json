In other words, he's confusing what a product does with its usability; this things are related, but not as directly as this makes it seem.  It is possible to design things that offer lots of features, but are intuitive and thus simple to use.  Of course, I would bet that the more features a product has, the more difficult it is for a designer to make an intuitve interface, but that's more of a different problem.  I think, for instance, this is why some people keep hoping for an Apple-designed phone: not because it won't have features, but because hopefully their designers could make them more easily useable.  \r\n\r\nCell phones are actually, in my opinion, a perfect example of this: features are added, and people like them; this is not a bad thing.  But only a few companies put any thought into usability; Motorola is probably the most infamous.  For an example of phones with a lot of usability and features, look at some of the older LG stuff, it always seemed to me to be of a quality at least slightly higher than their competitors.  Don't get me started on companies like Verizon who have decided on a standardized interface, which on its own is not a bad idea at all, but their design is so, so atrocious...","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u8mn","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18999-2ba16541-cd51-4df3-8011-8ad3bb659148-1566236764"}

I made a bad decision to change phone providers once, based on the information from a door to door salesman. Bad move that took months to fix. \r\n\r\nI almost bought a 4000 yuan small dragon from a \"seer\" at a \"temple\" in Beijing before I gained my senses. I also bought a $1500 2MP digital camera in 2000 right before prices plummeted. Then look at all those tourists who keep buying fake gems and cheap suits in Bangkok based on promises of shopkeepers. And of course, I used to have a television. \r\n\r\nAll these bad decisions usually don't harm people permanently. And I learned from my mistakes. But I can see how one bad decision might: we hear about the people who didn't read the fine print on an insurance policy, or work as mules carrying drugs across borders. Sometimes people just do the a wrong thing -- which seemed trivial to them -- until things go wrong. \r\n\r\nEveryone reacts differently to these stories, based on their own prejudices, and the \"victim's\" story. Discussion on Reddit is futile. There is just too little information to make worthwhile decisions on a forum. Instead of slactivism, go out and voluteer, make a donation, spread the word, or educate potential \"victims\" or whatever. Or if your conscience is clear, then go into the loans business, because it makes financial sense. \r\n\r\nMy personal preference to \"solving\" this PARTICULAR problem is via education, and not regulation. Since education penalises those who do not learn. While regulation keeps lawyers happy and creates more paperwork which just numbs the mind. \r\n\r\nJust my 2Â¢.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809355,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_vuk7","edited":false,"id":"cvzcl","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49733-59dd127e-33eb-42c8-bb64-ea4f95f7165e-1566236777"}

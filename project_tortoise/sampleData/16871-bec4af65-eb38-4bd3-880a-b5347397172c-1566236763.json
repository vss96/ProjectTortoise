I totally agree with anonygrl. I can (and often do) have \"sex\" with a different girl in a different way every night through internet porn sites. It's not suprising (and very sad) that sex with my girlfriend no longer has the same appeal. I wish I could get out of this habit, but porn is very addictive and I don't think many people realise what a problem it's causing until it's to late. I have friends who are going through the same. And 'no' mrcsparker it does not mean my friends are any the less interesting! I think it's an increasingly common problem affecting people from all walks of life.","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16871-bec4af65-eb38-4bd3-880a-b5347397172c-1566236763"}

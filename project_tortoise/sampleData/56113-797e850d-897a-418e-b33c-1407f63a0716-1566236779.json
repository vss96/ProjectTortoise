I really like Unix, but when people complain about Windows programs putting things all over the place I have to shrug.  Ever try to uninstall a program without a list of installed files / having used a package manager?  Or find some program if it's not in your path?  Or tried to select the proper icon for some program and end up looking in a bunch of places?  Listen, DLLS and the like are a pain, and it's likely much easier you can find a list of files to remove/add/change in open source projects, but Unix is a mess when it comes to this stuff too.\r\n\r\nHow I would love if all OSes migrated to self contained app folders like OS X... that's the way programs should run.  I'm surprised it's taken us this long to get there.","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167359903,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56113-797e850d-897a-418e-b33c-1407f63a0716-1566236779"}

I doubt that most of the people who are against this change want women to be raped.  They just think they should be the ultimate authority on whether a rape has occurred and what the punishment should be.  Which is not to say that this change shouldn't happen.  It's absolutely a good thing for a society to move beyond primitive tribal law.  It's just that this probably isn't about condoning rape, but rather preserving the established social order in parts of Pakistan.","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4457-a5aff038-de2e-4fe0-ae52-8afb2fcd0dce-1566236759"}

{"link_id":"t3_ufsk","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"I don't see how the essays shows that taste is not \"subjective\".  What's the problem with accepting that taste is subjective, but being all of the same species, we tend to share common grounds for basing our subjective judgements?  I also think that to deal with the issue of subjective taste in art fully, you have to explore the issue of the requirement to *learn* appreciation.  For instance, I cannot listen to a Beethoven symphony or Bach fugue without being almost mesmerised by its genius and beauty, whereas my wife can barely tolerate listening to it.  On the other hand, while I don't mind viewing the occasional artwork, she obviously has a true appreciation for it that will cause her a similar state of awe.  The main difference is in our backgrounds - I was brought up listening to classical music, and studied it all through school and university, whereas she has invested time into researching, understanding and appreciating the visual arts.  But I'm not sure you categorically prove that it's purely our backgrounds - and not something hard-wired into our nature, which would suggest that 'taste' has an essentially subjective element to it.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166047192,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_ufsk","id":"cup6y","edited":false,"author":"wizofaus","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808477,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26926-daf4130a-1c4a-4e2c-82d1-621ee5e7fd2a-1566236768"}

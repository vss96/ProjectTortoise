Others have said then that they were in danger... has litterature destroyed humanity? Not quite so.\r\n\r\nWhere I agree however is that many people (including myself I presume) may loose track of the World outside to a level where they'd rather spend time on that computer than talking to their friend. At some level this may be a limitation (can't find a better word) for them.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u0vn","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165566596,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":4,"score":4,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu391","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu2pf","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808065,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15605-96f97869-8cc7-46f8-a4ac-3f4460593de3-1566236763"}

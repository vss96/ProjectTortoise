{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tour","stickied":false,"controversiality":1,"body":"I agree with these comments.\r\nA thing that is lacking from Paul Graham's essays is that we don't NEED to aspire to wealth. All we need is basic food, shelter, healthcare and some entertainment. Its sick that people would aspire to reach the top 2%. Trying to earn big bucks by honest means in order to immediately spend it solving problems in the world for other people is great. But there's something profoundly wrong with accumulating helicopters, sports cars and condos in Aspen when others don't have enough to eat. \r\nI think Paul Graham's wealth, while I don't begrudge it, owes plenty to people that wrote freely available software in return for an average wage, CMUCL for example. Its insulting to those of us who write software for free with no thought of any gain, or any form of volunteer or person doing a poorly paid job out of duty/service, to bang on about how important it is to make sure people can create wealth. You can create forms of \"wealth\" by being nice to other people, planting trees, picking up litter, being a good friend to someone when they're dying of cancer. Its not all about chasing the almighty buck.","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165359301,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctrdu","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctqea","author_flair_text":null,"author":"nickthedart","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807844,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10104-9bc02c92-bd64-4070-8b40-498bcceccd73-1566236761"}

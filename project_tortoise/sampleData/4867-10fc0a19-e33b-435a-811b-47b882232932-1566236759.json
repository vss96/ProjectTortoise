All through training, one concept was hammered into you: Loud, repetetive verbal commands.  It's standard law enforcement training, and for the vast hordes of sheeple, it tends to work.  This is why, for instance on the taser videos, you see the cops shouting, \"Stop Resisting!\" over and over again while tasing people.  If you give sharp, clear, simple, repetitive commands (especially if you mix it up with 'pain compliance' methods, but it's not required), it creates a sense of panic and urgency, but at the same time, if you are loud, clear, and repetitive, that one thing - your message, basically, \"stop what you're doing and do what I tell you\" - becomes the only reasonable, stable, 'safe' thing in their minds.  Everything else is fear and panic, and so they will generally latch on to it and do what you say.  It goes against human nature to put a phone down while you are being spoken to, all the more so if the person on the other end is a policeman, and I'm sure that made it that much easier to get people to do what he wants.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165151678,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4867-10fc0a19-e33b-435a-811b-47b882232932-1566236759"}

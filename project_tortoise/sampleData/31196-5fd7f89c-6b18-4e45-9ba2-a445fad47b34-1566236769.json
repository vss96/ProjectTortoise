Chunk A contains stars and anything else whose inertia greatly exceeds its electrostatic interaction.  Chunk B contains gas and anything else for which electrostatic interaction dominates.  Observation shows unequivocally that chunk A pulls much more strongly gravitationally.\r\n\r\nSo either (a) gravity itself works differently for dust vs. stars, or (b) stars are 5-10 times heavier than we thought they were, or (c) there's other stuff there whose mass is much more important than its charge, but which doesn't shine brightly.\r\n\r\nI find (c) the most plausible.

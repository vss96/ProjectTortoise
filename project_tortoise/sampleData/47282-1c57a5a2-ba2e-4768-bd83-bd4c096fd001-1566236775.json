That's how you win the fight.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see a good central clearinghouse for Creative Commons'd/otherwise free music.  It's a losing battle to try to pry the music out of the hands of the $evil_conglomerate who owns it.  But like you say, they're on the wrong side of this, and time will bear that out.  It's just a question of how long until bands start figuring out that giving away their music makes sense and people start paying attention to bands that do.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'm not sure which will happen first -- whether illegal sharing will knock down the music industry with lawsuits left and right, bands will start releasing music for free independent of labels, or the present uneasy balance will continue for a decade or two.  It'll probably be some combination of all three.  \r\n\r\nBut for now, I'm just gonna keep giving away the digital portions of my work for free, making a living because of it, and encouraging others to do the same.","score":44,"ups":44,"created_utc":1166885721,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47282-1c57a5a2-ba2e-4768-bd83-bd4c096fd001-1566236775"}

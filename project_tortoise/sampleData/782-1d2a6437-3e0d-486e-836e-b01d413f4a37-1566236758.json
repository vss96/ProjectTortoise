I learned C#, Perl, Python, Java, and dabbled a little in Ruby. I invested several months of time in C# and almost a whole year on Java. I also have done Pike, Fortran, VB/ASP, Pascal, COBOL, RPG, C, C++, and, god forbid, Prograph. During my Mac days I did Symantec's Think C. I'm nearly 40 and have been working with PCs and languages since I was 14.\r\n\r\nBut PHP's deficiencies have not outweighed the deficiencies in any other language. I simply get more done in PHP and in shorter time.\r\n\r\nPike has some interesting things in it that I liked, however. And if it weren't for my work in PHP, I'd be doing Perl on Linux, more than likely.\r\n\r\nI also like C++ and C, but I'd have to use a really think abstraction framework on that so that I could focus just on the business process I want and less on the semantics of the language.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"782-1d2a6437-3e0d-486e-836e-b01d413f4a37-1566236758"}

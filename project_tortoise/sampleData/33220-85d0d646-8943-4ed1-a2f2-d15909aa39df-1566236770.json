The first part of his life, Mohammed lived in Mecca and tried to convince the Jews that he was the messiah. He was a religious teacher. Then he fled to Medina. He turned on those who rejected him. Islam became militant. They killed those who wouldn't convert. Mohammed wrote how evil the Jews are in the Koran. References from the Koran: Surah 5:82, 5:64, 9:30. In Surah 7:166, 5:60, and 2:65 Allah says that Jews were turned into monkeys and swine.\r\nThere is a lot more. See \"Islam and the Jews\" by Mark Gabriel.

Muslims kill Hindus and Christians too.","link_id":"t3_v1y6","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166323376,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33220-85d0d646-8943-4ed1-a2f2-d15909aa39df-1566236770"}

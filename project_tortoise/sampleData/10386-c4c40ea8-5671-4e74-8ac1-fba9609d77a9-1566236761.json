{"body":"No, it's NOT true that they don't attack Bush. Many episodes have attacked him and made fun of him.  Like Cartoon Wars 1 and 2, and 'Mystery of the urinal deuce'. Just to name a few. \r\n\r\nI thought you and the other morons were kidding about these guys being Republicans, but obviously you aren't. The guys who broke the record for \"sh*t\" on cable are - get this - republicans???  They, more than anyone else, are equal opportunity offenders.  Anything goes with them.  For people (like me) who detest the party-line-towing knuckle draggers on both sides, it's a remarkable refreshment.  \r\n\r\nI guess you're a card carrying liberal stooge.  Anyone who says anything bad about democrats is the enemy, right?  I'm glad there are guys like me who are actually objective about these things. Try and wrap your head around that:  Some of us don't view politics as an absolute religion. \r\n\r\nTheir point about Moore and Rumsfeld is that they are both advocate clowns who only think about their own narrow view.  Trey and Stone do the same thing to Hollywood that they do to politics.  They are consistent.  Michael Moore is a hypocrite douche. Anyone who's been awake the past five years KNOWS this.  It's not political.  \r\n\r\nI honestly wonder if your whole account here at Reddit is a work of fiction.  \r\n\r\nEDIT:  It's also worth mentioning that they created a show called 'That's My Bush!' that was hardly flattering.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tpok","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165367882,"score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"treagan","parent_id":"t1_ctrd1","id":"ctrwa","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807854,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10386-c4c40ea8-5671-4e74-8ac1-fba9609d77a9-1566236761"}

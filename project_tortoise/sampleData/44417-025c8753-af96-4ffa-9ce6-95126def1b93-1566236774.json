And gotten results which agree with the observed emission spectra of atomic hydrogen vapor? Did you have to use the Copenhagen interpretation while doing that?\r\n\r\nThe Copenhagen interpretation is a simple-minded way to explain the emergence of classical behavior from the wave-function description of a system. There are more sophisticated ways to make this transition; read Gottfried's QM textbook for a much better way: the modern idea is that finite temperature prevents one from being able to prepare a macroscopic system into a pure quantum state, basically because the energy levels are so closely spaced, and the evolution of the combined of the macroscopic apparatus and the microscopic system results in almost complete cancellation of the microscopic states that are superpositions of experimentally distinguished results.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is trivial to see quantum mechanics at work when we look at things like neon lamps or lasers producing distinct spectral lines corresponding to atomic energy levels. \r\n\r\nNext time you go to a supermarket and see the red laser at the checkout counter, realize that QM explains how that laser works, including what color it is, and you don't need to be a Danish wanna-be-philosopher to observe it.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166739997,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvot4","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvoj6","author":"sickofthisshit","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473809155,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44417-025c8753-af96-4ffa-9ce6-95126def1b93-1566236774"}

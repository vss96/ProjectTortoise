I got by on bacon, eggs, baloney, bread, peanut butter, grape jelly, canned soup, and ramen noodles.  One way I \"saved\" money was by making egg sandwiches for hungry potheads -- they'd get me high in exchange for an egg sandwich.  I recall one time I ran out of money and food and didn't eat for a week: an interesting experience I don't care to repeat.  I think I understand why mystics who fasted for weeks saw visions.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t9us","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807544,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"darkon","id":"ctbh8","parent_id":"t3_t9us","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2923-1a38485c-0a0e-4008-a435-9b06bfd80ff0-1566236759"}

If you show a client a slick looking mockup and describe to them how clicking each icon brings up another mocked up page that really looks good, then that's all they care about because that's all they wanted to buy from you.  If you show them something that looks like garbage and then tell them that the backend source is super efficient then they have every right to be disappointed in what you're delivering, because that's not what they were interested in buying from you in the first place.  \r\n\r\nThe only thing a client ever wants from a tech company is a product that helps them make money.  So a website that makes it really easy for the client's customers to buy their product is way more important than whether the website will run slightly faster or will require more resources to operate.  If a well designed website interface produces $10,000 in sales each year, but requires  $2,000 to maintain, that website is much better than a website that produces $1,000 in sales but only requires $200 to maintain each year.  The client wants you to make a product that delivers an experience to its users that makes them money, how it operates behind the scenes is irrelevant.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1167313358,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":8,"ups":8,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cw8wu","parent_id":"t3_w8ho","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"breakneckridge","retrieved_on":1473809537,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54811-5e355a3e-095b-4d96-9eea-894feb1016d8-1566236779"}

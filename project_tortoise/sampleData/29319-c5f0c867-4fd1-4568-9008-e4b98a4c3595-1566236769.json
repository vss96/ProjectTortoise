Why?  I think it was because a) we were all challenged by the material we were learning; b) classes were tiny (11-14 students each).  B) has two effects: 1) teachers can spend more time with and make sure they are challenging each and every student -   everyone learns differently, and it can be difficult to find the right way to teach each kid; 2) when there is some sort of disruption it can't snowball as easily when there's no mob.  So some of the problem *is* that schools are underfunded - keep class sizes to 14 kids max, and you'll have a better learning environment.","controversiality":0,"score":12,"ups":12,"created_utc":1166141285,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29319-c5f0c867-4fd1-4568-9008-e4b98a4c3595-1566236769"}

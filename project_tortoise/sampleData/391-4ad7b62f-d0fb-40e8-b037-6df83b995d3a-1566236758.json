{"body":"procrastitron was right. This data is very incomplete since it does not correctly ensure a fairly random sample. Simple as that.\r\n\r\nI will admit though, that noone can realistically argue against the conclusion that a larger number of men have high intelligence/ability. At the extreme ends it's *all* men.\r\n\r\nExamples: top 500 chess players, top hobbyist programmers, top math innovators.\r\n\r\nIf one to were to argue that women have the same *ability*, well that sounds more like an insult to me. Determination is the best measure of any person. eg. the quote \"genius is 90% perspiration\".\r\n\r\nSo we can talk all day about environments, female affirmative action, and how women might be so much more intelligent than men, but to me, intelligence is a tool. If you aren't going to use it better than anyone else then your better off just using it to whack yourself in the head. until you die.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t48y","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164942152,"score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"ct6jy","parent_id":"t1_ct5qo","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807452,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"391-4ad7b62f-d0fb-40e8-b037-6df83b995d3a-1566236758"}

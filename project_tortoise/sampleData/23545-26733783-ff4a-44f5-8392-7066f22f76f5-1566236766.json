{"body":"Actually, there have been some really fascinating economic studies done on prostitution.  Basically, the reason hookers cost so much is they sacrifice some of their value on the marriage \"market\".  Because they once worked as hookers, they're unlikely to capture as high-earning a mate, so they needed to be compensated for the lost income that comes with having a rich husband.  (Marriage is, after all, just institutionalized monogamous prostitution.)\r\n\r\nThis theory explains why hookers are often quite ugly underneath all the makeup and sexy outfits.  Ugly girls have less to lose, as they wouldn't score as well in the marriage market anyway, and so their comparative returns from prostitution may be more than they could reasonably expect from a husband.  Particularly if they're poor to begin with: people usually mate within social classes, so even a pretty poor girl is unlikely to snag an ugly rich husband.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uhet","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165879585,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nostrademons","id":"cui04","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuhoh","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808343,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23545-26733783-ff4a-44f5-8392-7066f22f76f5-1566236766"}

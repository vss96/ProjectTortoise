I remember when I was working on a project in .NET and wanted something, to me at least, should have been simple: an OSS standard compliant XSLT library.  Microsoft made a half-hearted attempt at supporting XSLT with an incomplete add-on.  Lucky for me the people over at Saxon ported their XSLT engine to .NET.  Hurray I thought.  But before I ran across this (I found it myself after some searching) I had posted some questions out to several .NET newsgroups asking if anyone knew of such a library.  Here's roughly the vast majority of responses I got back:\r\n\r\n&gt;\"If you don't want to use what Microsoft gave you, too bad for you you cheap mother f*\"\r\n\r\n&gt;\"You can buy an XSLT library from Company X.  Buy it now!\"\r\n\r\n&gt;\"Why are you looking for an Open Source XSLT library?  Don't be such a cheap ass and either go buy one or use the one supplied by Microsoft\"\r\n\r\nI even read some others asking about this.  One person even suggested starting a sourceforge project to build one:\r\n\r\n&gt;\"OSS is communism.\"\r\n\r\n&gt;\"You can't make money giving stuff away for free.  I don't work for free because I aint stupid\"\r\n\r\nI would like to think that these people are just a small minority of the .NET dev community, but sadly I don't think they are.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ud35","subreddit":"programming","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1165853172,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22461-7bc21443-d7f9-4943-a8eb-aed5b6230663-1566236766"}

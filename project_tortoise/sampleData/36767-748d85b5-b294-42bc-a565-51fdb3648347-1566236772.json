This might indeed be the first time Mr. Paszkiewicz has said these kind of statements in his role as a teacher OR he might have done so in the past but no one spoke up at that time. Now that Matthew LaClair has spoken up we are at least aware of the situation and have some kind of reference should it happen again. \r\n\r\nI agree there isn’t enough time in the day to speak up every time someone says something stupid. However continuing silence lends credence to what has been said. As a long time lurker and silent complainer I am only now and slowly realizing that I as an individual must occasionally speak my mind and call other people to task when they say something ‘harmfully’ stupid.\r\n\r\nFor reference, in case it hasn’t been posted elsewhere, continued local discussion of this issue can be found here:\r\nhttp://forums.kearnyontheweb.com/index.php?s=6874bc0fdee3c710afb0c7fcea6d1c32&amp;showforum=2","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166476199,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36767-748d85b5-b294-42bc-a565-51fdb3648347-1566236772"}

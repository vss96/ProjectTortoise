We'd have cliques forming, then fights, then martial law, and then secret executions. It would be total chaos. Plus, I highly believe that our bodies cannot handle living in space for so long without gravity. We might live, what, 2 years in space before badly needing real gravity or the electromagnetism of the Earth's core, among other things. And then think of the absurdity of a concept like unemployment or rampant racism in these space cities if it were to become a success -- no matter where we go, human neuroses and psychoses, if not our default nature of laziness (as a whole), follow us everywhere.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_taej","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165121314,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":-1,"score":-1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4469-b2aa0616-8cb9-4858-b179-adacb983797d-1566236759"}

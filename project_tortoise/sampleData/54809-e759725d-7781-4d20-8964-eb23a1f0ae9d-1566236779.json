No system that launched above the inflation-adjusted $300 mark has ever \"won\" the console wars. If charging small fortune helped a system's prospects, we'd all be reminiscing over the Neo-Geo.\r\n\r\nEvery successful console since the Atari 2600 era has hugged the $300 mark; the PS3 at $600 shares a price point with such luminaries as the CD-i and Sega Saturn.\r\n\r\nAt at $60-$80 a pop, that puts the price of the games in league with the N64. Sony needs to sell 10 or so before they can make up the $300 loss they're taking on the console and even start to turn a profit. (taking your assumption of \"half\" as a given; but realistically I don't think Sony gets nearly that much).\r\n\r\nSo again, would you rather be Nintendo and make a profit on every system and every game sold, or Sony that's *depending* on PS3 owners to buy *at least* 10 games before they can even start to realize a profit on the thing?","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w37e","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809537,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ejp1082","id":"cw8wr","parent_id":"t1_cw8s9","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54809-e759725d-7781-4d20-8964-eb23a1f0ae9d-1566236779"}

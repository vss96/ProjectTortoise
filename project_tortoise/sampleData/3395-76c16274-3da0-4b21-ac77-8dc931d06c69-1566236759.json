Looks like it takes about twice the time using invSqrt than to use (float)(1.0 / Math.sqrt(...)).  Here's the strange part: the profile indicates that the entire function, including the Float calls, are completely flattened by inlining.    Should be kicking fast compared to sqrt in that case.  :-(  Dunno what's going on.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_t9zb","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807568,"author":"feijai","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctcfm","edited":false,"id":"ctcrg","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3395-76c16274-3da0-4b21-ac77-8dc931d06c69-1566236759"}

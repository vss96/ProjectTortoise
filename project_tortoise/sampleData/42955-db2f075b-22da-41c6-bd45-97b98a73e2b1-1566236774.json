Beauty is a phenomenon of perception.  If there is no-one to perceive the object, it cannot be beautiful, since beauty is a subjective response.  If you're trying to say that certain objects are (for whatever reason) more likely to appear beautiful, or to appear beautiful to most people, that is a different argument.  Beauty can *never* be objective, any more than that tree falling in the deserted forest can make noise.\r\n\r\nTake the varying shapes of female beauty across cultures and centuries as an example.  If anything, one would expect physical beauty in another human being to be invariant, yet the differences are profound.\r\n\r\nYou may well be right about the ugliness of our machinery and the consequent effects on our taste.  That varies from culture to culture, certainly.  In my experience, Italians and some French still have a strong aesthetic sense, whereas Americans are relatively blind to the appalling ugliness around them.  It in the US, however, there is a cultural resistance to beauty, or taste -- it is an avowedly utilitarian society.","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42955-db2f075b-22da-41c6-bd45-97b98a73e2b1-1566236774"}

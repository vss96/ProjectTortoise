Do you have any idea how many laws there are? Diseased old men have been churning them out for centuries, and no one reads them or teaches them to people. Are you quite certain you've never broken the law? Instead of this insane, never-ending tail-chasing kafka-esque system, don' you think, maybe, it might be more effective to promote and rely on the good will of your fellow man? That's all that's really keeping the world running anyway.\r\n\r\nI find it sad that people seem incapable of even questioning the government's right to 'punish' people. As long as you continue using two different sets of standards for the moral behavior of groups and that of individuals, people will never be free. \r\n\r\nDefine \"self\" and I'll gladly take responsibility for it. I'm serious. Before shooting off about concepts like personal responsibility, you chould have a philosophical foundation and be able to define your terms. Do you believe in a \"soul\"? If not, what are \"you\" aside from your biology and your environment. Not much room there for taking 'personal responsibilty', is there? \r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, brilliant insight re: my distaste for authority, but I don't understand your reference to closets.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uf7k","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165954359,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25516-ba885e2e-51bd-48c2-9788-15ab35438ec0-1566236767"}

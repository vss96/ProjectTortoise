We PAY a LOT of money for those crappy seats and I'll kiss/read/draw/sleep/snore all I want, with whomever I want, thank you very much. Unless American explicitly states in a contract that all passengers sign before boarding rules of conduct on board the flightm then American has no authority to tell you what to do. Conduct should be one the same level as a public space, meaning you can't whip it out and do the dirty deed, but you sure as hell can kiss. Luckily I stopped flying American airlines many years ago.","controversiality":0,"score":33,"ups":33,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164968878,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t6wc","id":"ct7l8","author":"madmax_br5","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807472,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"935-633a16de-8827-4fe0-9e56-52cb142a4153-1566236758"}

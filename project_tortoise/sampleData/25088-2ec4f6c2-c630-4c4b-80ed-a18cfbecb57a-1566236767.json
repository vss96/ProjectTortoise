I always find myself thinking how much better off I'd be if the documents were HTML instead.\r\n\r\nI think it's a good idea to flag PDF links with [pdf].","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165942462,"score":7,"ups":7,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25088-2ec4f6c2-c630-4c4b-80ed-a18cfbecb57a-1566236767"}

I know it, you know it, get used to it already.\r\n\r\n2) Calling $0.002 point zero zero two cents is a common mistake among common people, get used to it already.\r\n\r\n3) You talked for almost 2 hours on the phone over a $71 bill.  (someone above says 27 minutes)\r\n\r\n4) You yourself made mutliple math mistakes while grilling people on math and the semantics of saying .002 cents.\r\n\r\n5) You explained the problem like a drunk crackhead with a learning disability.  When you talk in circles and don't clarify what you mean then common people don't understand you.  I have no idea about the first x people you spoke with but I could have shown Andrea where she was wrong in under 1 minute.  It appears as if you are doing this on purpose.\r\n\r\n6) You are a patronizing asshole when you speak.  Talking to people in the background with quotes similar to \"Oh God\" and \"I'm teaching math here\" is not going to make someone take the time to help you.\r\n\r\n7) This post will probably get on the first page of Digg.  When your blog posts are the same drivel that the guys who work 4 hours then play video games for 16 hours each day will Digg and praise you for then it's gay.\r\n\r\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = Retarded","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165574235,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":-41,"score":-41,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_u2uh","edited":false,"id":"cu3hn","author":"Simply23","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808069,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15722-89bc84de-d136-4600-a5af-aada39723ea8-1566236763"}

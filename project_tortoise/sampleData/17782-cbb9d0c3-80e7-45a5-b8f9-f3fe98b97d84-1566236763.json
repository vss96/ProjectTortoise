I was just saying that you can't do i/o the straightforward way like in most languages where you just have a simple function that does it because a pure function must return the same thing for a given set of arguments.  But yes the fact that monads provide a level of indirection between these operations can be useful and offset the added level of complexity.  Its just like the argument with pointers:  sure you have to store an extra word when you have some data in memory AND another chunk of data which holds the address of that data, which must have an address of its own, but look at all the wonderful things pointers can do (like destroy your machine).  \r\n","ups":0,"score":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165634686,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu6br","id":"cu78n","author_flair_text":null,"author":"patchwork","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808140,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17782-cbb9d0c3-80e7-45a5-b8f9-f3fe98b97d84-1566236763"}

Merely closing down troublesome accounts would be enough, but surely they would take protective measures even further to prevent the system from being exploited again. Soon there will be nothing left to be exploited.\r\n\r\n&gt; DRM stripped from the downloads, DRM which is under the control of the server side process.\r\n\r\nNope, sorry. DRM is strictly a client technology. That's why I say it can be (and will always be) beaten. It gets a little troublesome when hardware makers also cooporate with DRM makers, since you would need to meddle with the circuits to override it, but it's far from impossible.\r\n\r\n&gt; Now look at the vulnerabilities in web based bulletin boards, chat rooms, and so on. Manufacturers issuing security patch after security patch - because server side processes have been compromised.\r\n\r\nAdmitted, new vulnerabilities appear when they roll out new features, but they get close down one by one. Vulnerabilities *are* limited. On systems which are simple enough, it is not rare to have no vulnerabilities at all.\r\n\r\n&gt; There is NO such thing as 'hacker-proof' - no one system is 100% secure. Security is about managing those vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nTry hacking my home telephone, then. Or my television. Or an MP3 players. Or an MS-DOS connected to the Internet. Or a static hand-coded micro-webservers. Again, when things are simple enough, vulnerabilities simply do not exist, or are easily managable. When they get large, well, you need some manpower to keep things in control (since it gets exponentially harder to make it hacker-proof), but if they only keep on patching it, surely it will one day become hacker-proof. (DDoS excluded, of course. That's an entirely different story.)\r\n\r\n&gt; do you think MS would be capable of exposing an online OS to the world and have it be 'hack-proof' from day one?\r\n\r\nNope, somehow I'm certain that it wouldn't. But it doesn't need to be hack-proof from day one, does it? The damage can be managed. It's a part of the investment.

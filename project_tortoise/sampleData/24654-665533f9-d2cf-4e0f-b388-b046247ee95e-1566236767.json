Most times when people say \"that's greed!\", it's actually just the healthy running of the economy.  If the word can be rendered meaningless by overuse and parody, that's probably a good thing.\r\n\r\nJust like when certain christians are horrified when people have premarital sex and try to convince them they are 'living in sin' - it's actually just people having fun.  In Britain virtually everything fun is jokingly referred to as being a sin, thus diluting the christian use of the word.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ug5r","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808386,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"acrophobia","parent_id":"t1_cuj7q","id":"cuk9t","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24654-665533f9-d2cf-4e0f-b388-b046247ee95e-1566236767"}

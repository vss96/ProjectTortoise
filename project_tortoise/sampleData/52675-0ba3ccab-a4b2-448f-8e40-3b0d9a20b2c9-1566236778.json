But your original comment made it appear as if maximizing utility was defined in such a way as to only include purely selfish utility functions. ie, you said \"I do it because I'm rational.\" The phrasing suggested that you were claiming that selfish utility functions are inherently a more rational choice, while I don't see anything obviously more rational one way or the other, a priory, about ultimately selfish goals vs ultimately altruistic goals. Rationality would seem to come in only afterwards. ie, \"given such and such a utility function, and such a such a state of reality, what should I do now?\"\r\n\r\nDoes that clarify what I was saying there?\r\n\r\nAnd my vauge comment on game theory was meant to indicate something along the lines of \"I'm not sure, but I'd imagine there may be effects along the lines of them tending to update their menu based on what people will pay for, so by not paying for something you liked, you increase the chance that the thing you like won't be availible on the menu.\"","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w3n5","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809458,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Psy-Kosh","edited":false,"id":"cw4uo","parent_id":"t1_cw4r6","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52675-0ba3ccab-a4b2-448f-8e40-3b0d9a20b2c9-1566236778"}

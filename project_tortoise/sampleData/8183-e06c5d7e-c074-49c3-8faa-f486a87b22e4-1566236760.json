She PLAYS a \"cum sucking whore\" (hate that description, btw). In a PERFORMANCE. In entertainment. Perhaps not the classiest entertainment, but it is nonetheless part of show business. And BangBros is one of the best companies out there- it's not a small or \"dirty\" operation, but big business.\r\n\r\nBut you are calling her (the performer) a \"cum sucking whore\", not the character that she plays. That phrase is wholly degrading, and the only point in using it is to establish some superiority over the person you are talking about. Here, let me state your full thought for you: \"I imagine all the girls I look at in porn to be worth nothing, and that aggressive dominance is part of what gets me hot. They're just cum sucking whores to serve my sexual needs. If there is actually a person behind the body that screws up my dominance fantasy.\" \r\n\r\nWe have a whole bunch of people in the business that refuse to call women \"whores\", \"sluts\", etc... Instead, they celebrate sexuality and it' increasing openness in society. And, of course, they provide stuff to masturbate to that you won't feel bad about after. If you want to see what I am talking about, check out AWAussieGirls.com (NSFW) for example.","controversiality":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165288676,"ups":28,"score":28,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8183-e06c5d7e-c074-49c3-8faa-f486a87b22e4-1566236760"}

I think that:\r\n\r\n- Oil is going to get way more expensive in the future. Eventually it will be impractical for use as the kind of large-scale motor fuel that it's being used for today.  The SUV is probably an endangered species, unless batteries get really really good.\r\n\r\n- Oil will never (at least anytime soon) go away completely as a fuel.  It will still be used in aviation, for large machinery, etc.  It's just going to get replaced by (IMHO) electricity for small vechicles.\r\n\r\n- At the same time, we are not \"running out\" of oil.  The sky will not fall, although there may be some pain in the pocketbook.\r\n\r\n- Peak oil could be fantastic from a political point of view.  A lot of the evil in the world today is linked to the petroleum cartels.\r\n\r\n- One last thing: the oil companies *want* you to think that oil is *absolutely indepensible* to modern life.  The reality is that *some* oil is required for modern life but the bulk of it that we use is replaceable by other resources.  The amount of oil required to sustain modernity (for plastics, aviation, etc.) is probably less than 1/3 the amount that we currently use.  That amount can be supplied by known reserves of more expensive oil in places like Canada, Venezuela, Colorado, Russia, northern Europe, the Gulf of Mexico, etc.  The petro-cartels are *terrified* of oil price spikes because they are *terrified* that these will stimulate alternative energy investment.  They want us to stay addicted.\r\n\r\nThere are many totally underutilizied energy sources for electricity: nuclear, tidal, waves, wind, small hydro, biomass, solar, etc.  There is huge potential for electricity development in the world.  We are not running out of energy, and batteries are getting good enough to make electric cars practical.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.teslamotors.com/\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165522445,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctzrm","id":"cu0yh","author":"api","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808022,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14458-c07aa57a-3ca1-4ad0-abdf-7a09eb7b313b-1566236762"}

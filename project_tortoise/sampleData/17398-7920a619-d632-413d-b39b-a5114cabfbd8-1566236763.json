{"controversiality":0,"body":"I was driving one time and came upon a tow truck (no flashing lights on, and no car being towed) going significantly lower than the speed limit. I passed him safely. He sped up and started tailgating me. I slowed down until he passed, and then matched his speed and turned on my brights. I figured, he's an asshole for tailgating and I'll show him. Then out of nowhere he shows me what _real_ brights are, turning on all the rear-facing lights in the truck, and stomps his brakes. I was following at a safe distance, so I managed to stop in time, but my heart was going a million miles an hour.\r\n\r\nNowadays I'm less inclined toward passive aggressive behaviour when someone else isn't driving courteously. Two wrongs really don't make a right, and sooner or later you'll come across someone who's willing to add a third, and decisive, wrong to the list.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u62g","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":18,"score":18,"created_utc":1165622797,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"crwper","parent_id":"t3_u62g","edited":false,"id":"cu6oa","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808130,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17398-7920a619-d632-413d-b39b-a5114cabfbd8-1566236763"}

Fast food isn't targeted to you or me as regular meals. But there are tens of millions that eat it everyday because it is cheap, tastes good, and takes only 8 mins so they can get back to work and earn a few dollars more. Most don't have calculators or financial wisdom to work out the true long-term cost of unhealthy foods.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard for people who are not in the cycle of gloomy day-labor/chores to realize how someone can slowly make Burger King their daily lunch habitat. You have to step back from reddit.com's frugal eating tips and realize not everyone is smart, educated, intelligent to realize any of this.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of economics is that people do things without knowing anything about them. In this case, preference for unhealthier food over healthier ones based on cost, taste, and readiness. You can spend the rest of your life educating them on cooking tips, bad carbs, and good cholesterol but it's not going to work. They tried it with drugs, alcohol, and teenage sex. People have demands and they will do their best to fulfill them with the monetary resources they have.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to offer a different social and economic structure instead of placing the burden and blame on individuals that already are in quite an unfortunate place in society. Offer them a Turkish Chicken Goat Salad for $2 in front of the same McDonalds and they will try it out as long as the salad is filling and tastes decent, even if it's not as great as the juicy burgers. Give coupons etc. to lower prices further to keep them coming.\r\n\r\nInstead what we have currently are healthy-freak fast food joints that sell me lettuce for 10x the grocery store price.  It costs me a lot more to make two rice/bean/cheese burritos  than the $1/burrito I pay at Taco Bell regardless of the quality of ingredients they or I use.\r\n\r\nLet me take your example. $7 salad - $1 ingredients = $6 markup for preparation, labor, overhead, and profit. Why can't some company come in and say, \"Hey! Let's see if it's possible to lower the $6 to $1 by employing techniques X, Y, Z. And let's bargain for the best price on ingredients so that it only costs us 30c/salad instead of $1.\" I know the joke is overused but they can indeed make up the profits in volume.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, currently, nobody cares about making better, cheaper options available. But then nobody's demanding for it either. If there's a demand for it, there will be supply. That's how it works.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807827,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctqgv","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctpyn","author_flair_text":null,"author":"chime","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9617-257947a6-c7f4-418e-bf21-76d8bd5f51dd-1566236761"}

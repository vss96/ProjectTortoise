Battleships were no longer the primary attack weapon, carriers were. This would be demonstrated at Midway 6 months later.\r\n\r\nHad the Japanese succeeded in sidelining the carriers, there would have a period of several months where the US ability to challenge the Japanese would have been severly compromised, and the US would have either had to negotiate, or by the time they could have stood up to the Japanese, they might have established forward bases at places like Midway that would have made it far more difficult to dislodge them.","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165298660,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_tl02","edited":false,"id":"ctnof","author":"mralex","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807775,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8409-b7c5d230-bebb-4883-b74b-f2e0e5127f37-1566236760"}

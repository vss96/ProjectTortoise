Merely expressing any opinion on the subject of the nation of Israel has become a troll on Reddit.com.\r\n\r\nIt's not a troll because everyone posting about it is wrong, stupid, or just trying to inflame the readership.  It's a troll because we can no longer distinguish knowledgeable, insightful, and calm opinions on the emotional topic of Israel from comments and submissions worded solely to draw the anger of one side or other.\r\n\r\nThe sensible solution is to establish some basic standards of civility and scholarship about Israel and future hot topics.  We should agree to all speak respectfully to one another, to keep invective in our statements to a minimum (\"Israel Kills 6 in Gaza Strip\" as opposed to \"Israeli Apartheid Slaughters 6 Innocent Muslims in Illegally-Held Gaza Strip\"), and (most importantly) to *cite our sources and oblige when asked to cite sources for asserted facts*.\r\n\r\nI think if we start now, with this topic, we can have standards of healthy discussion firmly in place by the time Reddit grows enough to acquire real trolls posting about even-more-ire-raising topics.  Let's keep Reddit the civil, logical and ultimately superior site as which it began life.","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473808052,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu2l5","parent_id":"t3_u2k3","author":"EliGottlieb","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15294-ea91721d-2d88-4e34-918e-ad3d7cb4bfe6-1566236762"}

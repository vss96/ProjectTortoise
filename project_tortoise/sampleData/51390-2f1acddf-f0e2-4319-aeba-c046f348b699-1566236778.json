Now I'm back to Perl since about 3 years, and love it. Despite the usual FUD about read-onlyness (you should know what you do when writing large web applications, and if you don't, you're going to produce a mess in _any_ language), it's maintainable and provides already invented wheel solutions even for the most up-to-date problems on [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/).\r\n\r\nPerl provides many web frameworks in different styles and flavours, I'm personally very happy with [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/) ([CPAN Link](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst-Runtime/)), combined with [DBIx-Class](http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class/) as the ORM and [Template-Toolkit](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Toolkit/) as templating solution. It has a _very_ active community, and many of it's users/contributors/devs are developing high-quality applications with it.","score":9,"ups":9,"created_utc":1167154432,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cw2l3","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w0ju","author":"phaylon","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809416,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51390-2f1acddf-f0e2-4319-aeba-c046f348b699-1566236778"}

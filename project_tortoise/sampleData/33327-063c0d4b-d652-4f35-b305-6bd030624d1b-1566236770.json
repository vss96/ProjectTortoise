Since Haskell lazily evaluates everything, the only thing that gets created is a thunk that can compute a stream of values.  Moreover, good strictness analysis &amp; deforestation will eliminate even that.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Haskell prelude function generates exactly the same code as C would.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808735,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cv2vq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv2nm","author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33327-063c0d4b-d652-4f35-b305-6bd030624d1b-1566236770"}

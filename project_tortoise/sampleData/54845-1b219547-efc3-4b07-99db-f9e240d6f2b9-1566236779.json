This sends light signal for a loop - a buffer, thusly delaying it if compared with a straight-through signal.\r\n\r\nLike for example, negative refraction materials, where refractive index n = speed of light in material / speed of light in vacuum. Here, the speed of light in material is faster than that in vacuum.

Kurt Gödel thought that your idea had no merit.\r\n\r\nGödel's work showed that any system must necessarily be incomplete, not that everything modelled in the system must be tangible.\r\n\r\n&gt; When you have the sum 1 + 1 = 2 you are most certainly counting actual things. You are applying a set of very specific rules to determine if the physical marks you made on your paper (or computer in this case or even the neurons that are holding the information in your head) follow what we know about how we put objects together and how we group sets of objects.\r\n\r\nBut those marks are *representations* of the ideas, the ideas themselves don't exist.  The fact that, as you admit yourself, the same thing can be represented in different media simultaneously should tip you off about that - if I have a formula, which is the \"real\" formula that you claim exists - the neurons in my head, the textbook I'm reading it from, or the paper I'm writing it on?  None of them - they are all *representations* of an abstract concept.  The concept itself has no existence.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vo8v","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166807289,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45675-d3715632-5535-4f84-a9fd-0726596677d3-1566236775"}

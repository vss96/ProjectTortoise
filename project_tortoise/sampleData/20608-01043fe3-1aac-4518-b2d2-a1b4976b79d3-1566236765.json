You can write your document with one tool and count words with another tool. If you don't need to count words you don't have to know about the word counting program (and you simply don't install it). This is essentially the Unix philosophy. Every user uses a larger percentage of the features of each tool he/she has installed.\r\n\r\nFor a powerful system you need three things (SICP):\r\n\r\n- primitive operations (wc)\r\n- ways to primitive basic operations (pipes)\r\n- ways to name these combination so you can treat them as primitive (files -- shell scripts)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this isn't easy for \"normal\" users.\r\n\r\nThe Windows philosophy is: give the user many complex basic operations and hope that is enough. This works better than the current Unix tools for non technical users.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to create a Unix philosophy system for the masses?","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165780604,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"cucn8","parent_id":"t1_cuc0o","author":"julesjacobs","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808241,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20608-01043fe3-1aac-4518-b2d2-a1b4976b79d3-1566236765"}

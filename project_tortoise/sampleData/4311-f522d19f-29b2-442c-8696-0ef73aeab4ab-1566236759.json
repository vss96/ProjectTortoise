However if there wasn't something to stop the sun from heating up one side I think it would form a feedback loop and go faster and faster. It isn't perpetual motion because the sun would be supplying the new energy. I'm sure that in any hypothetical space torus there is always some kind of thermal shielding to keep the temperatures within a certain range.\r\n  I bet you could take a closed tube of some liquid and heat it up on one side to see if a flow starts. After it gets too hot I bet turbulence sets in.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807605,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctdio","id":"cten2","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jstco","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4311-f522d19f-29b2-442c-8696-0ef73aeab4ab-1566236759"}

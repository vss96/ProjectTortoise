Our state constitution provides that Washington State's northern boundary in the relevant area is 'west along said forty-ninth parallel of north latitude.'  Const. art. XXIV, sec. 1.  At the time the United States-Canada border was originally surveyed, prior to Washington's admission into the Union as a state, the surveyors used an astronomic method of locating the 49th parallel that failed to account for local gravitational pulls.  For this and other reasons, the international border does not lie on the 49th parallel as currently located.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165488264,"ups":3,"score":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13528-de62b9a2-e470-4f2f-a22f-79e4af60337f-1566236762"}

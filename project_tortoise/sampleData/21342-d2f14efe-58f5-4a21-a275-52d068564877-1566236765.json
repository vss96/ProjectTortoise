The language is rather limited if you're used to Common Lisp (only has machine-size integers, no rationals), dynamic scoping is the only way of passing values from one function to another, which is unacceptable. The language implementation has amateurish restrictions (only 1 million cons cells can be allocated; string literals cannot exceed a certain length; the interactive terminal interpreter cannot parse multi-line expressions). Finally it is an interpreted language and thus is very slow.\r\n\r\nAlso the author has a very arrogant attitude where he tries to portray newLisp as a \"practical\" implementation of Lisp, unlike what he thinks is archaic Common Lisp, when in fact newLisp is far less useful for real programming than almost any Common Lisp implementation.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ubfs","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808265,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_cudsg","id":"cudw7","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21342-d2f14efe-58f5-4a21-a275-52d068564877-1566236765"}

Small towns or large, people hear about someone accused of a crime, sin, or just a belief, get angry about it, and things happen to the accusee regardless of his guilt or innocence.  People spit in his face, pick fights with him in the street, or even just send him nasty letters.\r\n\r\nThis shit happens among everyone regardless of demographic too.\r\n\r\nGet over it.

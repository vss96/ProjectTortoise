This is more a sign of those times; we've been dealing with the war on drugs since Nixon's era, and only in the past 15 years or so has this epidemic of no-knock searches on otherwise peaceful residences begun. Personally, if I were to attack one problem before another, I'd take the SWAT raids for an ounce of hash.

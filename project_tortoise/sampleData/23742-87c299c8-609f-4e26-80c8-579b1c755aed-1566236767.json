{"controversiality":0,"body":"The redefinition of communism causes the meaning of a large body of literature to have a meaning completely different from the intended one to a lot of people. By using the modern version of communism you are propagating a meaning of the word redefined for purposes of propaganda.\r\n\r\nGiven that the shift in meaning ocurred fairly recently I think it is more correct to use the meaning that it has in most of the literature using it. The same for anarchism, capitalism, etc. Demonizing certain political philosophies by associating them with things they are not reduces our ability as a society to have rational discussions about these things.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ug5r","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":13,"ups":13,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165885234,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"unknown_lamer","id":"cuic3","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuhux","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808349,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23742-87c299c8-609f-4e26-80c8-579b1c755aed-1566236767"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"After reading this essay, I came to the comments section expecting a flood of positive response &amp; engaging discussion. I'm truly disappointed in all of the nit-picking &amp; harsh criticism.\r\n\r\nAs an artist myself, the whole \"taste is subjective\" assertion never sat right with me. Apparently it is a really easy trap to fall into, &amp; I find it shamelessly used as an excuse for laziness all over the artworld. \r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this essay. Thanks for writing it.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ufsk","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166631951,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"sitablue","edited":false,"id":"cvi5l","parent_id":"t3_ufsk","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809026,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41046-00b5c83a-4351-44db-b171-2b89083fbca4-1566236773"}

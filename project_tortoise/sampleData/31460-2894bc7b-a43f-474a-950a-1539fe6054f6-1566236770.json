Another fun one was when escalating a call to a manager (if it met escalation criteria,) I would listen in and the customer's tone would change immediately to peaches and cream and often they'd complain about how I treated them poorly (rarely the case, especially if they made it to an escalation manager through me.) Often times the escalation manager would be listening in on the call before I transfered it to them and they'd know the customer was full of it and if not they'd come ask me about it after the call.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uyp7","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166218629,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31460-2894bc7b-a43f-474a-950a-1539fe6054f6-1566236770"}

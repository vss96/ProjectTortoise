{"controversiality":0,"body":"So you don't think there's something a bit gross about buying from warez-sellers? To me it looks a bit like hiring hackers to change a college score. It's only a matter of time before someofmp3 are taken down and I'm sure a lot of the cheerleaders will be screaming for blood when their balances disappear overnight. The best you can pray for is that they actually start paying artists (instead of lying about it) which would make their prices normalise to itunes-type levels - though I can't see that happening as they would never be able to cover the back payments. I see the first thing on their front page now is a big promotion to get people to refill their accounts...hmm\r\n\r\nAs for their selection, it's not 'all of mp3' by any stretch - I just did a casual search and there's a lot of stuff I'm aware of they don't have that you can find on slsk or even itunes.","link_id":"t3_w7j7","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167354628,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"chu","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cwaxo","id":"cwb8c","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809581,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55980-10818a38-580c-4dbf-bbcb-c2a3abfbb5b4-1566236779"}

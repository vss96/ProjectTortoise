If most people started preparing a couple of years ago by paying down debt and not getting into more debt, that would have probably prevented it.  As it is, the credit cards are maxed out, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th mortgages have already been taken out against the meager amount of home equity so that there's no equity left (and the number is negative for some folks).  I just talked to someone today who took out an interest-only ARM loan about a year and a half ago and he expressed surprise at how fast his monthly payment has been rising - I suspect that if it weren't for parental loans they'd be subsisting on ramen by now.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21595-84be5438-a12c-4f19-bc32-b965456d789d-1566236765"}

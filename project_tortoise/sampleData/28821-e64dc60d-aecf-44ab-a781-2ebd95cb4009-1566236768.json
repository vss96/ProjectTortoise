That's just stupid.\r\n\r\nOf course lack of diversity in the space program shows inequality. Not because of what idiots like Medved assumes, but because americans simply don't have the same opportunity from birth to grave.\r\n\r\nIt's about inequality in education, poverty and the imbalance in the very social fabric of america.

Search is a feature.  More generally \"easy access to relevant data\" is a feature and \"search\" is ONE way of supporting that feature.\r\n\r\nThe five products will be more like Microsoft's Office suite.  I don't mean that they will be equivalents of Outlook, Word, Excel etc... that's a bit of a naive and outdated concept.  They will be five tools for jobs that users see as conceptually different.  \r\n\r\nThis perceived conceptual difference will provide context for Google to know what the \"relevant data\" is.  Google's technological expertise will make it easy to access that relevant data.\r\n\r\nGoogle will want to support features horizontally across the five products that appear as intrinsic operations (the same way cut &amp; paste in Office are now).  \r\n\r\nThe challenges will be:  \r\n\r\n* To avoid overloading these products with bells and whistles which baffle users.  \r\n* To keep quick development processes.  \r\n* To keep smart people interested in working on these features.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165314804,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"ctobx","parent_id":"t3_tkmz","author_flair_text":null,"author":"banjaxed","retrieved_on":1473807787,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8656-532daded-fb09-4c6a-a470-9fbcf9d24b51-1566236760"}

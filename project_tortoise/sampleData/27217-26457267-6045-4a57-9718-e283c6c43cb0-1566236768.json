I'm not a big fan of that either.  Part of the reason we have a screwed up government right now is that the rich were getting upset at paying so much higher percentage of income so they started putting money into the political system to “correct” the problem.  So now we have an idiot as president for basically the sole purpose of lowering the taxes on the rich. \r\n\r\nI think everyone should pay taxes, EVERYONE, poor people and rich people.  The idea that part of the population pays no federal income taxes is idiotic.  People only value what they pay for, as soon as they stop paying they stop caring.  If poor people had to pay taxes we would have national health care because they would start demanding something from the government.  Our education system might also see a boost.  The government is owned by the people that pay for it.\r\n\r\nThe reason we have ultra rich people now is because economies of scale are so large.  Take Google, Redit, commodity markets, finance markets, one person can make a huge impact on a lot of people.  \r\n","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473808488,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cupsa","parent_id":"t3_unoz","edited":false,"author":"Fountainhead","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27217-26457267-6045-4a57-9718-e283c6c43cb0-1566236768"}

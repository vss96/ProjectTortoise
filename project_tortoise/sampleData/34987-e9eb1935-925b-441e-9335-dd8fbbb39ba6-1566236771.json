Zhukov was the Russian commander who encircled the German 8th Army at Stalingrad, forcing its surrender.  The northern flank of 8th Army's supply line was defended by Romanian allies who quickly folded.  \r\n\r\nThe Wehrmacht consisted of the Heer (army), the Luftwaffe (airforce), and the Kriegsmarine (navy).  Service in these branches was limited to Germans and immediate allies (e.g. Austrians, who by the time of WWII were technically Germans after the Anschluss in 1938).  Ukranians and other non-Germans were restricted to serving in the Waffen-SS,  the fighting branch of the SS, which had it's own military heirarchy and command structure seperate from the Wehrmacht.  If I remember correctly, somewhere around 50% or so of the Waffen-SS was ethnically non-German by the end of the war, although I am too lazy to look it up on Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nUkranians did indeed welcome the Germans as liberators early in the war, as Ukraine had suffered greatly under Stalin's collectivization program during the 1930s (a time of serious state-imposed starvation which claimed millions of Ukranians).","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166410252,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cv623","parent_id":"t1_cv2mb","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"crake","retrieved_on":1473808794,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34987-e9eb1935-925b-441e-9335-dd8fbbb39ba6-1566236771"}

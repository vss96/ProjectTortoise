{"link_id":"t3_t92a","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"Let's do a quick comparison. Single-payer health care:\r\n\r\n1. Provides coverage for everyone instead of only 80 percent of people;\r\n2. Doesn't ration health care based on sick people's ability to pay;\r\n3. Costs just over half as much overall as for-profit health care;\r\n4. Costs taxpayers the same as for-profit health care (i.e. doesn't require tax increases);\r\n5. Actually benefits the wealthy by treating everyone who needs it and hence reducing the incidence of infectious disease outbreaks; and\r\n6. Improves overall productivity by reducing delays due to illness.\r\n\r\nThe only defects that I can see are:\r\n\r\n1. Health care is rationed based on triage - i.e. medical necessity - so rich people don't get to buy their way to the front of the line; and\r\n2. Free market ideologues may have to rethink their assumption that the market always does everything better, for ever and ever, amen.\r\n\r\nHmmm. Tough decision.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165087022,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctd44","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctakn","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","retrieved_on":1473807575,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3555-6b48ee19-ea5e-46bf-b8c7-c969925b2003-1566236759"}

You *might as well* get the benefit of the compiler checking everything for you as grauenwolf mentioned.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Lisp, Python or some other dynamically typed language where you can say something like:\r\n\r\narea = Area(50)\r\n\r\nthen I can see how you might not want to use typing in this way and simply say:\r\n\r\narea = 50\r\n\r\nJust my opinion.  I program my own stuff (at home) in Python and sometimes Common Lisp, but at work I have to use Java, so I end up using Java to its fullest since it makes me write tons of code to do relatively small tasks.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165545646,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15155-70b1a909-fa91-4bf9-acb0-f6340cff5dc5-1566236762"}

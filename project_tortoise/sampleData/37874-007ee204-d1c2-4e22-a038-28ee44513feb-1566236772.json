So if you did not understand - second time:\r\n&gt;This is not a Rosa Parkes case, where she is forced to the back of the bus by the law of the country. The men who beat her up are violent criminals in the eyes of Israeli law.\r\n\r\nMoreover I will tell you the most sacred secret of Israel state, nobody (except some jews) knows that secret:\r\nThey have crimes in Israel - thefts, killing, rapes.

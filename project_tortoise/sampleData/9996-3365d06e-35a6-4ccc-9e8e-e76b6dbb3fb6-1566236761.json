{"controversiality":0,"body":"It doesn't really sound like you will save much time with that card.\r\n\r\nSeveral European airports already have a \"Fast Track\" lane with its own security and sometimes passport control (seen in Heathrow London and Copenhagen). Typically Business class tickets are required (in case of SAS in Copenhagen you can get through with a Eurobonus Gold frequent flier card, or a Economy Flex ticket).\r\n\r\nIMO Airport selection makes more of a difference when flying out of London: the worst is flying out of Stansted with Ryanair at 0645 (having to get up at 4 in the morning to find a cab, get to the train station and get the train there). That's a nightmare, even though you can get a 0.99 ticket from Rynair (excl airport taxes, checked baggage fee, seat belt fee etc.). \r\n\r\nThe best is flying out of London City which is conveniently 20 minutes from me by public transportation and where you can check-in just 20 minutes before the flight departs.\r\n","link_id":"t3_tq26","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165356244,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"qiwi","edited":false,"id":"ctr5w","parent_id":"t3_tq26","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807839,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9996-3365d06e-35a6-4ccc-9e8e-e76b6dbb3fb6-1566236761"}

I have met numerous people who readily admitting hitting cyclists - not one single one admitted to any remorse - to a one they all blamed the cyclist, even when their own description implied fault on the part of the driver. \r\n\r\nYou can spend more time in jail for smoking weed than you can for murdering someone. When you get behind the wheel, you are steering a weapon of mass destruction and if you don't scrupulously obey the law, you are to blame if someone is hurt by you. Lose the license, go to jail - the driver must be punished.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t8ou","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807537,"author":"CAcyclist","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctb1z","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t8ou","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2684-c5d58caa-589e-40ee-ab09-ce7e1fb5e5f4-1566236759"}

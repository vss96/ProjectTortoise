As far as age, I'm 27.\r\n\r\nI've lived in Lebanon for about 7 years and visited very recently (November). You mention Africa, it also happens that I lived there for a few years (Ghana). As far as other countries, just short visits (&lt; 3 months), not enough to make any studied political observations.\r\n\r\nThis is a very well known problem in Lebanon, where people claim their religion before their country. Where Leaders are blindly trusted mostly because of their religious beliefs.\r\n\r\nThere was much effort put into this clip by a group of Lebanese citizens, which shows that this is not solely my observation, but a good majority's, who are lucky enough to observe the situation from abroad (There are more Lebanese citizens outside of Lebanon then there's in it). The positive effect of this is being able to see the big picture, the negative is the detachment that comes with it.\r\n\r\nThe clip is really referring to the weird constitution of Lebanon, where different leaders must be of different religions. President: Marounite Christian, Prime minister: Sunni Muslim, Speaker: etc... As if this is not enough, the most powerful represents the minority and the scale follows that same pattern all the way to the bottom.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should've explained all this with the clip, but I assumed most who would be interested in such a clip would have an idea or two about the situation over there. Well, you know what they say about assumption.\r\n\r\n-Nash","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166500504,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37482-bd872321-6377-4991-8347-980769f56d35-1566236772"}

It amazes me that outrages like this take place on a regular basis and there isn't enough money or impetus to get these assholes brought to book. We have a nation where a large group of people calling in to a talkshow think that Muslims should tattooed with crescents, people are getting tasered for not having ID, unarmed people are getting shot in their cars, huge groups of people are having their rights violated... these people (the \"leaders\") are testing their boundaries - seeing how far they can go. It seems they can go just as far as they want. Good luck America. God save the rest of the world.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tha5","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165208988,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6002-09c411d2-6783-4494-a0c1-a47b952fad25-1566236760"}

Please tell me if this summary is correct: The rules of the organization should forbid torture, but the individual agents should be cognizant enough to know they always have the ability to break the rules, and may occassionally do so for the greater good.\r\n\r\nBUT, I've got to add one point before I can conscionably agree: **the individuals must accept that the organization *will* (not *may*) inflict the maximum penalty for this action against them**. If the torturer is pardoned, the precedent is too awful. But if the torturers so convinced that torture will save the world that they're willing to damn themselves for the greater good, then so be it. That *has* to be the stakes. I usually abhor zero-tolerance policies, but (as we agree) we're talking about extremes and hypotheticals here.","retrieved_on":1473808924,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvcy2","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvar2","author_flair_text":null,"author":"mrstickman","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38319-102b33f4-697d-4b16-86c5-44d11a0f879e-1566236772"}

Because it is. Perhaps we atheists secretly hope there are a lot of people out there who know the emperor has no clothes but are too afraid or isolated to feel comfortable saying it. I'm sure in some parts of the country, with the wrong boss, openly admitting that you don't believe in God could get you fired. We need more public displays of Atheism.

{"body":"&gt;My point was that strong growth is a driver for a stronger currency. So not only is this a smaller issue because of the stronger growth in the US, but it will stabilize.\r\n\r\nAnd my point is that the US hasn't been gowing strongly. In Euro terms, it shrank. In USD terms, it grew at far slower pace than the everywhere that isn't using a dollar pegged currency.\r\n\r\n&gt;If you have an asset you purchased with dollars, if it goes up in value, it doesn't much matter what the relative prices of dollars are.\r\n\r\nIt does, because we are comparing it with European investments which would be made in Euros or Pounds (or various Kroner). If you had invested in European investments, you would have implicitly made 10% extra on the investment.\r\n\r\n&gt;It only matters when you want to move that money.\r\n\r\nRight. But we're implying this is happening when we make our comparison. Otherwise the price change is uninteresting as well.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wa0e","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167447225,"author":"fnord123","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cwd7v","edited":false,"id":"cwf79","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809655,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58039-e3bd87f6-525c-4ece-81d2-1160fbada6e1-1566236780"}

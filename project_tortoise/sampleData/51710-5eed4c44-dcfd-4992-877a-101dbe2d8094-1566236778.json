A large number of people walking around on the street could get through college *somewhere* with a teaching degree. So even if we raised the minimum pay to $250,000.00/year, we'd still have a lot of mediocre talent teaching in public schools in addition to the high quality talent that would be attracted by higher salaries.\r\n\r\nIf we raised the pay for teaching, we'd need to also raise the barriers to entry to teach. \r\n\r\nThe counter argument to my post is that universities usually require a Ph.D. to teach. But book smarts (which Ph.D.'s have in spades) are separate from wisdom and common sense (the application of knowledge). So we still have a bunch of bozos who are totally detached from reality teaching at the university level. I found a lot of them in the social sciences and humanities departments.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w17r","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167168138,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":4,"score":4,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51710-5eed4c44-dcfd-4992-877a-101dbe2d8094-1566236778"}

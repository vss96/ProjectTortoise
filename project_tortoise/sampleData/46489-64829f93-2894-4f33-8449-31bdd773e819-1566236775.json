The US has some funny laws that put people in jail just for DRAWING kiddie porn from their imagination.  I don't think Europe does that, though I may be wrong.\r\n\r\nIslamists may be more free in Europe.  Some of these guys in Londonistan would probably be in Guantanamo with jumper cables on their nuts if they said in the US what they say over there.\r\n\r\nIn addition to DeCSS, IP laws in general are less strictly enforced elsewhere.  Chinese music pirates probably read about RIAA lawsuits and pity our subjugation.\r\n\r\nThat's about all I can think of that you can say or express more freely in countries other than the US.  There are other things foreigners can do more freely, like drive drunk (a Mexican once complained to me that we have no libertades in the US because of drunk driving laws) or smoke at work.  But that's not speech.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vqjl","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809231,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lysine23","id":"cvstn","parent_id":"t1_cvsnb","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46489-64829f93-2894-4f33-8449-31bdd773e819-1566236775"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; Actually, you can escape your desires. First, you can die.\r\n\r\nTrue.\r\n\r\n&gt; Some struggle with the desire to drink on a daily basis and rely on a sponsor and the support mechanism provided by AA. Others have used other methods to stay dry and I know one alcoholic who after years of complete sobriety learned to drink in moderation.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to say that desires cannot change, but that we are not free to arbitrarily choose how they change. An alcoholic can quit being an alcoholic for many reasons but most if not all of them involve some desire on the part of the alcoholic to change (the others would involve some form of cohersion). The change may even result in the elimination of the desire for alcohol, but the alcoholic does not choose to have the desire to change (or I suppose he might, but then how did he have the desire to change his desire?). We are our desires and our desires are caused. Thus in a sense we have no free will (I view the term as incoherent), but we do have the freedom to choose our actions and subordinate some desires to others or I suppose as you pointed out earlier to eliminate them entirely through suicide.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vf8l","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166644301,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"djwhitt","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cviyf","id":"cvjal","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809048,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41606-1e3a0afe-3d72-4b36-9c29-ef2279476353-1566236773"}

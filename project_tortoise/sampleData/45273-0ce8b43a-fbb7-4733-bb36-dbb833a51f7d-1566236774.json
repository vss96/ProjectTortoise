Period.\r\n\r\nIf it's not her fault, why did she have to lie to the police?  She should have been able to say \"I didn't like the guy following me so closely, so instead of leaving the law to the law enforcement, I decided to become a vigilante and slam on the brakes to teach him a lesson.  Take him away please.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI typically have fantasies about doing what she claims to have done to people who tailgate, who *are* dangerous.  But they're just that, fantasies.  It's not my role to inflict what could be a fatal punishment on the person.  At best, she only committed fraud and perjury.  At worst, she tried to kill him for something that does not even have a death penalty legally attached...  People are ignoring that what they guy did was wrong *because* they so dislike what she did.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809191,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvqn1","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvn1b","author":"travisxt97","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45273-0ce8b43a-fbb7-4733-bb36-dbb833a51f7d-1566236774"}

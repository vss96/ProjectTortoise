In a world where speed, stress and pressure are the norm what makes for a luxury-filled experience is the chance to enjoy certain aspects of life which can be termed to be truly special.\r\n\r\nIt really does not matter whether you’re going on holiday for a week or looking to buy a present. If luxury is what you are looking for then you need to be able to find that something ‘special’ which defines the spirit at the heart of your lifestyle.\r\n\r\nIt could be a retreat on an island away from the public gaze or it could be a rare gift that’s not easy to find. Luxury, as a matter of fact, these days is defined as being able to access the rare, the special, the unusual and enjoy it without feeling like you’re in a supermarket queue and this includes the use of the web.\r\n\r\nEliteofeurope.com, as the name suggests, is all about luxury and it’s focused on Europe. The idea is profoundly simple. The site looks to become the one-stop shop for information on the continent pertaining to the luxury lifestyle. \r\n\r\n“A simple idea, perhaps, but so difficult to execute correctly,” says site founder David Stone, “luxury means many things to many people but at its very core it’s almost like a commonly shared dream – a sense of luxury is accompanied always with a sense of something that is truly special, amazing and personalised.” \r\n\r\nIn this sense Eliteofeurope.com has put in place an editorial team that focus on providing just that kind of content. “We want the site to open up horizons,” explains David Stone, “we will give you aspects of the luxury lifestyle you may want and not have thought about yet.” \r\n\r\nIn case you think you have to be a millionaire this is decidedly not the case. “Sure luxury costs,” explains David, “but it’s more a case of being discerning where you spend your money rather than spending it like it is going out of fashion. What we give you are ideas, suggestions and the information you need to enjoy experiences, places and items which have a unique value.”\r\n\r\nWith an increasing number of people putting a premium on their time and ability to escape the ordinary and mundane Eliteofeurope look set to help them achieve both in one fell swoop.  \r\n\r\n","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166616713,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vhbc","id":"cvhbe","edited":false,"author":"davidamerland","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809010,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40640-6190735a-e534-45ac-9f55-df5c4fa384ff-1566236773"}

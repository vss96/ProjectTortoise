Company X knows you are not going to go out and buy it just to write a short article, so the company decides to send one to you.\r\n\r\nAfter you use it for a while and write your review, what happens to the player? Company X doesn't want it, it has been used so they cannot resell it. They cannot give it to someone else to review, that person will feel insulted. The only option is to let you keep it, or pay the return shipping and then throw it away.\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809571,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cwam5","edited":false,"id":"cwaor","author_flair_text":null,"author":"grauenwolf","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55672-85ea712b-c7cd-43bb-9c02-a9ca0759636a-1566236779"}

On my notebook (with 1024x480 screen resolution), I set tabs to show up as 2 spaces. On my PC (dual 1280x1024), they appear as 4. How do you do that with space?\r\n\r\nTo me, having fixed tab width is as bad as having the font face for viewing your code preset by the previous coder. You never know when one will use Comic Sans. And yes, there are 8-space tabbers out there.\r\n\r\nAdmitted, a lot of reasons listed are outdate, but there are valid, strong ones as well. I used to be in the space-indent camp before, and it convinced me to convert. I'm glad I did.\r\n\r\n&gt; The reverse is true: more platforms support spaces than support tabs.\r\n\r\nHaven't heard of a platform that does not support tabs. If yours doesn't, get out of the 90's and use one that does.\r\n\r\nedit: formatting","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uhgd","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166067302,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27376-57b64262-31fa-4fbd-a37b-f6ccd6826b14-1566236768"}

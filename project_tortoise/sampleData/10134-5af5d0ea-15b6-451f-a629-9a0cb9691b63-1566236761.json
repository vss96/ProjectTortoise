The former is unscientific and the latter is semantic bullshit. If the Bible were the divinely inspired word of god, it's message would be scientifically sound and unambiguous. When you introduce priests into the picture, you start playing word games.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tq6l","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165360206,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10134-5af5d0ea-15b6-451f-a629-9a0cb9691b63-1566236761"}

You've disputed the basis of an entire well-established branch of cognitive psychology, based upon nothing but your own personal incredulity, and then you act surprised when I ask you to supply some evidence. \r\n\r\nReally, you're starting to sound like a creationist or a flat-earther. Chanting \"You don't know that for sure!\" repeatedly is not a argument. We don't know anything for sure. Theories can never be proven, only disproven. \r\n\r\nIf you wish to dispute a model with demonstrated predictive power, point out a discrepancy between its predictions and experimental results or other reliable observations of reality. \r\n\r\nOr, better yet, go educate yourself about artificial neural nets.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_sn9f","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56092-db5a463d-b22c-4ce3-aec7-51bc1c5090fd-1566236779"}

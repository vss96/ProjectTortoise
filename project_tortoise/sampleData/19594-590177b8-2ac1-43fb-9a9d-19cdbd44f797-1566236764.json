Remember, the reason people send their kids to school right now is that it's mandatory, and public schools is the \"cheapest\" option for any individual family (although in the aggregate it's very expensive).\r\n\r\nOnce school is no longer mandatory *and* the government isn't flooding the market with \"free\" education, people will have a lot more choices for affordable education for their children.  At this point schools will be forced to distingush themselves somehow.  A \"Jesus Camp\" education is a lot less valuable in the workplace or college than a science-based one.\r\n\r\nThe best way to find out the validity of an educational method is to subject it to the force of the market.  Creationism is not valuable knowledge unless you plan on working in the church anyway.  People don't value education now because they feel like it's not costing them anything, but once they have to pay, it will become a lot more important that their children learn something useful.  I think your fears of a nation of young evangelists are unfounded :)","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808204,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuadj","edited":false,"id":"cuam1","author":"asokoloski","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19594-590177b8-2ac1-43fb-9a9d-19cdbd44f797-1566236764"}

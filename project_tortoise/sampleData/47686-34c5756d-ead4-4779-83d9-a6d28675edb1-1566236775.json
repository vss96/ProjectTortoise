{"body":"This guy sounds like he knows nothing about hardware.  He claims Cell is \"evolutionary\" when it's actually revolutionary - a single core with six SPUs - fast vector-processing units (though from what I've read, not as useful for other tasks).  It's a major point of debate whether this design is good for games.  He ignores the GPU debate, where the general consensus has been that the PS3 has a (slightly) less powerful unit compared to the 360.  With the weak sales of the PS3 (look at the prices on eBay now, even pre-Christmas, where no-reserve auctions are getting below-MSRP bids)...it's very hard to claim that the PS3 has a cemented reputation as \"the best\" when it comes to hardware power.\r\n\r\nAlso - the DS did very well because you could use either the stylus or the gamepad inputs.  I wonder if the Wii will utilize the classic controller in the same way, or if designers will have to shoehorn their control schemes to the smaller button array on the Wii.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vtff","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166905037,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"RSquared","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_vtff","edited":false,"id":"cvv8u","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809277,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47686-34c5756d-ead4-4779-83d9-a6d28675edb1-1566236775"}

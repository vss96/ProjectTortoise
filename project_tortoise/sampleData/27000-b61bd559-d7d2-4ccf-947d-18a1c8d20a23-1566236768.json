That's over 50% useable thorium, that will last longer than the sun till it gets to 25% where as uranium only has 0.72% useable fuel and will likely be completely gone before the effect of the suns heating even raises the planets temperature by a degree.\r\n\r\nI don't get what the hell green peace is on about, you could make a house out of Thorium and you'd probably recieve less radiation over your lifetime than in a normal brick house. You're actually more at danger from lead in the environment (just as common) than thorium.\r\n\r\nI really wish someone would shut green peace and the other hippies that are stuck in the 1960's. We're in a different world than they are, they believe we can build zero carbon homes and they're yet to be done and they've made zero serious proposals except promoting the destruction of nature to 'save' nature. They wanted to build wind turbines on moore land in the UK despite them being treated like nature reserves in other countries.","link_id":"t3_uos4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808480,"distinguished":null,"author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_uos4","id":"cupcm","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27000-b61bd559-d7d2-4ccf-947d-18a1c8d20a23-1566236768"}

The extinction of desire at death that Cobain obtained may in part have been motivated by his understanding of Nirvana.  Secondly, people can and do change their tastes and passions.  I've known alcoholics who have been sober for decades.  Some struggle with the desire to drink on a daily basis and rely on a sponsor and the support mechanism provided by AA. Others have used other methods to stay dry and I know one alcoholic who after years of complete sobriety learned to drink in moderation.\r\n\r\nYour understanding of free will is good but I think that you discount the actual experiences of people.  I no longer desire breast milk, but surely did once.  This change I didn't consciously effect, but other changes in desire did result from conscious choice.  I used to prefer beer to wine as an alcoholic beverage with meals.  I chose to take a college class on wine and make the effort to understand wine better.  I educated my palate.  I acquired a genuine appreciation for it and did in fact change what I desired.  I still enjoy beer, but I rarely desire it now, and never with a steak.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166640829,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cviyf","parent_id":"t1_cvi7y","edited":false,"author":"degustibus","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473809042,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41444-c329f774-01a8-4d18-8338-4b6cd5816019-1566236773"}

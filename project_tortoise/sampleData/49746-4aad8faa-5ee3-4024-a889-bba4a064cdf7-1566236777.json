If you don't see this than you lack even basic knowledge about what you're criticizing here.\r\n\r\nOf course you can question the wave nature of the world - but then I'm very curious how you explain experiments like electron scattering.\r\n\r\nAnd I simply think that you don't understand the course of events which leads to the discovery of the QM. In the light of those events some premature conclusions are understandable, even if they looked wrong later. But of course you've never been on a wrong way and always get things right from the beginning and in your godlike perfection its hard to see how mere mortals can err sometimes.\r\n\r\nChaitin was born long after the advent of QM, so even if he's right, it's still stupid to blame Heisenberg&amp;Co for certain misinterpretations they made long before. Science always means to create theories - which often prove as wrong later. But of course you would never say something wrong, you are so confident in your impeccability. But have you ever created something of value? Something which advances science, even if its partly wrong? I suspect not. Better 1000 scientists that err, but also bring new ideas but one winer which is only able to criticize mistakes of others instead of providing new insights himself.\r\n\r\nNon-determinism is a philosophical question, it simply don't falls into the realm of physics. Sure, some physicists wander on different terrain if they do public thinking about philosophical consequences and they often fail. But who cares, as long as they do good work in their prime field of work.\r\n\r\nAnd while QM works best for 'small' things, this still has it's effects on bigger things. All our models for semiconductors for example are based on QM and working perfectly. Without QM you simply can't even explain how a simple transistor works.\r\n\r\nBut that has nothing to to with determinism. The QM is a totally deterministic theory, only the measurement process creates something which many people interpret as non-determinism. IMO this is a mistake, but OTOH it neither makes or breaks physics because for physics it simply doesn't matter if something is really indeterministic or only chaotic beyond every foreseeability.\r\n\r\nAbout 'magic': 300 Years ago, most of out current technology would easily qualify as 'magic'. So the term is clearly depending on someones personal perception and can change over time. Maybe non-locality is 'magic' for you now, but that don't mean that it's magic for everybody.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vk0o","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809355,"author":"kawa","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvzdd","parent_id":"t1_cvyhe","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49746-4aad8faa-5ee3-4024-a889-bba4a064cdf7-1566236777"}

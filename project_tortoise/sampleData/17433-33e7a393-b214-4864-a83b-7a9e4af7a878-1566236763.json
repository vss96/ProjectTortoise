But it's not her job to teach them a lesson.\r\n\r\nThe accident was her fault.  She lied and said she saw an animal.  She performed an action which she *knew* would cause the accident, which makes her *legally* responsible for the accident even if the guy was tailgating. \r\n\r\nShe then lied to the police and insurance companies.  Just like the tailgater deserved to get in an accident, she deserves to suffer the consequences for breaking the law herself.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u62g","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808131,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"travisxt97","id":"cu6qi","parent_id":"t3_u62g","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17433-33e7a393-b214-4864-a83b-7a9e4af7a878-1566236763"}

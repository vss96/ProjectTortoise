The greenhouse theory is an attempt at providing a physical explanation for the correlation. We can leave simulations out of the picture for now. There *is* a correlation between CO2 levels and global mean temparatures and since the dawn of the industrial age the level of CO2 and other GHGs has risen in a relatively short geologic time span to levels not seen in at least 650,000 years. It's mankind's activity during the post industrial age that has lead to the increase.\r\n\r\nModeling and simulation of climate change is a huge and complex task and getting meaningful predictive results from such an effort is not a given, but it doesn't take a PhD in math to extrapolate a correlation and whether or not the greenhouse theory explains the correlation is almost irrelevent. Increase in the level of CO2 implies higher mean temperatures and mankind has been increasingly emitting CO2.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vm6j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166723176,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43667-0a2f2d66-e271-4707-a9b1-26b5cbfadb4c-1566236774"}

Kidnapping an adult to keep her from marrying someone you don't approve of will probably get that girl's parents in trouble with their bishop for committing a felony.\r\nAlso, simply because she was married in the Temple (which means that the guy she was marrying passed a temple recommend interview), there are two cases here.  The first is that the guy she's marrying is an amoral person who lies to his bishop, doesn't feel bad about it, and either doesn't believe in God or doesn't care (something that I have seen happen in my church and it's very sad that a friend of mine got stuck in a bad marriage because of a similar situation).  The second is that the parents are just plain crazy.\r\n\r\nThis isn't an example of religious insanity, it's just an example of insanity in general.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165539372,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14995-c0d150d0-ceab-4f57-96de-3248e380e652-1566236762"}

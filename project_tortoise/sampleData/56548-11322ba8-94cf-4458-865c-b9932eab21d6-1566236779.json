{"body":"You linked to the debate about the link between abortion and crime, but that is not linked to your claim in the way you imply.  It's harder to get an abortion in South Dakota than New York or California, but S.D. has the far lower crime rate.  You linked to the debate about the role Roe v. Wade had in the reduction in crime decades later (crime is increasing again).  You would need to find evidence that current discrepancies in access to abortions correlate with discrepancies in crime rates--you may well find the correlation, but probably not in a way favorable to your assertion.  \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w6ae","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-2,"ups":-2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167387557,"author":"degustibus","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwcfl","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw8v8","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809602,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56548-11322ba8-94cf-4458-865c-b9932eab21d6-1566236779"}

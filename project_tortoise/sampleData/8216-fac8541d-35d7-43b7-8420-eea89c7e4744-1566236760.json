We may argue about Turkey, but Egypt is not a democracy by any means. Not even by its own people's view, which is why only 25% of them actually bothered to vote.\r\n\r\n&gt;You were lying when you said\r\n\r\nReally, that's so elegant. You could say I was *wrong*, but you prefer \"lying\". My guess its because you know very well actually I *wasn't* wrong. (Or that you're rude, or an infanitile fanatic. Take your pick)\r\n\r\n&gt;The fact that in lebanon people are protesting shows you that it's a democracy.\r\n\r\nIn a way, that's true. 800k makes about 20% of Lebanon's population. I wonder if the Christian Fundamentalists would stage a demonstration of 80 million Americans, surrounding the White House and government offices in Washington DC while calling for the President to quit, we'd see it as a sign of US democracy's strength and bright future. Maybe you would, I don't think I would.\r\n\r\n&gt;not till you stop lying and not till you admit that you lied\r\n\r\nAgain, dear malcontent, there's a distinct difference between me claiming something you (mistakenly) think is wrong and lying.

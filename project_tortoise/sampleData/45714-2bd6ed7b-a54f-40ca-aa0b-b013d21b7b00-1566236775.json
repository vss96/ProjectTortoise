We tend to stress conveying the maximum amount of information (IM'ing, texting) in the shortest period of time; usually ignoring grammar in the name of speed. This perhaps might be the evolution (or de-evolution, depending on your POV) of the American language.\r\n\r\n My 2 cents","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45714-2bd6ed7b-a54f-40ca-aa0b-b013d21b7b00-1566236775"}

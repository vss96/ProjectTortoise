I suggest that he and any of your reporters high tail it to the large post office in Norbury SW16.  When I moved here about 12 years ago it was in a delapidated condition and not a penny seems to have been spent on it since.  There is also a large area given over to a shop consisting of poorly filled shelves that has always looked down at heel and under utilised.  Feet stick to the chewing gum on the absolutely filthy floor and the last time I used it, the first weekend of December (a prime weekend for posting Christmas mail), I queued for about 1/2 an hour whilst only one counter was in operation.  Ample opportunity for me to catch the coughs and colds of other queueing customers.  Why I ask you would any person use it if they did not absolutely have to?","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26959-bd76bed6-6402-4ae3-89b1-6af4d9b92021-1566236768"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"True, but the phrase \"a worker's lot in life\", however generally it is intended to extend to workers, is written in the singular: *a* worker. By contrast, the example \"a set of conventional printers' marks\" does not specify whether it refers to an actual single printer, a 'generalized' single printer, or a group of printers (note that I'm not referring to the *marks*, which are pluralized in a set). \r\n\r\nI would conclude from this that either the singular \"printer's marks\" or the plural \"printers' marks\" is technically correct; however, it may be that the conventions of printers (or the convention of the printer, if you prefer) express a preference for one or the other. I don't know enough about printing to argue one way or the other.","link_id":"t3_ti1d","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165261271,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_ctk0k","edited":false,"id":"ctldm","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807730,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7250-32362c7d-5186-456e-938e-85931e87f7e5-1566236760"}

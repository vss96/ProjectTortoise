As we're not going to ban burning things in general, avoid smoke.\r\n\r\nThat's not how it works. Certain *poisonous* toxins in cigarettes are what set it off. It's specifically a cigarette problem, and a fairly common problem at that. With asthma rates skyrocketing, it's going to become even more so.\r\n\r\nI just don't see how anyone should have the right to harm another because of their actions in a public place. If someone got killed because a fire I started in the woods for fun got out of control, it would be tried as murder. The action may not be with the intent to harm another, and the person may even be ignorant of the mere possibility, but that doesn't make it ok that they harmed someone through their own choices.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808365,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuhv5","edited":false,"id":"cuj3o","author":"brendankohler","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24142-6b945f48-b9cc-4aac-8620-088ca4f2c2db-1566236767"}

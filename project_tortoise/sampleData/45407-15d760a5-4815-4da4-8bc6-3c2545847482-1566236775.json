Kurt GÃ¶del thought that your idea had no merit. I'm more inclined to believe his description of numbers than of yours. And I'll give you the reason why.\r\n\r\nWhen you have the sum 1 + 1 = 2 you are most certainly counting actual things. You are applying a set of very specific rules to determine if the physical marks you made on your paper (or computer in this case or even the neurons that are holding the information in your head) follow what we know about how we put objects together and how we group sets of objects. If you didn't mark the variables on some sort of material substrate, you couldn't reason about the symbols to determine if they properly model what we know about how things add up in the universe. And whatever system you use, you will have mathematical truths that you cannot express inside that system.\r\n\r\nIt could be that the quantum information principles that we find working on the lower levels of physics somehow \"cause\" the informational ideals we call numbers to form. Or it could be that the numbers cause the quantum information fields that we observe. Or it could be both. Or neither. No one has any answer to that yet.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vo8v","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45407-15d760a5-4815-4da4-8bc6-3c2545847482-1566236775"}

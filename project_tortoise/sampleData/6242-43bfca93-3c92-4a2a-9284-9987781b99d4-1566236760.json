Why the hell would the dictionary leave out the plant in question, other than to intentionally make it sound like Pandas routinely fire weapons? As the joke is commonly repeated, it is completely unfunny because it's so goddamned confusing. Furthermore, the most glaring error in the phrase \"Eats, shoots and leaves\" is not the placement of the comma but the omission of the word \"bamboo\".\r\n\r\nIs there some office where I can make an official complaint about this?","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6242-43bfca93-3c92-4a2a-9284-9987781b99d4-1566236760"}

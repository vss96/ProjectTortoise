Your children get half their genes from you, and half from the other parent.  If the other parent has some of the same genes as you do, then that's a bonus for you.  A child that's 75% similar to you is worth 50% more than one who's 50% similar.  So the optimal strategy would be to inbreed, up to the point where the negative effects of inbreeding outweigh this benefit.  \r\n\r\nCousin marriage appears to be quite common in a lot of places, and there's one society where uncles marry nieces.  That's as inbred as it gets, AFAIK.  So that gives us an idea of how where the costs outweigh the benefits.\r\n\r\nOf course, this doesn't mean that an inbred child will be healthier or smarter.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tl3j","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807802,"author":"lysine23","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctp6q","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctmsd","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8977-329c58db-c9fe-46dc-86eb-bfd3306af490-1566236760"}

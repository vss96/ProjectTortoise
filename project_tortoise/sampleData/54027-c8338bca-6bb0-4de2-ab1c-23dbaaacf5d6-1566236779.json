However, there are definitely times when a debugger is just the wrong tool for the job. I think with experience most software engineers eventually learn when to apply tools like the debugger/prints/asserts and when to NOT apply them. \r\n\r\nMany times I've been reduced to graph paper pad and pencil while I sit down and go through the code by hand. Other times it's basically a \"what if\" thought experiment where you prod and poke at the code to try and induce the problem in more reproducible way.\r\n\r\nOverall... experience is more valuable than any one tool.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w55v","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","ups":0,"score":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167264670,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54027-c8338bca-6bb0-4de2-ab1c-23dbaaacf5d6-1566236779"}

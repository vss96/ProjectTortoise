Reusability for PHP's object model is crap, too.  Protection is a good thing, an' all, but if that's all you've got going for your object model then there are problems.  Java's protection characteristics are deeply flawed, and they still outdo PHP's.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, thanks to closures, it's entirely possible to achieve much, much greater protection with objects in Perl than you can get in PHP.  It's just not done that way by default.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uvma","subreddit":"programming","ups":1,"score":1,"created_utc":1166298879,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32703-50605d4e-fe5c-4b79-8b19-7ebc847fdcf1-1566236770"}

Can you give an example where this might happen?\r\n\r\nFor instance, moving an email to another folder is something that can be done a variety of ways.  Just because the people without JavaScript can move an email by picking a folder from a drop-down and clicking a button, it doesn't mean the people with JavaScript can't simply drag it to the folder in question and have it move via \"Ajax magic\" without any \"page-centric design\".\r\n\r\nYou are still talking as though this is an either-or proposition.  It simply isn't.  Just because something functions when JavaScript is not available, it doesn't restrict what you can do when JavaScript *is* available.\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165327053,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8878-5e14f117-b677-4838-beec-0e860ba85ce5-1566236760"}

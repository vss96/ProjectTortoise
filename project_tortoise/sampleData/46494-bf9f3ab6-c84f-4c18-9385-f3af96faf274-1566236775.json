You know, \"force OEMs to drink the Kool-Aid\" by only selling PCs pre-installed with Windows, and charging customers for it without letting them opt-out. \r\n\r\n&gt; Elimination of Open Source Hardware Support\r\n\r\nOh, I thought this (among other anti-F/OSS moves) was one of MS's goals for years. Is this a surprise?\r\n\r\n&gt; Decreased System Reliability\r\n\r\n&gt; Disabling of Functionality\r\n\r\n&gt; Indirect Disabling of Functionality\r\n\r\nI thought these were just the eventual result of choosing to run Windows in the first place.

The Kool-Aid will be poo-pooed by many, bally-hooed by some, and nonetheless consumed by the cup-full by the majority.\r\n\r\nRemember, *somebody* is out there right now ordering V1a6Ra from some link they found in an email in their inbox.

{"body":"What Locke said was life, liberty, and property. The pursuit of happiness was put in the Declaration of Independence as a euphemism of sorts. So, it is an intrinsic vital part of freedom that people have individual property rights. This doesn't necessarily translate into more property is better and maybe the \"pursuit\" part of the expression implies this more strongly than \"property\" does, but if property is good, is more property that we are capable of achieving using individual effort also good? It seems like that's the implication.\r\n\r\nSo I would suggest that the problem isn't property or the pursuit of happiness in itself, but the pursuit of property as the expense of happiness i.e. rampant consumerism. Claiming Thomas Jefferson is at fault for this seems a bit of a stretch.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_u4l6","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165611547,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"danteembermage","parent_id":"t3_u4l6","id":"cu60i","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808117,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16989-4130355a-1802-4a3c-98f6-cee74cce0365-1566236763"}

New York is destroyed, along with much of the rest of the world. And the Brits are struggling with a refugee problem. Suicide kits are even part of rations. The movie asks some interesting questions amid a general worst case scenario for life on Earth. \r\n\r\nBut the best part of the film is the music, which blends cover versions of Rolling Stones and Beatles songs amidst songs by Radiohead, Jarvis Cocker, Deep Purple, Donovan Leitch, King Crimson, Roots Manuva, Aphex Twin and the Libertines. Plus, some truly haunted music from John Tavener. This movie is a must hear.","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48860-d171788e-63ba-4a86-9f8e-b3c580c28ec1-1566236777"}

Japan is the least sex having nation in the world according to various surveys. However, they're also the number two economy in the world, which means they have a lot of geeks with money. Geeks with money tend to do weird things, like collect figurines of anime figures and so forth. (I'm sure that people in the Third World wouldn't mind do such things as well, but no cash, no time for collecting junk.) Overtime, the geek market in Japan has sort of feed off of itself, due to media fascination with just how weird they are, and everyone tries to top everyone else in disconnected geekiness. \r\n\r\nStill, if you stack up the average American verus the average Japanese in terms of interest in sex toys and the like, you'll find its far more mainstream for an American girl to have a vibrator than her Japanese counterpart. It's more common for an American husband to have regular sex with his wife than his Japanese counterpart. But the Japanese geeks are weird, and weird grabs attention and makes headlines, so that's what we hear about over here.","link_id":"t3_tify","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807684,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"earthboundkid","edited":false,"id":"ctiup","parent_id":"t1_ctioz","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6134-0c34bd56-c2cb-4325-84d5-0c549d4e3225-1566236760"}

While parental involvement may be one way for students to succeed academically, it's not the only way, so a significant portion of the blame for a low achieving class must lie with the teacher.  I'm not excusing the uninvolved parents, not by a long shot, but I am saying that it's time for teachers of unsuccessful classes to stop being allowed to use the parent's involvement as an acceptable reason to excuse the poor performance of their students.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w17r","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50874-3f7ae633-3b20-4431-868b-404726eb0709-1566236778"}

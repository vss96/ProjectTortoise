How can mutual respect between teachers/students help to curb oversexualization in tweens and teens? The article even quoted a teacher who felt frustrated with what was happening. She had stopped chaperoning school dances because of students' overly sexualized dancing.  She couldn't stop it as a teacher and she could not get any back up from parents or administrators when she thought it should stop. She was powerless as a teacher to do anything about it. \r\n\r\nThis seems more like a SOCIETY issue, than a SCHOOL issue.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809649,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cweh4","id":"cwex7","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57884-93faba2f-df8f-4a01-b4fc-c26aed05afb4-1566236780"}

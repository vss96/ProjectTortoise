He was back tracking on the road they came down, he knew where he was going, but he must have underestimated the distance, had the car still been mobile they would have been fine.  Why he decided to follow a creek instead of staying on the road is a bit of a mystery however.  EDIT: Perhaps he knew there was a river near by that would lead to saftey, and all nearby drainages would eventually lead to that river.  He didn't have much farther to go to get to the lodge.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tvxs","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13932-8858093b-d085-4669-8e1a-d6a1c873f64d-1566236762"}

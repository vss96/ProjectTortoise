It's not perfect, but it has enough there to get you off the ground, so that you can start to pick and choose at more specific tutorials, and perhaps even start reading some [papers](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Research_papers), which are another good source of material.\r\n\r\nAnother easy way to accelerate your learning of Haskell is to come and [join us on IRC](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel) and ask lots of questions. :) I also mention this as a sort of apology for not having written a tutorial myself yet. I've had some ideas for a tutorial brewing in my head for a while now, and have just started outlining things and getting them written.","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166647744,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cvjiv","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvj30","author_flair_text":null,"author":"cgibbard","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809052,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41731-b6cbf49b-260f-43d6-897e-43f8e83eaa47-1566236774"}

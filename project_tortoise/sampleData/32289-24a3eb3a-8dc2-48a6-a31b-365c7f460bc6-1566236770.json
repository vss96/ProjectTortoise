It simply hashes your normal password with the current domain after you enter it. The hash is sent to the website as though you entered it yourself.\r\n\r\nFor example if your password for \"http://reddit.com/\" is \"1234\", then the hash is \"XyCW0j\".  You just have to install the extension on each PC you use, or use the online tool and manually hash the password.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't solve all problems. But it should mean that if your login is intercepted, or the website is compromised, then you only have to worry about *that* site, and not the others which share its password.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808689,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuz0j","id":"cv0jn","author":"joshd","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32289-24a3eb3a-8dc2-48a6-a31b-365c7f460bc6-1566236770"}

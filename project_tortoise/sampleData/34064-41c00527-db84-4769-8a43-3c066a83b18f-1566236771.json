This also means that if you are mildly allergic to caffeine your symptoms should only be half as bad, excluding people who are morbidally allergic but they'd probably kick it before they finished a cup so it's safe to say you aren't.\r\n\r\nI've personally noticed Caffeine makes me more tired, but I think my case is tolerance. I've been drinking tea all my life as well as coke, so I've been exposed to it since I could drink a cup of tea without burning myself (about 5 as far as my memory goes).\r\n\r\nHowever I might try going a week without tea, it seemed to help while I was on holiday. I was drinking copious amounts of coke and coffee, but I strangely seemed more awake. Maybe we become tolerant to the dosage, or it could be that coke and the cappuchinos I was having have tons of sugar in... who knows.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v461","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166375824,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34064-41c00527-db84-4769-8a43-3c066a83b18f-1566236771"}

They have achieved the feat of building something even uglier and tackier than Las Vegas.\r\n\r\n&gt; build the city 300 years ago so that they have architectural heritage?\r\n\r\nAre you so ignorant as to believe the Persian Gulf does not have an architectural heritage adapted to local climate and customs?  They were building magnificent homes and markets with sophisticated cooling techniques when most Europeans still lived in mud huts.\r\n\r\nRather than honor the traditions and wisdom of preceding centuries in the region they built another Las Vegas.  My money says the whole thing will be an abandoned, rusting hulk within 40 years.  Construction like that is uninhabitable and unmaintainable without very cheap energy.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wcfe","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56838-39ff6491-cad2-4f7d-9ed2-70a67f50df7f-1566236779"}

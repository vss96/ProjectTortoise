It is an incomplete dominant gene, and is an allele of the white gene.\r\n\\t\r\n- Type of mutation: Pied is a pattern mutation, and is often represented in genetic crosses as TP.\r\n\\t\r\n- Peacock Coloration: Males appear like regular India Blues except that they are speckled and splotched with white. Exceptional birds will have white on their back and in their train.\r\n\r\n- Peahen Coloration: Hens are also normally colored except for the white splotches.\r\n\\t\r\n- Do they breed true?: No. A pied (TP) times pied (TP) cross will result in 25% of offspring white (TT), 50% pied (TP), and 25% dark pied (PP). Dark pied offspring appear very similar to the India Blue, but white can be found on their wing primaries, and they carry the pied gene. If they are bred to whites, 100% of the offspring will be pied.\r\n\r\nAnd....\r\n\r\n&gt; Besides the India Blue, whites are the most well known peafowl type to non-enthusiasts. Contrary to popular belief, whites are not albinos, because their eyes are blue, not pink.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nConclusion: When you begin researching Peacock species, it is a sign that you need to get a life... :( /*sigh*\r\n","score":15,"ups":15,"created_utc":1166581456,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvfzx","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vesh","author":"rocky_m","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808983,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40010-93b0ab81-cdb8-4f2c-980b-2e1158d63d79-1566236773"}

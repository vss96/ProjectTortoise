But we pay attention to potential because we want achievement. There's no sense in regarding actual achievement as a some kind of given that we don't have the power to change, because we do. Potential is a description of where effort can best be invested to get achievement.  \r\n\r\nI can, for example, regard computers as doorstops because that's all they're good for once I finish hitting them with a hammer. And then, when someone objects, I can say \"Well, it really isn't good for anything but a doorstop. Look, it doesn't work.\" \r\n\r\nBut I would be ignoring the rather obvious fact that what they were trying to express to my limited understanding was \"Stop hitting expensive computers with a hammer, fuckwit!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, if you had been paying closer attention, you might have noticed that my original conclusion was, in fact, \"Don't send your kids to public school.\"\r\n\r\nSo allow me to clarify. \r\n\r\nSchools, and especially public schools, are loser training facilities. They train people to be losers. So don't send your kid to one. Because it will either train them to be losers, or at least make them have a much harder time not being losers than they otherwise would have.","link_id":"t3_w4pi","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"53939-37e0f194-fd72-415b-ad2f-5496c8363577-1566236779"}

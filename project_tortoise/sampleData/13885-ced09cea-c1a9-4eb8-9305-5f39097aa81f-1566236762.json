They let video games and TV \"mind\" their kids because they are too self involved to spend the time they need with their kids.  This \"needed\" time, it is needed for the kids.  If you don't spend it, you get a random outcome.  Sometimes good, sometimes bad.\r\n\r\nThe sometimes bad is what the linked article is about.  My point is that the majority of people that need that remedy are bad parents **to start with** and that fix is a patch on errors made **many years before**.\r\n","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_twhc","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807997,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"e40","parent_id":"t1_ctzl9","id":"ctzlt","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13885-ced09cea-c1a9-4eb8-9305-5f39097aa81f-1566236762"}

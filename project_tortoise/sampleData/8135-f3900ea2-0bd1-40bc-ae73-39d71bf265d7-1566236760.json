The EU does not want them!\r\n\r\nCome on, read the news: http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=EU+Turkey&amp;btnG=Search+News\r\n\r\n&gt;Are they or are they not?\r\n\r\nVery much not. Read a little about Egypt (you might start with Wikipedia). BTW it's interesting to note that Egypt recieves the largest US financial aid, and yet in a real democratic election the strongly anti-US Muslim Brothers would probably gain much power. Challenges the assumption that people in the Mid East oppose the US because it wronged them.\r\n\r\nI'm glad you mentioned Lebanon. It was widely reported (though not in Reddit, how astonishing) this week that Hezbollah mounted an 800k people demonstration demanding to overthrow the government (on basis of its insistence to investigate the murder of Rafiq el Hariri, almost certainly by the Syrian Military Intelligence). This also relates to Palestine in that a democratic elections there will also likely result in rise to power of a very undemocratic, fundamental party. \r\n\r\nIt's a very unfortunate situation, but that's just how things are, and we might as well recognize it.","score":-2,"ups":-2,"created_utc":1165287411,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctn6n","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctmoj","author":"bhr","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807765,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8135-f3900ea2-0bd1-40bc-ae73-39d71bf265d7-1566236760"}

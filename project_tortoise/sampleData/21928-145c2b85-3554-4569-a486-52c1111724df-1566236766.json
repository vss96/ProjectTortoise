For example, 100 people get off a train and all need to cross a small bridge to exit the station. You're hemmed in by the crowd, and have no alternative but to continue walking slowly directly into the space occupied just before by smokers; you might as well light up yourself.\r\n\r\nBus stops, or other small shelters with limited space, when it's raining, are pretty bad too. The rain seems to act like a wall.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty much against banning stuff, and would be even more strongly against any ban which went beyond fines towards prison time, so I agree with you in the main, just not with your specific point about outdoor smoking.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21928-145c2b85-3554-4569-a486-52c1111724df-1566236766"}

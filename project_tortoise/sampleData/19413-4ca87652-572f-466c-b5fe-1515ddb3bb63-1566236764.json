In post-WWI, the Germans, once a proud nation with amazing innovations ahead of other countries of the time, were depleted to nothing and the reconstruction was failing. Meanwhile, the communists were working their way through Germany. Also, many Jews of the time in Germany were like USA-style capitalists, which was very un-German at the time. They were social outcasts except in their own cliques, and so they banded together and formed kinds of cartels for products that I'm sure angered many Germans. On the other side of the spectrum, there was the obvious lies of the communists, and many Germans feared that too. With all this chaos, Hitler represented a return to German strength again. He offered the breakup of capitalist cartels, and the defense against the lies of the communists. So it was an enticing idea to the people. Communists were also like devious rats at the time, invading many posts in the government, and the people sought a really strong power to fight it off.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate how it all played out, though, isn't it? Hitler, a madman before he even was thrown in prison, rounded up the communists and the Jews and slaughtered them as well as used them for medical experiments.\r\n\r\nIn any kind of oppression, we humans tend to latch on to these cults of personality to overcome our hardships, and put all our hopes and dreams in them, even ignoring or covering up their sometimes unethical nature, sometimes even hideous monster nature, even giving up many of our fundamental liberties, just to keep the dream alive.\r\n\r\nCapitalism has its excesses and can create situations of a depleted middle class, where the poor get poorer and the rich get richer.\r\n\r\nSocialism has its excesses where promises are built on taxes but provides an extremely inefficient return.\r\n\r\nLittle \"c\" communism has its excesses where it is never carried out completely because the leaders suddenly discover that people must be controlled because they are inherently lazy by nature.\r\n\r\nBig \"C\" Communism has its excesses where people are controlled and made to believe it is little \"c\" communism, but are basically serfs in a regime much like a monarchy that they sought to overcome. And then they realize that there's no profit incentive, where the slow worker is paid just as much as the efficient or fast worker, and so the whole system breaks down eventually unless it is propped up with force. And that force gets very expensive to the point it cannot survive.\r\n\r\nA monarchy is obviously not the right solution because it is hogwash to give so many taxes to a bunch of elitist set of well-paid hand wavers.\r\n\r\nTo me, the best solution is a socialist capitalist state because it keeps capitalism in check in a kind of ethical capitalism. Unfortunately, however, where do you draw the line where the socialist control is too oppressive, or the capitalist control is so unbound and unethical? Another problem we have is that parties end up latching on to either style of government and we end up in legislative gridlock, massive division of the people, violent uprisings, or unbelievable flip-flops on idealogy.","link_id":"t3_u9g8","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165715357,"score":5,"ups":5,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19413-4ca87652-572f-466c-b5fe-1515ddb3bb63-1566236764"}

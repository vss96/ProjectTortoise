I'm a vegetarian (by birth/family/grandma's wish) but I always tell my meat eating friends to keep eating their salamis and steaks. If all of a sudden every person in the world wanted apples and oranges, the demand would be so huge, it would push me out of the market i.e. make things too expensive for me to afford. There is only so much land in the world to grow fruits and vegetables so obviously when demand rises, so does the price. Initially.\r\n\r\nThe second phase is once the suppliers realize there is indeed a huge untapped demand for goods at a slightly lower price, they will figure out a way to reduce costs, in this case, by employing the economies to scale to produce a lot more than they were originally by making better use of technology and capital resources. So once the orange plantation owner realizes the entire world wants his oranges, he will get a $2m loan to automate the orange picking process, thereby cutting costs in the long run and selling cheaper oranges of similar quality.\r\n\r\nWhile initial rise in demand is a short-term event, the supply side expansion is a long-term process and takes years/decades. However, since supply is driven by demand in the food industry, we as consumers just have to change our demands and in time, the suppliers will indeed make the necessary investments to give us what we want at the price we want.\r\n\r\nHere's hoping :)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tol1","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9042-c876b571-aed4-4eed-9275-ab564c681497-1566236760"}

Largest in the US and 5th largest in the world.  Most US agriculture commodities flow out of New Orleans and most of the industrial commodities (at least for the midwest) flow in (e.g. steel for the auto makers in Detroit).  There aren't really any cost effective alternatives to shipping, so you have to have the functioning ports there.  You have to have people to run the ports (not to mention the oil and gas resources in the area) so, therefore, you have to have New Orleans.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27260-be8c9f5e-bab9-4da4-bd78-8b05f1b2904f-1566236768"}

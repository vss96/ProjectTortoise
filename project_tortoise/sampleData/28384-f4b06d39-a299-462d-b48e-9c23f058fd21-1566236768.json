However if you use an RGB combination of LEDs it's hard to balance it to give white light and you're fucked because the blue one will burn out too quickly.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to know what method it uses and if this is measured before or after any additions like phosphors. If this is before additions then it'll drop the efficency to around 80 lumens as phosphors mean it's only about 30% efficent, that is if you want people to be able to buy one.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808537,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cusfr","parent_id":"t1_cusax","author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28384-f4b06d39-a299-462d-b48e-9c23f058fd21-1566236768"}

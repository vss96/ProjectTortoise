Physics is the study and the description of *reality*. Numbers on a page mean nothing unless they relate to reality. Most physicists throughout the 20th century have gotten it through their heads somehow that numbers on a page are \"physics\" even if they have no link to reality. Except they aren't. Numbers on a page are a meaningless shuffling of arbitrary symbols and that makes them *mathematics*. Once you add the \"philosophy\" which physicists scorn, *then* you have physics.\r\n\r\nThe Copenhagen \"interpretation\" wasn't an interpretation of a physical theory. It WAS the physical theory. And it was *ludicrous* fucking *gibberish*. Furthermore, Copenhagen didn't \"just somehow stuck\", it was rammed through on the personal authority of Niels Bohr. It's important for you to understand who and what to blame. And especially how much politics was involved. People have this ridiculous notion that physicists are too objective to be tarnished by politics. Except they're not. Physicists are no more trustworthy than economists.","created_utc":1166735560,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44257-d4a303ee-0806-4452-8316-83668a952c27-1566236774"}

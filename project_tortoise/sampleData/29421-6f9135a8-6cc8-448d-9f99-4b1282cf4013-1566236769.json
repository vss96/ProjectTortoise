If they are free thinkers, they hide it, because theyâ€™re after top grades and independent thinking is too risky and unpredictable.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to spout this kind of stuff, but I think I mostly agree with you. I can recall a small number of cases in high school where I deliberately wrote what the teacher wanted to see, against my personal convictions. For example, with *[Inherit The Wind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherit_the_Wind#Inherit_the_Wind_and_history)*; regardless of whether or not YEC is nonsense, the portrayal of the two lawyers is intolerably snide. But the grades were there for the taking, if you were willing to expound on the platitudes distilled out of pseudo-historical events presented as reality.\r\n\r\nAs for the remark about social skills: I was home-schooled until grade 7, and for a number of years after that, I was indeed socially awkward. I'm still a shy person inside, but I deliberately push myself to *not be*, and I think that deliberate pushing is the most important part. A lot of people trick themselves into never socializing by just claiming to being introverts and then staying that way.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166144878,"score":8,"ups":8,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29421-6f9135a8-6cc8-448d-9f99-4b1282cf4013-1566236769"}

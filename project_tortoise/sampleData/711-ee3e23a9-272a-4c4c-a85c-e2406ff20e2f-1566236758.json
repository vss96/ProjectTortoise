{"body":"&gt; Yeah, but the lambda returned from the slavaiswrong function cannot mutate the lexical variable a, so I'm right, as always.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna call BS on this; plenty of pure functional languages have closures but make it hard or impossible to mutate _any_ variable, closure or no.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the fact remains that a piece of code is accessing a variable which normally would be out of scope, but which was preserved or \"closed over\". Hence, it's a closure and no amount of weaseling will make you right.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t1qf","subreddit":"programming","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1164954316,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"ubernostrum","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ct747","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct68e","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807464,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"711-ee3e23a9-272a-4c4c-a85c-e2406ff20e2f-1566236758"}

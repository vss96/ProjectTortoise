{"body":"&gt; other boys to recognize you're a sissy and beat you up for it\r\n\r\nAmong little boys, there have been nerds and bullies since the beginning of time..(or the playground or school buses).. That has never had anything to do with sexual preference.. (Not all boys other 5 yr olds call \"sissy\" are gay and not all bullies are straight.. \r\n\r\nThe question/exclamation in above comment (by ehcolem) is valid.. Age 5 is a little too early to know/realize your sexual preference.. (As a 5yr old little boy, the pastor might have confused \"experimentation\"/\"exploration\" with sexual preference.. (this may be called something else, link to come))\r\n\r\n(While I am not accusing you of homophobic, calling gays as \"sissy\" is a little disparaging.. What about those tough macho ones..?? (You know, all those buff-tanned-manicured male-models my girlfriend thinks of while in bed with my fat ass..:) ) \r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n****AND MORE IMPORTANTLY***, How did a 5yr old know homosexuality is a sin??? Do they (evangelicals) teach that homophobic crap to 5yr old boys and girls????","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uhv4","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":12,"score":12,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165897288,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rocky_m","id":"cuixp","parent_id":"t1_cuivt","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808360,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24036-0f77d956-6910-4c78-a135-cd36ff80454f-1566236767"}

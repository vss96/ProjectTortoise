Frankly, Python might be a great language with a huge library - but the significant whitespace still turns me away, four years after I first started playing with it.\r\n\r\nI always properly indent my code in other languages, so that is not the issue - the issue is that the significant whitespace is a *straight-jacket*.  And besides that, it does not delineate blocks nearly as clearly (visually) as curly braces do.  If someone writes a loop long enough to be off the screen, in vi I can match curly braces (or parentheses) by pressing %.  In Python, such a task is a mite less intuitive - thought I'll admit, that may be a relatively simple editor function to implement.\r\n\r\nI've no reason to switch to a language that has such a *systemic* (from my perspective) flaw, almost regardless of the benefits.  I've had to fix copy-pasted Python code before, and it was a royal pain.  Braces are not so ugly that their elimination is worth that pain.","score":-6,"ups":-6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165876236,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23398-f889effd-3aa5-475b-b603-9c99a0adf94a-1566236766"}

My collection is huge and for that I have spend much money. Recently I have been listening free stream stations such as Pandora, SomaFM and many others that can save your music preferences playing all the time your music. I don’t pay a cent for this and music quality is great. I also notice music CD’s are now inexpensive comparing to a few years back. I think it was just matter of time before people started using all this alternatives saving money. Ignorance is bliss.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ujny","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25155-6ca2d4df-9cdf-43f3-9044-eb2a873fdce7-1566236767"}

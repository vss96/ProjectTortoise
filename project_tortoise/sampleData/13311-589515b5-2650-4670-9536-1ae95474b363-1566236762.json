The 85 line Haskell program was written by the author of the paper; the C++ program was written by a \"program manager\" who also added a \"test harness\" after trying to write the damn thing in awk.  This sounds like the classic case of someone who writes notoriously baroque, overwrought code.\r\n\r\nThe paper itself even makes this argument:\r\n\r\n\"This simple use of higher-order functions, quite obvious to the experienced functional programmer, was not used in any of the other prototypes, even though some of the languages support higher-order functions.\"\r\n\r\nGet it?  The other programmers did not use this technique because they didn't know it, or failed to recognize its utility.  Experts, my ass - they may have known their language, but they weren't good programmers.\r\n\r\nThe real benefit comes from understanding functional techniques, NOT from using functional languages.","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13311-589515b5-2650-4670-9536-1ae95474b363-1566236762"}

{"body":"If you are getting your opinions from an 800-word BBC summary, I suggest you dig further. They are saying, essentially, that all these damn poor black people are making their job harder, and that abstinence training doesn't work. But then they drop this turd:\r\n\r\n&gt; \"No country has ever raised itself out of poverty without stabilising population growth...\" \r\n\r\nUm, right... except the US, Canada, Japan, and every other country that has sucessfully industrialised. India's growth rate was the same as Ethiopia's **until 1985**, when it dropped to \"Western\" levels. Population control is a result, not a condition, of raising people out of poverty. \r\n\r\nThe reason normally-smart people say things like this is a bit of a taboo, a bit of doublethink. The dirty little secret is that they **don't** want to encourage poor countries to develop in the same way theirs did. \r\n\r\nThe Reason: A country that industrialises **and** has a surplus population tends to get into big wars with its neighbors. Again witness India, who picked a fight with Pakistan less than 5 years after it became a net exporter of food and is currently in a 3-way nuclear standoff.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_qdh2","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165943729,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"aristus","id":"culau","parent_id":"t1_cu57t","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808405,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25133-0c7d9897-6a3b-40c9-8257-1d56f44022a8-1566236767"}

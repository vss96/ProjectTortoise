The target render didn’t even look like it was meant to be game play. It looked more like a cinematic. It didn’t even seem like they were pretending that it was actual game play footage. Should we have been pissed because the ascetics of the cinematics in FF VII were way better than the actual game play? It happens with almost every game. And in the circumstances where the developer actually does claim that the video is what game play should look like, most people already know that the game companies try to go too big and usually have to scale down.

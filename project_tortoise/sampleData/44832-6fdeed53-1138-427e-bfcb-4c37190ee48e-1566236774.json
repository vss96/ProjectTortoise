I said that if you shoot, shoot to kill.  Don't do this pansy ass foot shooting crap.\r\n\r\nIf I have the shot, I'll aim where I was taught to aim in a certification course for working as an armed guard: the mouth area.  It's probably a slower death than a heart or brain shot, but it's a pretty damned certain death -- and it's more sure to stop the guy than any other shot with a handgun at close range.  About the only thing that would dissuade me would be if there are bystanders behind him.  Then I'd fall back on the Army training -- aim center mass.\r\n\r\nEither way, I'd be shooting to kill.  I'd avoid shooting if I reasonably could, but once I make the decision to pull the trigger, it's him or me.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vjjh","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166757265,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44832-6fdeed53-1138-427e-bfcb-4c37190ee48e-1566236774"}

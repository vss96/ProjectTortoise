Why assume that any single economic area should step up?\r\n\r\nThe US had the dollar as *the* reserve currency. The demand for the reserve currency causes massive deflation. It virtually enforces consumption on the host nation, how can you produce things if you cost twice as much as everyone else. Everything else becomes cheap so you consume.\r\n\r\nHence a need for an independent currency or gold. It'll probably be the Euro in the meantime.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vc4j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808922,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"css1971","id":"cvcul","parent_id":"t1_cvcmd","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38259-9c0fbffd-4a52-4a5c-a404-5237b3a031ea-1566236772"}

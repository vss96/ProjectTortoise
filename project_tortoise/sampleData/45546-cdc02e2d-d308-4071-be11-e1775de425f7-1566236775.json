It is impossible to prove or disprove it and thus invisible pink unicorns both logically exist and don't. It's a paradox, much as the existance of god.\r\n\r\nDisproving something is identical to proving the opposite of a scientific statement. They're interchangeable. Research into proving the existance of invisible pink unicorns is also research into disproving it, until you get your results you're attempting to do both to prove or disprove your hypothesis of the non-existance of invisible pink unicorns.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm saying is that unlike god, reincarnation has a basis in the real world and thus a scientific study could be performed to prove/disprove it.\r\n\r\nI don't actually believe this story is true, [here's](http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/boywholived/) a link to the channels site. I've seen a few documentaries on the outer hebrides, so I don't find it hard to believe he could have heard most of his stuff when he was still young.\r\n\r\nHowever the selection process for the current Dalai Lama meant he had to pick 3 items out of 12 (IIRC) that actually belonged to the prior Dalai Lama and hadn't been placed there by his monks. As there were also 3 kids chosen to be tested that means they had roughly a 1 in 73 chance of one of them guessing right. \r\n\r\nIf there's a possible 3 kids every time then the chance of one of the 14 Dalai Lamas getting in purely by chance is still 1 in 5. Even anecdotally these are pretty hard figures to shake and should be tested scientifically. It shouldn't be a hard test either, the chances of a kid getting it right are 1 in 220, they're far less likely to guess right than in an ESP test.","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166804258,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45546-cdc02e2d-d308-4071-be11-e1775de425f7-1566236775"}

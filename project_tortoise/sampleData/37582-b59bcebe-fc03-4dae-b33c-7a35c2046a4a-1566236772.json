It's not common knowledge how backwards much of their culture still is, when compared to America, at least.\r\n\r\nWe recently discovered it is [not uncommon] for superior officers to rape their female subordinates in the military. Some of you might know that military service is _mandatory_ there, you do the math.\r\n\r\nIsraelis are so defensive because of external pressure, they have yet to deal with all their (very real) internal problems. With time they definitely will though. While we're waiting, there's no need to defend the horrible aspects of their culture that remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vat3","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808893,"author":"staunch","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvbad","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vat3","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37582-b59bcebe-fc03-4dae-b33c-7a35c2046a4a-1566236772"}

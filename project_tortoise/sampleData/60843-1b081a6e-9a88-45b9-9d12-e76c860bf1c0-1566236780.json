There was some corruption which required me to reinstall windows. System would not boot to desktop in less than 20 minutes. Each time I wanted to open explorer windows or anything showing the file system, 20 more minutes.\r\n\r\nBut, not so simple. I have a raid card, no floppy drive. Was I to buy a disk drive and disk just to load a 20 k driver , which i already had on disc?\r\n\r\nI put the ubuntu live disc inside the machine, and it started up and worked. Installed, and was ready to go. I don't really like windows or linux (which is too much configuring of stuff to keep me calm), but I'd be damned if i was gonna buy a floppy drive just to reinstall an OS that broke on it's own. And with all my hardware changes, I was sure to have a copy that wouldn't pass as the same original machine.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wjvh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167602466,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60843-1b081a6e-9a88-45b9-9d12-e76c860bf1c0-1566236780"}

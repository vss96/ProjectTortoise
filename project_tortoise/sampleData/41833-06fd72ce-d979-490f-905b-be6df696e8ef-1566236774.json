Which is *much* more time-consuming and error-fraught.\r\n\r\nNot to mention, it assumes that people are better at writing check-in comments than they are at commenting code, which I would deeply question.\r\n\r\nFinally, it ignores the issue of 'why this particular method' or 'what is this complex code doing'. Sometimes you just are doing something complex (say, spline interpolation of quaternions) and you might want to attach a note (e.g. 'Taken from Watt's _Rendering and Animation_, using weights as defined by blah blah') Or mention that initialization is already done. Or whatever.\r\n\r\nBad programmer.

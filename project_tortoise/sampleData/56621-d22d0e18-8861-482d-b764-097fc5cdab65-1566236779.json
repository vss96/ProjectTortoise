{"body":"Funny, I recently bought and read \"The poverty of Historicism\" and \"The open society and its enemies\". I'm basically arguing straight from the second of these: science as we practice it today is a human institution, just like banking, social security, insurance, legislative assemblies, etc. This is quite independent from questions of falsifiability. \r\n\r\nYou may have noticed that I said that fundamentalists trust people for the wrong reasons and in the wrong fields. My reason for asserting that is that _I_ think we should apply the scientific method (for instance regarding falsifiability) where we can. But this reason is itself not an assertion that can be falsified.\r\n\r\nI also disagree that \"the non expert can start to study and test every theory and that happens a lot.\", on much the same basis that one economist argued that no single person knows how to make a pencil. You may think that _in theory_ they could, if given infinite time, but you base that theory on your trust in the institution of science. (Which isn't misplaced, though)\r\n\r\nI recommend some basic Socrates ;-)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w8sr","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167396607,"author":"vintermann","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cwc9o","edited":false,"id":"cwcmw","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809606,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56621-d22d0e18-8861-482d-b764-097fc5cdab65-1566236779"}

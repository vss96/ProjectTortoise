I had been playing around with Python and generally enjoying it, and then I went to fix a bug in someone else's rather large program to find that he had mixed tabs and spaces. Tab first, then all space indents from there on in. I tell this story every time I get to chatting with someone who adores python, and they all admit that \"yeah, that sucks, you should just reformat it or yell at them\". That wasn't an option, and I basically gave up on fixing the bug because it was so insanely frustrating. I'm not unwilling to use python or anything, but this experience really affected how I look at the language.\r\n\r\nWhitespace isn't a problem when people are actually using it correctly, but when it's abused it's even harder to deal with than poor formatting.","link_id":"t3_uhgd","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23374-28202e98-3551-4e54-be7c-b82d4b83eb18-1566236766"}

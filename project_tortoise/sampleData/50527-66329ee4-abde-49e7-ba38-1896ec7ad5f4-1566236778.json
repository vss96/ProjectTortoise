{"controversiality":0,"body":"the 'c++ concurrency without locking' thing the C++ committee is contemplating is way too complex for general use. it may be useful in carefully tested libraries but forget about your general programmer using it. Most programmers can't even get mutexes right. The approach of using shared memory resources as a general purpose architecture is a bad idea. Emulating Erlang message passing using carefully constructed libraries is a good approach if you must use C++.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_vzyw","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","ups":3,"score":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167103585,"author":"dmh2000","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vzyw","id":"cw0x6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809385,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50527-66329ee4-abde-49e7-ba38-1896ec7ad5f4-1566236778"}

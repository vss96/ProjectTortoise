{"controversiality":0,"body":"I've worked in both food service and retail customer service positions, and I have plenty of experience with asshole customers.  I always used to cringe when they'd say \"the customer is always right\" when I tried to explain why I couldn't just give them whatever they wanted.\r\n\r\nI don't think the phrase \"the customer is always right\"  should be a license for people to act like jerks towards service employees.  \r\n\r\nThe phrase isn't at fault, it's how it's been interpreted by both businesses and the public. \r\n\r\nFrom the business's point of view, \"the customer is always right\" *should* mean that to stay in business, you have sell those goods or services that customers want to buy; i.e. when a customer says he wants a blue widget, you don't sell him a green one, you figure out how to make blue widgets.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately both businesses and customers have turned it around so now it means \"Customers are never wrong.\"  The attitude that, \"I can act however I please since I'm the customer, and therefore always right\", only serves to reward people who are jerks, make employees unable to stand up for themselves out of fear of losing their jobs, and turn managers into \"kowtowing corporate whore[s]\".","link_id":"t3_upgw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166094816,"score":38,"ups":38,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"emiller40","parent_id":"t3_upgw","edited":false,"id":"cur3j","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808511,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27784-0195804d-8ce1-48cb-9a0a-e10973402cdf-1566236768"}

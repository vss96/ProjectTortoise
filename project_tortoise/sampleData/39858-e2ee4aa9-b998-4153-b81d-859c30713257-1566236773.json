How are we past 100 hours, WHEN THE DEM CONGRESS HAS NOT EVEN BEEN SWORN IN YET?\r\n\r\nLast time I checked the Pelosi run house doesn't begin until the next congress in mid January! So at best you are either very uninformed or dishonest. The current speaker of the house at this time remains Denny Hastert, who last time I checked wasn't going to be either investigating other republicans or implementing the Pelosi agenda.\r\n\r\nAs for the Foley investigation, that was bipartisan and was set up by republican speaker Hastert and his office. To call the dem investigation is not true. The dem member of the Page committee was **explicitly not informed of the existence of the scandal** and then denied access to the details of the allegations by the republican controlled page committee.\r\n\r\nWould you like me to site other dem investigation that were attempted in the minority?

MapQuest generally gives me the most sane/logical directions.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, I wanted to buy a GPS (TomTom/Garmin) for my car but didn't have the money so bought a $14 Atlas instead. That was the best $14 I ever spent. Not only did I discover that \"Stephen Foster State Park\" in GA/FL-border that shows up on Google Maps is the enchanted \"Okefenokee Swamp\" that I always wanted to visit, but also learned about tons of kayaking trails, camping sites, and national parks.\r\n\r\nI'm not criticizing James Kim (RIP bro) but just saying, sometimes a $14 old tech manual can teach you more than a $500 hi-tech gizmo. I love science &amp; technology and spend 10 hrs a day coding/designing but I do my best to not wholly rely on gadgets for my survival.\r\n\r\nIt is probably not a sad coincidence that Kim loved his gadgets a lot and quite possibly trusted them with his and his family's life. He was indeed a great father and husband and it's sad to see that simply because Google Maps had a slightly different algorithm, he lost his life.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808084,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_u3q9","edited":false,"id":"cu4bk","author_flair_text":null,"author":"chime","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16054-2ec579af-e626-4a76-9642-846ab8b9b42e-1566236763"}

Clearly, if he is wrong, (and if we go a step further and she is right) then he will die, find out, and go to hell (assuming that her idea of God is accurate, and God is so insecure that he bases your eternal salvation upon whether or not you believed in him). His response is appropriate because he is pointing out what a silly question she is asking; it's equally possible that she is wrong, but she doesn't take that into account because her faith is so unshakeable, and she is so CLEARLY CORRECT.\r\n\r\nYour risk/benefit analysis is very apropos; many theists say \"well, if you're wrong, you're going to hell, but if I'm wrong, nothing happens.\" For them, the benefits of believing outweigh the cost of nonbelief, according to this argument. Forgetting for a moment that \"belief\" and \"faith\" are not things you can force upon yourself, atheists tend to argue, and this is what I think Dawkins is pointing out, that the cost of wasting what little time he does believe he has is not worth the infinitesimally small chance that he will get an Eternal-Happiness-in-Jesus'-Garden type of payoff.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uzof","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808716,"distinguished":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cv1m9","id":"cv1wh","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32787-5b43b6c4-ca28-4b66-945d-8f0dca6340cc-1566236770"}

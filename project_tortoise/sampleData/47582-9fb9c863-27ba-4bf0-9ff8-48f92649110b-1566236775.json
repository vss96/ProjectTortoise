The [American Federation of Musicians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Musicians) has 45,000 members, of which 15% are full-time professional musicians. That's 6,750 right there, and there are probably many more full-time musicians who aren't in the AFM. There's more music than just the stuff you can buy at Best Buy or hear on the radio, and modern professional music is more than just the singer or the band as well- You have session musicians, recording engineers, arrangers, composers, etc, etc. Some works of art require more than one or two people to make.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166899884,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47582-9fb9c863-27ba-4bf0-9ff8-48f92649110b-1566236775"}

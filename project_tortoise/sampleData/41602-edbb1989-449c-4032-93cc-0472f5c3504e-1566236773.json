It is doubtful the world population will ever get over ten billion, unless we more or less stop dying due to medical advances that radically extend life. Then it will get \"interesting\", in the sense of the \"old Chinese curse\" (apocryphal?): *May you live in interesting times*.\r\n\r\nIn Japan's case they have the added problem of how to approach those fromt he opposite sex without seeming rude. Seriously. This tends to cut down on singles getting together, getting married, and having kids and living happily ever after.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166644238,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41602-edbb1989-449c-4032-93cc-0472f5c3504e-1566236773"}

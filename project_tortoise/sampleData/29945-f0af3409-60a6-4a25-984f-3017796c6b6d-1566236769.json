The irresponsibility (and there is some) was allowing our data to get nabbed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reddit folks are being polite 1. in informing people about this incident and 2. about addressing the problem (hashing passwords)\r\n\r\nIt will be really nice if you are equally polite in your requests/suggestions.. However, this post, in all probability seems a karma-whoring attempt and not a serious request (as this matter is already taken care of..)\r\n\r\nReddit is a FREE service..If you feel that violated by some missing functionality [(or your false assumptions)](http://reddit.com/info/ut89/comments/cuvfg) feel free to FUCK OFF!\r\n\r\n","controversiality":1,"score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166168319,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuvgy","parent_id":"t3_uvet","edited":false,"author":"rocky_m","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808593,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29945-f0af3409-60a6-4a25-984f-3017796c6b6d-1566236769"}

You're holding out on the really fun examples.\r\n\r\nLike a family of bird species where A can breed with B can breed with C can breed with D can breed with E can breed with A. BUT A can't breed with C.\r\n\r\nOr grasses. Hmmm, grass, wonderful grass, so easily hybridizable. Modern wheat has the genomes of three of its precursor species. Reverse-speciation!\r\n\r\nBut to address one of your points, there *is* a meaning to \"a different species\". The fact that it's fuzzy and not digital is quite irrelevant.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21709-da0953b5-e839-45b9-8588-f794635faa41-1566236766"}

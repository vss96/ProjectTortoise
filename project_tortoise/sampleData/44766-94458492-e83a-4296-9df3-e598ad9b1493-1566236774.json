The reality is, the same thing is happening in the United States - cheaper goods made abroad (usually because of lower labor costs) allow Americans to buy those things at less cost, but contribute to the loss of jobs and industries here.  The overall effect has been that working Americans' wages and standard of living have stagnated.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm not advocating for free trade.  I just find it funny when the impact of globalization on poor people is viewed so differently based on whether those poor people live in a wealthy or poor nation.","score":7,"ups":7,"created_utc":1166753783,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44766-94458492-e83a-4296-9df3-e598ad9b1493-1566236774"}

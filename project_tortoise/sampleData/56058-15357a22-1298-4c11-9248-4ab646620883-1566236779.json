That certain samples of earth have similar ratios of composition and radiation to meteorites is hardly direct, in any normal sense of the word.\r\n\r\n&gt; Infinity and ratios don't work that way.\r\n\r\nExactly.  If infinity occurs in your answer, then you know that your theory is wrong.  Your theory (that of comparing ratios of quantities) produces infinities, so is cleary wrong.  Maybe your theory has other merits that make it worth considering despite these obvious failures - if so, state them.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56058-15357a22-1298-4c11-9248-4ab646620883-1566236779"}

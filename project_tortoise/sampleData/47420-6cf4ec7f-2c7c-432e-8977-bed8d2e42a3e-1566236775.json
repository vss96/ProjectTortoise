In reality though, Nintendo is doing its best not to compete head on with either Sony or Microsoft. They're trying to forge their own market niche and expand the video game market in general. They're going after girls, adults, and everyone else that has no interest in a PS3 or 360. If Nintendo is successful, then the market might very well support more than 2.5 consoles this generation. Let Sony and MS duke it out for the \"hardcore\" gamers, meanwhile Nintendo will go after the people who bought a DS.\r\n\r\nHe also delivers his verdict based entirely on the technical power of the PS3, but I think that's pretty unlikely. First of all, the most powerful system isn't always the winner. The Sega Genesis beat the SNES for most of that generation despite Sega having the weaker hardware. The N64 was the superior system to the Playstation in everything but storage space. So I'd say it's hardly a given that the best hardware wins.\r\n\r\nWhat does predict the winner? Software. Games drive console sales, and that's something Sony is having a hard time with this time around - they've been losing a steady stream of exclusives as developers choose to go multi-platform, at which point Sony's price is really going to hurt them. If you can play the games you want on a $600 or a $400 console, which one will you choose?\r\n\r\nI think that once the initial fanboys have gotten their hands on the PS3, it's going to be a tough sell to everyone else.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vtff","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166893722,"score":8,"ups":8,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47420-6cf4ec7f-2c7c-432e-8977-bed8d2e42a3e-1566236775"}

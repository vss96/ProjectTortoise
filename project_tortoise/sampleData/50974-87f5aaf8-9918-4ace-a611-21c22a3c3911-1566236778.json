{"body":"While I agree with the general drift of the article (basically, Vista will make everyone bend over and take it for DRM, including hardware manufacturers), and I agree this is wrong, unfortunately, not *all* of the blame lies with early adopter consumers.\r\n\r\nI think very very few people would chose Vista of their own free will. The evil back door is that all new computers will come out with it on, per default, and then the cancer is in the system. (Oh, this product only works with Vista, oh, these office files on Vista can't be opened in XP).  That's the real problem, and until either OEMs, or businesses start saying 'no' and sticking with older (or other OSs) we'll continue to be at MS's mercy.\r\n\r\nGrrr.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping Vista will be the push that sends the masses to Mac or Linux, and that both (especially Linux, say, for games) improve because of it. Yes, I'm working pretty hard to find that silver lining.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w1i0","subreddit":"programming","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1167131417,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"jbstjohn","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_w1i0","id":"cw1sy","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809401,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50974-87f5aaf8-9918-4ace-a611-21c22a3c3911-1566236778"}

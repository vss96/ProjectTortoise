{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ufsk","stickied":false,"body":"Discussion of subjective and objective is fruitless. Subjective means within one's mind, personal. Objective means demonstrable by some previously accepted standard. Art is a thing that is evaluated based on experience and intuition and without previously accepted standards. This means that everyone has to (or should) make up his or her own mind about the value or quality of the art. This, in turn, means that the judgement is individual and is made according to \"taste\", but once you accept that there there is such a thing as good and bad art and that art has value for us then \"subjective\" is beside the point because the judgements you make are not whimsical but functions of how well you get the value the art has. We are too neurologically similar to even suggest, as the word \"subjective\" does, that the judgement of this thing we agonize over and spend billions on, however individualized it may be, is intrinsically capricious. The artist puts something in; you take something out. There is value there or there isn't. You either get it or you don't.\r\nTherefore It makes more sense to talk about the nature of the value than how we get to it.","controversiality":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166195136,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuwsz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ufsk","author":"wbannard","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808619,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30519-9e5f9193-67db-4dea-9804-1614836f6370-1566236769"}

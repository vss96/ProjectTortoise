I'd recommend you do some research and try to live in the real world instead of your imagination.\r\n\r\n&gt;I have been called anti semite every time I critized anything israel did so therefore to me there is no difference between israel and jew. Israel is jew, jew is israel. I have been told that countless times by jews and now I believe it.\r\n\r\nThe people who made that conflation were either dishonest or idiots, if you share it you join them in either willful ignorance or stupidity.\r\n\r\n&gt;True. That's why not one democrat has the balls to admit that starving palestenians is immoral.  Not one democrat can even stand up and admit that palestenians are human beings who have the ability to feel pain. You can thank your lobby for that.\r\n\r\nThat is patently false.  Take a look at Clinton's work with the Oslo accords.  Clinton made a lot of amazing progress.  Then Bush picked up the presidency and flushed it all.  \r\n\r\nTake a look at Carter's recent book.  He's a Democrat.  \r\n\r\nThe Dems. are the only party in the U.S. that has made any effort at reconciliation when they held the presidency.  They have been out of power since Bush took the reigns, so it's no surprise that things have gotten worse.\r\n\r\n&gt;Israel is a democracy. If most people didn't agree with what their govt did they would vote them out.\r\n\r\nAs I said, many, not most.  I know a number of Israeli doves, and if you looked at the numbers you would see how ignorant you are in throwing around blanket condemnations.  There are certainly not enough doves, but you are doing nothing to help.  By painting with a broad brush and buying into the rhetoric of the extremists you are empowering the extremists.  Your incendiary anti-Semitism (and saying that it there are good reasons to hate the Jews is certainly anti-Semitism) just empowers the worst elements in Israel.  You are part of the problem, and by embracing extremism you are far more responsible for perpetuating the Palestinian crisis than I.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166462215,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36174-b6b95657-787d-4267-8beb-9538680eda7a-1566236772"}

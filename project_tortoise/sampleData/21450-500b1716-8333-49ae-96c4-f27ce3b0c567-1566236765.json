In some small way I'm glad I can do it, but I'd much rather they'd taught me to touch type instead - of course in those days typing was only taught to secretaries.\r\n\r\nIt's a useless archaic skill - fine if someone wants to learn as a hobby (think glass blowing or suchlike) but it should not be part of a modern childs' education. It's pointless. the only benefit I can see is a degree of hand-eye coordination, but they probably get more of that from playstation these days.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165809445,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21450-500b1716-8333-49ae-96c4-f27ce3b0c567-1566236765"}

{"body":"It's a bit like 2^(-1) = 1/2, taken from the usual definition of exponentiation. 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. 2^(1/2)? How do I write down half a 2 and multiply it?\r\n\r\nThe leap of logic used here is a bit counter-intuitive, but it can be summed up by saying, it's not supposed to make sense, it's supposed to be useful. We can construct our definitions any way we want to, and we choose the ones which let us model the world and get work done.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we take the rule that 2^x * 2^y = 2^(x+y), which we notice from regular integer exponentiation, and define the funny cases like 2^(1/2) in such a way that the rule will continue to apply. So, 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/2 + 1/2) = 2^1 = 2, therefore 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2.\r\n\r\nIn the specific case here, I've forgotten the actual maths many years ago, but reverse engineering what you say, I'm guessing there's a rule that e^ax = cosx + asinx, and that things fall out consistently and usefully if we extend this rule to complex values of a.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't mean that there's supposed to be some way to understand in your head why it has to be like this - it doesn't *have* to be like that, it's just the most useful way of defining it which has been found, so it's used.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_un8w","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166001828,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Cookie","id":"cuofr","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuo0i","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808463,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26645-e7f8a41e-0cbe-4994-b54a-09e734233947-1566236767"}

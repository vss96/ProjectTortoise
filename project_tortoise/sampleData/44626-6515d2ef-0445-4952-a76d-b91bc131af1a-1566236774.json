If you think it is, please try to fit the 1948 arab-israeli war and the 6 day war into your analogy. israel didn't have the same military it did now (though the british helped), and is pretty much surrounded by arabs and water on all sides. it's about the size of new jersey. both wars were initiated by the arabs, not by the israelis. come to think of it, so was the war of attrition (1970), the yom kippur war (1973)...\r\n\r\nwhich country in your example is defending itself? both the israelis and the palestinians have legitimate claims to be the one getting raped. i understand that israel has superior firepower *now*. that doesn't mean they should sit back and take it in the ass every time a suicide bomber goes off in haifa. i'm not saying that israel is innocent; rather, they show an incredible lack of tact. please don't pretend however that the arabs are innocent themselves.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vija","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809162,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"carpeliam","id":"cvp7q","parent_id":"t1_cvoku","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44626-6515d2ef-0445-4952-a76d-b91bc131af1a-1566236774"}

I want to say a word about \"freedom\" to all the wingnuts both public and private who constantly spout about protecting our freedoms from the \"terrists\". \r\n\r\nYes, we all love freedom here in the US, but freedom is more than just in this case the freedom to ride a bicycle or drive a car. In this case, it's the freedom to do so without putting your life in danger. The fact that i live in a society that LEGALLY allows people to drive and talk on the cellphone is much more worrisome than the fact that maybe someday I might be in building that gets blown up. Imagine if it was legal for your neighbor to shoot guns in his backyard (and i'm talking about crowded suburbia, not some guy on his farm). You would still be free to go out in your own backyard, but would you? We need a government that's going enact legislation that really keeps us safe, even if means hurting corporate profits. \r\n\r\nIn Europe recently the EU voted to mandate that auto makers change their cars over the next tens years so that they reduce injury in case of hitting a pedestrian. Hoods have to  lowered, engine components under the hood have to be something like 100mm minimum from the hood itself, so when your body smashes in the hood, it absorbs some energy first. The car makers were pretty upset about this, but guess what? Tough luck, they have to make the changes. \r\n","ups":36,"score":36,"created_utc":1164995057,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_t8ou","edited":false,"id":"ct94r","author":"sf_engineer","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807500,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1616-81e25628-b659-421b-9370-98eec01766a9-1566236758"}

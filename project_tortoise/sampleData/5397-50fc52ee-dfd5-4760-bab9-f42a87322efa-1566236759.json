Having to sign some register and be tracked just to by some Robitussin?  This is the idiotic direction of the drug war.\r\n\r\nLaw-abiding citizens are scanned and tracked while actual drug dealers just use NAFTA to keep the supplies rolling in.  If you read about Mexico, there are areas where gangs run everything, thus making it rather simple to manufacture whatever they want without interference.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have a partial solution to the U.S. national debt problem:  Legalize, and tax, drugs.  Start with weed, because that isn't going to even have the problem of addiction or overdosing.  (Illegal weed sales only amount to something like $9 billion a year, though, so maybe not spending that much per month on War would also help.)  Maybe set up government-run shops so the gov't has a monopoly on drug sales like they do with alcohol sales in some states.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807655,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_tfhi","edited":false,"id":"cthae","author_flair_text":null,"author":"lemmikins","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5397-50fc52ee-dfd5-4760-bab9-f42a87322efa-1566236759"}

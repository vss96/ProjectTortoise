I like it.  A lot.  However, did anyone see their new reviews on the new Windows Vista?  They're terrible!  In the gallery, they claim to be featuring the new Aero 3-D GUI, but it's not enabled!  They try to \"rant\" on the OS but miss the important stuff like the kernel and the security issues.  They even admit to not trying to find security flaws when security was THE issue on which MS is selling this product.  They focused on (wtf?!) lack of driver support!?!  Everyone knows drivers won't be readily available particularly on a test release.\r\n\r\nOk, enough ranting, point: I'm pissed at the poor quality of Wired this month, too.\r\n\r\n[Review of Vista](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/reviews/0,72295-0.html?tw=wn_technology_9)\r\n\r\n[Vista Gallery](http://blog.wired.com/wiredphotos7/)","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166111797,"ups":1,"score":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28135-0c2d2776-1433-4432-bfd4-e9c114d51a87-1566236768"}

So if push came to shove, I'm not sure Coke could do anything about it.  But also, people *do* associate red and white with Coke, so I don't think Coca-Cola minds all the free advertising that the widespread use of a red &amp; white Santa Claus affords them.  I don't think there's anything acutely moral about that.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vciv","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39638-b723d94a-3ad3-4466-b422-593e2ba79434-1566236773"}

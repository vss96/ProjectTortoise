This isn't a discussion of hardware capabilities at all, it's a discussion of what interesting visual effects can be done cheaply. I am of the opinion that Twilight Princess is a beautiful example of art in gaming. The fact that it manages to look good is due to smart developers using creative effects (budget HDR, post-processing) instead of burning cycles with complex shaders. This brings hope to those disheartened by the dystopian opinion that costs in game development will soon spiral out of control - Twilight Princess is a great example of what beautiful visual effects can be done with few CPU cycles. I really do hope that this catches on, because our hardware is more than good enough to make better games than the ones in the mainstream right now. Both visually and otherwise. TP is a great showcase of good music, nice direction, story and graphics.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53060-d5b4d06b-ab6e-4602-a112-f155d60f11fb-1566236778"}

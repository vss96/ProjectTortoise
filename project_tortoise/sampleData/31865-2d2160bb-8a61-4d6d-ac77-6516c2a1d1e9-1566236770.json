{"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uz8g","body":"Once I posed the following questions to a fellow student who was doing his thesis on cryptography:\r\n\r\n* what do you do if you don't know the filetype you are trying to decrypt? Matching each candidate's headers against the hundreds of common filetypes will add complexity to the task.\r\n\r\n* what would you do if you don't know the filetype, and besides, the file had its headers removed before encryption? (presumably the destination knows how to add the headers back)\r\n\r\n* what if I encrypt my plaintext as a single frame in an hour's long video? Even if you decrypt the video, you might not find the text (encryption plus steganography)\r\n\r\n... and other similar questions. He didn't know what to answer.\r\n\r\nI think cryptographers simplify their problem a bit by always assuming the encrypted file represents plaintext.","controversiality":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1166234130,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cuzlj","parent_id":"t3_uz8g","edited":false,"author":"buo","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808673,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31865-2d2160bb-8a61-4d6d-ac77-6516c2a1d1e9-1566236770"}

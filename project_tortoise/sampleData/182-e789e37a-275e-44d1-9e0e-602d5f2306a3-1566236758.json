BMI was meant to be used as a population statistic, non as a measure of individual fitness. For example, you look to see if people with a large BMI have a higher rate of heart dieases. \r\n\r\nBut, as you said, it has been shown that waist measurements are much more predictive than BMI anyway, so even the population-wide use of BMI is questionable.\r\n\r\nsee http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v25/n5/abs/0801582a.html\r\nhttp://docnews.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/short/3/11/6\r\n\r\nI remember a study (that I can't find) that claimed that BMI's predictive value fell to zero when incorporated into a PCA analysis including waist size - in other words, almost all the information is in the waist size, and BMI is just along for the ride.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"182-e789e37a-275e-44d1-9e0e-602d5f2306a3-1566236758"}

However, there is a place for formal writing, and a place for informal writing.  The internet tends to be the latter.  I like my comments to be understandable, but if I misplace a comma or colon, if I forget to capitalise a word, or accidentally make a typo (usually a result of typing too fast, rather than not knowing the correct spelling) on the internet, in a COMMENT BOX no less, I find it acceptable. \r\nPersonally, I'll save my anal retentive proof-reading abilities for when I submit my next draft of \"The Elements of Style\". \r\n\r\nFurthermore - is this article we are commenting on about misused or nonsensical phrases? No. It's about the bombing of an African region by a European nation that is being under-reported by the media.  wtf, mate.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808850,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cv7wc","id":"cv8yd","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rraaarr","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36368-140f766e-80a9-4f71-a37a-f50317288422-1566236772"}

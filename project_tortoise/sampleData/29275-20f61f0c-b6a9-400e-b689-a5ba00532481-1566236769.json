{"controversiality":1,"body":"\"I didn't mean by this that Java programmers are dumb. I meant that Python programmers are smart\"\r\n\r\nI don't know.  That viewpoint just seems myopic.  What about JRuby developers?  Or Java web application developers / python script writers.  Personally, I dont think the language debate is an interesting one.  The real debate should be about writing software and what will make me the most productive.   Parsing a file in python (more productive).  Writing a reporting tool that interfaces with an Oracle database (more productive with java).\r\n\r\nI dont want to question Paul's wisdom at all (he is a millionaire making other millionaires, I am not), but I think he is off in that article.","link_id":"t3_utqb","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166140048,"ups":3,"score":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"berlinbrown","parent_id":"t1_cuu1g","edited":false,"id":"cuu33","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808568,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29275-20f61f0c-b6a9-400e-b689-a5ba00532481-1566236769"}

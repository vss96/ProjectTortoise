Odds are if you control the ID and a credit card, you either are that person or stole enough of the identity that there's nothing more than can be done.\r\n\r\nVerification may be asking too much for such a system. To be widely accepted it has to be simple and free of hurdles. Adding support for verification, just as an option, could have enough vendors requiring it to make the ID enough of a pain for people to shy away.\r\n\r\nI can see OpenID having a lot of potential, but not without some cleanup. I'd like to see it succeed. But since it requires thinking (unless you have a LiveJournal account, or some other service that adds the code for you) and the average computer user hates thinking, I believe that will really slow its adoption.\r\n\r\nI would hope for an ID that a complete novice could use, without needing to understand anything behind it. That's one of the good things about the ID system formally known as Passport. You don't need to understand that it's linked to a blog, or that you have to change an HTML page, it just works (well, when the MS servers are up at least).\r\n\r\nPerhaps a couple free proxy services to deal with the HTML parsing and the part of the process, and a few tweaks to the protocol could resolve some of these issues. Like I said, I think it's a good idea, it just has a few issues in its way before it could reach its full potential.","created_utc":1166771964,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45092-81d9ba99-9471-4647-810f-c6551603e6ea-1566236774"}

People who choose to have children must temper and monitor their childrens' exposure to the world, even if that includes participating in a 3rd grader's exercise in using the internet.  That parent should be around to explain the questionable material in a PG 13 movie or on billboards or on the internet.  \r\n\r\nAnd, if we were all a little more honest about sex, porn would lose some of that forbidden allure- another problem with some of the examples you pose.  There's the horny 11 yr old who seeks out sexual images and there's the unwilling 8 yr old who finds them accidentally.  Both kids deserve some explanation from responsible adults.","controversiality":0,"ups":4,"score":4,"created_utc":1167325263,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cw9ko","parent_id":"t1_cw9js","edited":false,"author":"liberatedword","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809550,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55132-832fcc1f-bcca-415a-b754-b42746b24b8f-1566236779"}

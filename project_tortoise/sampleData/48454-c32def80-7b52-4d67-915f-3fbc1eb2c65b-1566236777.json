Or that most of the new testament was written hundreds of years after his death, by the Roman Catholic church.\r\n\r\nWhat it boils down to is that Christianity is essentially just Judaism mixed in with a pagan sect. There probably was a Jewish guy called Joshua (or rather Yehoshua) (Jesus is a greek translation) who was a bit of a rebel/freedom fighter (Today, the US would almost certainly call him a terrorist) who's stories have been mixed up (deliberately) with Mithras and other pagan beliefs of the time.\r\n\r\nWhen people celebrate Christmas, it isn't Jesus they're celebrating, it's Mithras, just by another name. 99.9% of Christians are Jewish/Pagan idolators. Something specifically prohibited by the **very first commandment**. Tut tut does that mean you're all going to hell?\r\n\r\nAnyway. Happy solstice/new solar year!\r\n","created_utc":1166967099,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":14,"score":14,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48454-c32def80-7b52-4d67-915f-3fbc1eb2c65b-1566236777"}

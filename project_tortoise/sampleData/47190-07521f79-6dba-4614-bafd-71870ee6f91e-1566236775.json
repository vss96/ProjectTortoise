It looks to me like the feather flutters and turns over a bit on it's way down, which wouldn't happen in a perfect vacuum.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vtyd","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809258,"distinguished":null,"author":"cweaver","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvu2y","id":"cvu9c","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47190-07521f79-6dba-4614-bafd-71870ee6f91e-1566236775"}

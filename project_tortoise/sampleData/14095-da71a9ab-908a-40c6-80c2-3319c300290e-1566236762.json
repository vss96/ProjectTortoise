{"controversiality":0,"body":"Wow, you pay your kids to do this?  When I was 10 I was mowing the lawn, helping with all the laundry, not just mine (washing, hanging out on clothesline, ironing, folding, putting away), taking out the trash, doing the dishes (no dishwasher in my family), shoveling snow, vaccuuming, dusting, general house cleaning, setting the table, and helping to cook dinner.  \r\n\r\nI didn't get paid to do any of this.  They were part of my chores.  If I didn't do them then I couldn't play with my friends, watch tv, play softball, etc.  This was typical of my friends, boys and girls.  We didn't get paid to do what was expected of you.\r\n\r\nWhen I got a bike, I learned how to use it and repair it properly.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally got a car, I was taught how to use it and how to repair it.  It's always great when I go into the garage because they are amazed a girl can know so much about a car.\r\n\r\nNow that I'm married, I make my husband clean the bathroom and take out the trash because they are the only jobs I really despise.  Everything else we do 50/50.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tz4f","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165512709,"author":"berberine","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctzlz","edited":false,"id":"cu032","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808006,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14095-da71a9ab-908a-40c6-80c2-3319c300290e-1566236762"}

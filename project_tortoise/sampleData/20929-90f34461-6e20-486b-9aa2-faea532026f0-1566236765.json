Also, if you downvote on a post on reddit -- unless you are totally oblivious to how reddit works, you know that the more a post is downvoted the more likely it is to be 'hidden' from others who could otherwise read it. Thus my comment about 'squashing the voice' --- My point is this: On reddit, I see *PLENTY* of posts that are entirely respectful, valid -- continually being downvoted to ridiculous scores like -20 *JUST* because the poster was a Christian and the post is a Christian topic. This is hypocricy on the part of the one doing the downmodding, and themselves seeking a voice in the world.","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165790221,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20929-90f34461-6e20-486b-9aa2-faea532026f0-1566236765"}

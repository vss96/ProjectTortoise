O'Reilly is a stooge for trying to stir up controversy over some scripted thing some 8 year old actress says when he agrees (or atleast his guest does) that she can't comprehend what she's even saying. Infact, he shirks saying anything controversial by merely asking questions that lead his guest to respond with what he'd like to say himself but won't out of cowardice.\r\n\r\nIt's not \"abuse\"...that little girl wasn't harmed by words she didn't know the meaning of. Hell, she got paid and received something to put on her resume should she pursue other acting jobs.\r\n\r\nCongrats to the band though, Bill gave them tons of free publicity even though he didn't reveal anything about the origin of the video. Infact, he may have made it worse. People curious about where the video came from learned the truth and created an internet buzz.","controversiality":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165743719,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19918-3508c92f-beff-40d4-b166-b50e5b021907-1566236764"}

Intent doesn't just matter.  It dominates all other factors.\r\n&gt; \"...regardless of intent...\"\r\n\r\nHow can anything like this ever be regardless of intent?  For example, the Law recognizes the difference between Man-Slaughter and 1st degree homicide.  How do they differ?  Intent.  The Law recognizes the difference between reckless-endangerment, and conspiracy.  What is the difference?  Intent.  Nobody in his right mind would say that accidentally putting down the wrong credit-card number and INTENTional identity-theft are equivalent.  What's present in one, but not the other?  Intent.  I think 3 examples is enough to prove the point that, in transgressions, intent matters.\r\n\r\n2nd. The intent was good.\r\nWe don't need to worry about what other kids might say in a similar situation some time in the future.  The adult authorities in that time and place will, hopefully, have brains and thus will use their best judgment rather than mindlessly follow some precedent or rule.  We don't have to worry about his intent in THIS situation because he DID IN FACT turn it in.  \r\n\r\n3rd. The decision was also the responsible and thus correct one.\r\nIf he leaves to get adult authorities, without taking the gun with him, he is leaving it outside the control of known parties for some period of time.  (However much time it takes to find a teacher, and convince him/her to follow him back to the gun, if it's still there.)  Taking it with him eliminates that risk and thus is the correct decision.  \r\n\r\nedit to remove typo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uvo6","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30656-c7304198-f71b-4065-8112-a45f3db2c313-1566236769"}

It has to do with the husbandry of their caretakers. \r\n\r\nThe corporations raising these animals CAUSE the disease, suffering, and pollution by raising TOO many animals in TOO small a space. Then they add to the problem by covering up the animals' illnesses with overmedication. They even grind up the sickly ones who don't make it to slaughter, and feed them to the others. \r\n\r\nThen, lucky us ... we get to eat them on Christmas and in our sandwiches!","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35135-19c995f7-cacb-4a97-b95e-9e0e00b64844-1566236771"}

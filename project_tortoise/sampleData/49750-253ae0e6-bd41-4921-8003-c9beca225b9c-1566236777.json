There are millions of atheists who do not understand that they do not know. In this sense they are like strong theists.\r\n\r\nSo they're not agnostic. I never claimed everyone was. I claimed that the questions are orthogonal.\r\n\r\n&gt; There are also millions of agnostics who don't think the question is human-decidable. In particular, there are a few thousand agnostics who understand that probability is completely invalid with respect to philosophical questions; in effect, the question is 50/50 either way.\r\n\r\nI bet very few actually hold both options equally likely (I'm not talking about mathematical probability here). I'm talking about the fact that humans tend to form opinions even though they have inconclusive evidence.\r\n\r\nAlso, ironically, those who claim that the question can never be answered by humans have no proof either, so in that sense *they* are like strong theists.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49750-253ae0e6-bd41-4921-8003-c9beca225b9c-1566236777"}

Working for Google. And you get 1 day per week to think up your own idea.\r\n\r\nWhen you submit the idea, Sergey shoots it down saying Google has too many products - they aren't going to release it.\r\n\r\nYou know you can make money on it, possibly even sell it back to Google for another million, so you start doing work in secret and you keep any new ideas secret, and group together with a few other like minded people you met at Google.\r\n\r\nSince you're brilliant, rich, and fearless, you really have no loyalty and are willing to quit your job to capitalize on your idea.\r\n\r\nAnyway smart, independant, money-driven people tend to have no permanent loyalty to anyone, and Google has been buying those people up by the truckload.","controversiality":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165428663,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11909-6632e194-332f-4344-a68c-e38bc51457be-1566236761"}

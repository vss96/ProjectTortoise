{"controversiality":0,"body":"Java *seriously needs* not-null variables, and the core APIs rewritten to lock nulls out of everywhere they aren't actually part of the contract. (This *will* break older code. Suck up the pain and do it!) Even better, not null should be the default. You should have to explicitly mark nullable  (1) variables (2) parameters (3) function return types. The compiler should be able to statically require that an assignment from a nullable to a not-nullable only occur in a code branch in which null has been disproven. (something like a = b == null ? default : b).\r\n\r\nThere is no excuse for as relatively typesafe a language as Java tolerating random nulls everywhere.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tdls","subreddit":"programming","score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1165098802,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"JulianMorrison","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_tdls","edited":false,"id":"ctdsj","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807588,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3946-2cf1ff7b-bedb-41ad-ae97-331498925b77-1566236759"}

This might be a chicken-and-egg example, but imagine if Apache had been written in Objective-C. We would have a huge number of people having written Objective-C modules for Apache, etc. But perhaps the main reason Apache was so populare was because it was written in C, which more people knew in the first place.)","retrieved_on":1473809221,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvsaj","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vs9v","author_flair_text":null,"author":"sblinn","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46163-a6515fd7-e8cf-4f54-9ea1-96a5cbd72d7e-1566236775"}

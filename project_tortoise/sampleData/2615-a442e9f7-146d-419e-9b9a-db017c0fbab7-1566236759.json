{"controversiality":0,"body":"The whole article avoided mentioning a contract that the Chinese national oil company, Synopec, signed to develop, and assume 51% ownership in the Yadavaran field. That contract was worth $128B over 25 years and also specifies 150k barrels per day to be exported to China. That contract was signed in 2004 so it's not a new deal. I wonder why it was omitted.","link_id":"t3_t9d4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165023221,"ups":3,"score":3,"author":"borg","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_t9d4","id":"ctax4","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807534,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2615-a442e9f7-146d-419e-9b9a-db017c0fbab7-1566236759"}

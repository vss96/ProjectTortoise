I noticed a 1000 dollar product starting at 1.00. Looking at the \"previous items\", I saw nothing but needlepoint kits and sewing equipment, mostly a few bucks each. The most recent items were all expensive cameras and similar. I sent ebay a request to investigate and they shut the account down--it was indeed hijacked.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the products are mostly the same. More likely, the seller is in the hospital after a heart attack or something.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20911-5d55611a-cfb4-48aa-9091-023c20426134-1566236765"}

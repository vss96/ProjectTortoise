The most misunderstood aspect of JSON is when people miss that it is a subset of JavaScript - JSON doesn't have a Date object for example.\r\n\r\nIf you need a schema/dtd/etc, then you should be using XML which already has those problems solved. JSON is good for when you don't need that stuff.\r\n\r\neval() is a lot cheaper than rolling your own parser in pure JavaScript, despite the overhead involved in switching back in to interpreter mode. That said, I wouldn't personally argue that JSON is good because it's cheap: my advocacy of JSON is based purely on its convenience for representing standard data structures.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w35u","subreddit":"programming","ups":4,"score":4,"created_utc":1167178556,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51992-de3b53e5-81fe-4ebd-8917-acfceb237194-1566236778"}

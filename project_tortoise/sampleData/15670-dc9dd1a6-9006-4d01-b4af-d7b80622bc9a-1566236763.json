That is, instead of being realistic about the difficulty of handling all the corner cases, people will strive in trying to handle the possible error scenarios they foresee as if it was in some way helpful or a goal.\r\n\r\nSometimes it reminds me of \"Cargo Cult\", even though I know it's part of the self-taught nature of the practitioners.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the \"Algol-like\" languages make it too easy/necessary to handle such cases.

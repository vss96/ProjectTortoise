It says Ford was the \"only unelected president in Americaâ€™s history\".\r\n\r\nWhile Dubya has participated in the election *process*, you can't really say he was properly elected by the people who voted.. or the electronic machines that \"voted\" for them.. or the people who tried to vote and were denied.. or those who had their vote thrown away due to a dangling chad..\r\n\r\nMay America one day have a president as respected as Ford, who will be able to repeat Ford's words: \"My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over. Our Constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men.

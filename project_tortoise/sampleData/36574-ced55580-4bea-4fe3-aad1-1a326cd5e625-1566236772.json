I graduated in 2004, too, from a private college, and my total loans were less than $30K, and were at less than 5% interest. The ones that are left are now at 3.25% interest.\r\n\r\nIf you read the advice link, it's clear that this guy is just financially irresponsible. He's paying $90 a month for a cell phone contract. He shouldn't even *have* a cell phone, let alone one that costs twice what a basic plan costs. I wonder how much his cable bill is, and his car payment, and all the other crap that he shouldn't have so he can actually pay down his debts.","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166472066,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cv9d4","parent_id":"t3_v7vw","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Iamthewalrus","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808857,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36574-ced55580-4bea-4fe3-aad1-1a326cd5e625-1566236772"}

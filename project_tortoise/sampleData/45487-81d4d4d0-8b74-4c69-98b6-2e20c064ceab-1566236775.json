Blogs, they say, tend to disinhibit. Maybe so.\"  This guy is really full of it. His perspective is too short. Remember back to the early 90's when blogs were not so common. It was a time when the GOP made the word \"liberal\" a curse word. How about Lee Atwater? Newt Gindrich was flinging vitriol then, and is still at it. I believe that the conservatives thought they had the political debate cornered when they bought up the commercial press and nearly all of the media. Then along comes the Internet and allows everyone's voice to be heard. I bet the Wall Street Journal offices  are redolent with the fragrance  of sour grapes.","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166802409,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vqdn","id":"cvr2x","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Maxcactus","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809199,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45487-81d4d4d0-8b74-4c69-98b6-2e20c064ceab-1566236775"}

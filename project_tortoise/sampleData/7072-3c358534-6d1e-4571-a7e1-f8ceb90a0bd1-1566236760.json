I am in NO way qualified for implementing any of the suggestions you have all stated into a new language, but I was asking out of pure curiosity, and hopefully it might give someone some insight :)\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I would like to see:\r\n\r\n1. Statically typed with type inference.\r\n\r\n2. A simple syntax (not necessarily s-exprs, but something parsable)\r\n\r\n3. A small base specification, with a good documentation of the specification, and a good book to learn the language.\r\n\r\n4.

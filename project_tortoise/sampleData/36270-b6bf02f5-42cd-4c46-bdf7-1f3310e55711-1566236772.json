So I read this more as a compelling essay on a situation that I am unfamiliar with.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part of your comment is that you talk about educating the recipients.  A lot of people talk about educating and screening recipients and adoptive parents, but relatively less talk about the same practices as pertains to the most common manner of becoming a parent?  What is it about adopting/insemination that makes it require such scrutiny and rigor whereas the natural means doesn't?\r\n\r\nTo me, I think adoption/insemination is a wonderful thing because it's something done by people who genuinely want to be a parent and actively raise a child (though some of the motivations may be selfish).  The same can't always be said for pregnancy.\r\n\r\nAnd you additionally make a keen observation that this girl seems to attribute a lot of her tribulations to the (admittedly probably difficult) circumstance of being a donor child.  Perhaps she's doing so a bit much because it's simply such an easy target (of course being a donor child would create issues), but I'd prefer her to consider some of the other things (single motherhood, growing up under welfare) that might have troubled her, things that she can be more pro-active about.","controversiality":0,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166464494,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cv8rj","parent_id":"t1_cv8pj","author":"duketime","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808845,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36270-b6bf02f5-42cd-4c46-bdf7-1f3310e55711-1566236772"}

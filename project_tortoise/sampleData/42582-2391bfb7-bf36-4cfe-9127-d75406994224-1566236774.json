If my little son or daughter said that in school and the other kids heard it, it would be far more humiliation to them than the fight itself.\r\n\r\nHere's what the little girl should have done. She should have taken her Cabbage Patch pair of skates and slung them across the bully's head. I mean, how funny and humiliating is that??!?! So what is he to do? Hit her back with the same skates and look even stupider? The kid goes to school with stitches in his head and when the other kids come up, they'll say, \"Are you the one who got hit in the head with a pair of Cabbage Patch skates? Ha ha ha ha.\" Now that's justice.","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1166675954,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvl4g","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vjjh","author":"supermike","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809083,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42582-2391bfb7-bf36-4cfe-9127-d75406994224-1566236774"}

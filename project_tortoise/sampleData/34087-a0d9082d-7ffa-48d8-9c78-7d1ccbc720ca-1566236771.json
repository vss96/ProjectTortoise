The initial ripple patterns are definitely standing waves, but the thing to remember is the wave pattern changes as soon as the system receives a puff of air. My guess is that the puff imposes an initial boundary condition that forces the system into a certain wave pattern, and this wave pattern is stable because of the peculiar composition of the liquid. Perhaps the fingers arise from semi-stable states that grow and decay chaotically.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34087-a0d9082d-7ffa-48d8-9c78-7d1ccbc720ca-1566236771"}

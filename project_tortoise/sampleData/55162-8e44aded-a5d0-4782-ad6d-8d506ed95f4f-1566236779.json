It's just incredibly narrow - you have to write the circumventing technology yourself, and you're not allowed to distribute it.  DeCSS was distributed and that's what got DVDJon in trouble.\r\n\r\nHere, I think this guy has a pretty good DMCA case because he hasn't distributed the circumvention.  The AACs people will no doubt try to lean on him, but I don't think they'd have grounds for a criminal case.\r\n\r\nI can't wait for a hardware player to be cracked, which is when the consortium has to make the fun choice of whether to revoke the key (and piss off the customers who bought it) or just deal with the piracy that ensues.  Note that a hardware crack would, even if the key was revoked, provide an attack for copying any AACS-encrypted disc made previous to the revocation :)","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w7jr","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167326603,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":2,"score":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55162-8e44aded-a5d0-4782-ad6d-8d506ed95f4f-1566236779"}

I think python is a little less OO than Ruby/Smalltalk in that it would be considered more pythonic to write a function to do those things. By the way, flatten can be found in the [goopy](http://goog-goopy.sourceforge.net/) code-base, or you could roll your own (it's 7 lines). I dunno what a sorted dictionary is, but same deal.\r\n\r\n2. Um, if you look at http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html chapters 2 and 3 list all of the built-in stuff in python. A method or two may not be there, but if it's not, you probably shouldn't use it. If you want to know all the methods of an object, just poke it with dir(object) in the REPL.\r\n\r\n3. If you're too lazy to do any of the stuff in 2, go to the command line and run pydoc -p 8000. Now open http://localhost:8000/ . Under \"Built-in Modules\" click on \"\\_\\_builtin\\_\\_\".  There you go.\r\n\r\nEdit: Beaten!","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tif6","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6482-15b650ac-9780-4dfd-bee5-793f4dc76bb7-1566236760"}

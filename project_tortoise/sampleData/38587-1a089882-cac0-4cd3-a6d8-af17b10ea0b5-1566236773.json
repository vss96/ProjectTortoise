I did not intend to (directly, at least) say that \"serious mistakes\" have occurred in language design with many mainstream languages in this decade.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'll give a few specific examples of what I was thinking.  :)  Perl 6, for example, doesn't seem so sensible.  I love, in 2006, the language they _appear_ to be trying to create.  However, I believe that the improvements they are trying to create have strong potential to take so long to complete that they'll be out of date or off the mark by the time the Perl 6 team is done.  I estimate completion of a non-alpha/beta Perl 6 around 2011 at their current rate.  :(\r\n\r\nJava has become COBOL.  I won't elaborate -- many people have made that point much better than I; Google for them.  :)\r\n\r\nFuture language improvements to Ruby appear to be dead in the water because of stagnation with its implementation.","ups":0,"score":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166546954,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38587-1a089882-cac0-4cd3-a6d8-af17b10ea0b5-1566236773"}

{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vxit","controversiality":0,"body":"See, the character of Friday is an example of the mostly positive female Heinlein stereotype -- a capable, skilled and intelligent woman *who also likes to have sex lots and lots and lots, with lots of people, all the time*.  And usually also babies.\r\n\r\nThe capable, skilled and capable part is all very well, and I think Heinlein genuinely *liked* these heroines and wanted to portray them positively (which is why I don't agree with people who demonise him as an awful misogynist) -- but the way that they are often driven by a desire to have lots of sex (and/or babies), and all have exactly the same attitudes towards human relationships, is problematic.\r\n\r\n*Friday* is also a book in which the protagonist is gang-raped (gruesomely; severed body parts are involved) by some criminals, is completely unaffected by said rape because of her secret agent sex conditioning, and later meets up with one of her (reluctant) co-rapists and they become friends and lovers.\r\n\r\nAll of which I can maybe buy within the context of the science-fictional world being presented (if such conditioning really existed and was plausible, it's not such a horrifying or unlikely scenario) -- but if you look at it as some kind of social commentary on the real world, it's really creepy.  I have seen *Friday* given as an example of Heinlein's alleged misogynism because of this incident specifically.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1167089371,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvzqi","id":"cw0g7","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"confluence","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809375,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50255-b62aea39-fd49-4a8e-b579-8b6f0dab4de4-1566236778"}

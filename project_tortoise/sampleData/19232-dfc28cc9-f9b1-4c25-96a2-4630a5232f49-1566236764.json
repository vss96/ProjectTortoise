The people of Iraq had been suffering under the sanctions and low intensity continuation of the first gulf war. Let them all starve to death and trust Saddam and his sons, that's quite a policy Krugman.\"\r\n\r\nYou state that the war was a success because it removed Saddam from power.\r\n\r\nAgreed, the war was successful in removing Saddam from power.  But this is only one of the objectives of the war, and those people that Krugman sites never doubted that this objective would be achieved, so I don't see why you are pointing this out.  I suspect that you are pointing this out because all of the other objectives of the war haven't been achieved.  And mind you, this is me stooping to the level of rationalizing \"objectives\" of the war.\r\n\r\nNever mind the injustice of the war, and whether or not the war was necessary, we won't even address those questions.  You talk about the suffering of the Iraqi people.  Please do not act as if a single American gives two wooden nickels about the suffering of people in remote regions, to the point of committing military resources to alleviate their pain.  Only the blind and the dumb would engage in that argument.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19232-dfc28cc9-f9b1-4c25-96a2-4630a5232f49-1566236764"}

Much more sensible to fix what we have - which can work, if done slightly differently (please refer to my comments regarding my primary school - Evergreen).  I take great issue with your assertion that \"preventing your kids from having contact with these people in school isn't going to solve anything; it will just leave them unable to deal with them later in life.\"  I didn't have contact with much in the way of assholic-ness until high-school - but I am a fully functioning adult.  When I run into assholes, I know what to do (not going to cite examples - all depends on the situation).  Getting beaten down by life doesn't make you more able to deal with bad shit - it makes you less able.  The more love you experience early in life, the better off you'll be later on.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809085,"gilded":0,"id":"cvl5x","parent_id":"t1_cuw0q","edited":false,"author":"molasses","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42598-dc4d0e4c-a930-45e1-9ca2-667cdf4dab3a-1566236774"}

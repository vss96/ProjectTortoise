{"link_id":"t3_vuk7","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","controversiality":0,"body":"The problem is, if you looked at the people in this story, these aren't people going \"OMG, FREE MONEY!\"\r\n\r\nThese are people with low incomes who only have two options; Pay the bills by using high interest payday loan places or don't pay the bills and face huge fees. \r\n\r\nTry going to most major banks and getting a better interest rate loan for such a short term. By the time the paperwork has gone through, you are already screwed. \r\n\r\nFor those of us irresponsible middle class people, we can repay the payday loans with no problem. However the people discussed in this article cannot, hence having to pay almost as much in interest as they borrowed in the first place. \r\n\r\nI can't complain about having to pay for my own inability to save for emergencies, but for these people there is often no way they can save for emergencies, as they simply have enough to survive from paycheck to paycheck when life is going well. Thus, in areas where the average income is on the lower side it is almost criminal that these places take advantage of people. When banks, such as the one mentioned in the article, step up and offer better micro-loan solutions, then you can harass the stupid people who still take payday loans. \r\n\r\nUntil then, I would like to see better regulation of these businesses.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166895799,"score":15,"ups":15,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cvuvi","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvuo4","author_flair_text":null,"author":"wanderinggypsy","retrieved_on":1473809270,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47481-a1395d83-25d2-405b-ac51-2de656534d5e-1566236775"}

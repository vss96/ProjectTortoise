{"controversiality":0,"body":"I have no interest in defending everything McKinney has said and done, but I do encourage anyone remotely interested in the democratic process in this country to watch the film \"American Blackout\". Before seeing the film, my impression of McKinney was that of an opportunistic nutjob; watching her in the film, I saw the incredibly rare sight of a congressperson actually doing her job, unafraid to speak out against this administration and question the b.s. being pumped out by a complicit media machine. And as the Democrats take over congress, we'll see, in contrast, the much more common case of Democrats fumbling around, too afraid of political injury to accomplish anything meaningful. There will be lots of talk about the war in Iraq, while the myriad other despicable actions taken by our government fade from the public mind for good.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u7t5","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165685287,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"monkeySpibb","edited":false,"id":"cu8zh","parent_id":"t3_u7t5","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808172,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18645-d554c22b-fbd7-4348-85d4-5e27d4e65c47-1566236764"}

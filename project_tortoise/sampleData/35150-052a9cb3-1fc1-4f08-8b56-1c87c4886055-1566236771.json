I have been around long enough to know that 1/2 of the \"killer apps\" were not apps for the Macintosh.  \r\n\r\n5% of sales have historically gone to Mac.  I think this pretty much precludes the concept of \"killer app\".. A killer app, BY DEFINIION, is an app that drives the sale of hardware.  It is something that people just can't do without.  It makes them go buy the hardware, so they can run the KILLER APP software.  \r\n\r\nAnd 5%, even if every single sale was due to an application, doesn't make it a killer app.  \r\n\r\nPeter Coffee's favorite apps.. Sure.  Killer apps.. no way.","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35150-052a9cb3-1fc1-4f08-8b56-1c87c4886055-1566236771"}

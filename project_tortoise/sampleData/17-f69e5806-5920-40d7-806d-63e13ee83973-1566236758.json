I've never been detained or hassled by a store for shoplifiting. I don't mind showing a receipt to a dude when I walk out of a store like Best Buy that has lots of expensive, easily concealable items to protect. I've had to go through this painful, 10-second receipt-showing procedure maybe 10 times in my life, tops.\r\n\r\nThat's how things work in a communal society where people have to get along with each other ... not everything has to be a libertarian axe to grind.\r\n\r\nMaybe if I'd been seriously hassled many times, I would feel differently, but it's never happend, so I don't.\r\n\r\nNote to cranky libertarians who insist on exercising this right to not show a receipt: You are being a pain in the ass. And a store is a private business. So if everyone starts exercising this right, Best Buy will just have a checkbox contract we'll all have to initial on entering for the first time, to agree that we can be searched on the way out. And we'll all be worse off.","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"17-f69e5806-5920-40d7-806d-63e13ee83973-1566236758"}

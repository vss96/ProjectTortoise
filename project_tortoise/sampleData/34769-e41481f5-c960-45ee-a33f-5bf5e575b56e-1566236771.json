Israel is the home of the jews and the center of judaism. Any jew born anywhere in the world has the right to go to palestine, kick out some residents and build a settlement.\r\n\r\nFactually false.  The Law of Return entitles any Jew anywhere to citizenship, but does not promise them any amount of land from current Israeli holdings or any new settlement.\r\n\r\n&gt;Israel was founded on the belief that god of the jews promised them that land.\r\n\r\nAgain, wrong.  Israel was founded by secularists on the belief that if Jews did not found a Jewish state to protect themselves, they would be wiped out by the combined forces of anti-Semitism and assimilation.\r\n\r\n&gt;Israel is judaism. It's the embodiment of judaism. It's the fulfillment of gods promise to jews.\r\n\r\nStill hideously wrong.  God has yet to send any Messiah, who is supposed to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem and reign as King from the bloodline of David *when he finally gets here*.\r\n\r\n&gt;There is no better way to judge judaism then by judging the actions israel. Jews all over the world support and cheer israel at every turn.\r\n\r\nJews all over the world put up with Israel's atrocities because we have no other state to call our own.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34769-e41481f5-c960-45ee-a33f-5bf5e575b56e-1566236771"}

You mean to imply that the War on Drugs IS applied in an equitable and well-intentioned way and that the wealthy just simply have the means to defende themselves better.  So what about our not-so-pretty Tawny?  Did she have a fantastic lawyer?  You watch too much TV.\r\n\r\nb)  So one must have connections in order to afford justice?  I know you don't believe this, by the way.\r\n\r\nc)  I believe society does care if a poor kid goes to jail because of being caught with drugs in a socially destitute nation where the individual has essentially no political and social expression.  You're just being cynical and this position exposes that you in fact detest everyday people.  Am I wrong?\r\n\r\nBut all-in-all I see what you're trying to say.  You're trying to establish why the outcome of the War on Drugs is as it is, while at the same time discouraging any movement against it.  \"Things simply are as they seem\"...says you.\r\n\r\nMy position comes out of the fundamental assertion that the government and the power it represents is and has been in the business of securing its position in any way it can, and that the War on Drugs is just one of the ways it does so. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about that?

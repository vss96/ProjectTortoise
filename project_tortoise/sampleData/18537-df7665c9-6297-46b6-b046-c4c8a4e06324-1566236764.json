The only situation where you are allowed to take over on the right is when all lanes are about the same speed anyway. In Germany it's always overtaking on the left lane and if more than two lanes trucks aren't allowed on the lanes left from there (3 lanes means 2 rightmost are ok for trucks - leftmost is not). There also aren't any left exits. Highway exits are always on the right side of the highway. In general i think it's a pretty good solution.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18537-df7665c9-6297-46b6-b046-c4c8a4e06324-1566236764"}

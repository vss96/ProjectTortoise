{"body":"What is the line between \"large\" and \"small\" randomness? Isn't any random process really brute force? If I'm not brute forcing a problem, I must have some sort of plan, which means I must have some sort of intelligence, or some goal in mind. Or perhaps I am blindly following rules and processes inherint in me, but that too is different than a brute for attack. And how did those processing rules get there?\r\n\r\n(While I keep using the words \"intelligence\" and \"intelligent\", I want to make it clear I am not a proponent of Intelligent Design theory)","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vx5n","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166981347,"score":-8,"ups":-8,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"temp001","edited":false,"id":"cvxdr","parent_id":"t1_cvxd0","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809318,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48671-d5415bf9-861d-4412-8bb1-ad0e9158cd50-1566236777"}

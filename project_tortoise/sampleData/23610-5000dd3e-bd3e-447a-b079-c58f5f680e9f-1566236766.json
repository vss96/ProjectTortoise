It's just a word used to describe any economy in which money exists and is used to make measuring the flow of resources easier.  Meanwhile, it looks like you think corporatism and capitalism are strictly synonymous.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that a true free market capitalistic economy wouldn't have public corporations at all, because these corporations are legal entities created by governmental interference in the economy.

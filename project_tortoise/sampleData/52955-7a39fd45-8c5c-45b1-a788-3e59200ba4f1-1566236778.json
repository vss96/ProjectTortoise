He then fails to add any evidence of its truth:\r\n\r\n&gt; And, I've seen so many instances of such stimuli winding people up in ways that result in human wreckage.\r\n\r\nWhich, if true, makes his argument valid. If our ability to treat ourselves as the lead in a movie is causing \"human wreckage\", then it's something we should take seriously.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, it's 99.999% harmless, as I suspect, then why is it such a problem? He claims that it is a problem because it's not \"real\", but provides no real backing for that point either, and I think that's a much tougher point to argue.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52955-7a39fd45-8c5c-45b1-a788-3e59200ba4f1-1566236778"}

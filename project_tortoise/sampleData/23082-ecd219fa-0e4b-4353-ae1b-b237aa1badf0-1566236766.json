If you attack someone, fail to kill/injure them, and they defend themselves, you can't just turn tail and run and expect them to be unable to shoot back. The criminal fleeing the attack he instigated is no grounds for a murder change against the defender.\r\n\r\nI'm no expert but I do think that's different from how things work here.  As far as I know you have to be in fear of being assaulted etc before you can attack an intruder in the UK.  In this case Martin's defence was that he had been burgled numerous times before and was at the end of his tether, so to speak.  That still wasn't enough to save him from a manslaughter conviction in the end although as you can imagine, the case aroused huge public interest and a lot of people thought he should never have been charged.  Even Charlton Heston put in a good word for him!\r\n\r\nAs you say, Martin was fairly old and presumably petrified of being burgled again but the case still came down to the fact that he shot the guy in the back while he was escaping.  I think UK law looks at that and says you can't kill someone on the presumption that he might come back and burgle you again in future.\r\n\r\nI've heard some people say that if you do kill or seriously injure an intruder, a sympathetic policeman will tell you what to say when the case comes to court to make sure you're acquitted.  From what you say, it sounds like such a case wouldn't even *get* to court in the US.\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165868054,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuh6v","parent_id":"t1_cucsd","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"muttleee","retrieved_on":1473808327,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23082-ecd219fa-0e4b-4353-ae1b-b237aa1badf0-1566236766"}

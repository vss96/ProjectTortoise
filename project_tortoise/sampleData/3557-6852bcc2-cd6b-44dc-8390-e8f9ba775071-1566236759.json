Casting normally is treated as a type conversion and will either convert the value to the new type or tell you that it's unsupported.\r\n\r\nCasting a pointer, on the other hand, does not change the memory pointed to, it only changes the way the pointer is interpreted. Since a pointer is just a pointer, it's not even guaranteed that you're actually pointing to any value at all or that that value isn't also pointed to by other variables, so it wouldn't make sense to try to modify it.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t9zb","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807575,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"cecilkorik","edited":false,"id":"ctd46","parent_id":"t1_ctcda","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3557-6852bcc2-cd6b-44dc-8390-e8f9ba775071-1566236759"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"\"The high risk-factor obtained is a product not of the fact that so many marijuana users use cocaine but that so many cocaine users used marijuana previously. \"\r\nUhhh...isn't that basically the same thing? 98.8 percent of cocaine users used marijuana before cocaine, and as such that is stong evidence for being a gateway regardless of what % of MJ smokers then turned to cocaine. And even still, 17% moving to cocaine is still quite a lot of people. Speaking from personal experience, I was about 500 times more likely to try cocaine after I had had my first high from MJ than before when I had not been high. Luckily I did not, but I thought about it many times.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tsik","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-7,"ups":-7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165388003,"author":"madmax_br5","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctsxl","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tsik","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807872,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10950-6650939c-6689-498a-b06d-712ebfb82efe-1566236761"}

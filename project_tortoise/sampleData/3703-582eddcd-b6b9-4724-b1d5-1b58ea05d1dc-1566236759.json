So, for instance, to switch from laundry to dishes, she puts down the laundry and walks to the kitchen sink. With a tiny monitor, the best we can offer her is some crude approximation of this, be it a task bar or a command key.\r\n\r\nNotifications are a problem, too. Tilly can receive auditory and even visual notifications in real life because they come from *different* objects. Imagine how annoying it would be if the whistle came not from the tea kettle, but from whatever object she was currently holding. That's basically what happens when you have a graphical or auditory reminder from the computer. It comes on one screen, from one set of speakers, and you can't tell immediately whether the message is related to your current task, or another one.\r\n\r\nI think we need to put our efforts into better, more multiplied hardware. Everyone should have, like, 5 touch sensitive monitors, and they should be in very separate places for different purposes.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165090761,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3703-582eddcd-b6b9-4724-b1d5-1b58ea05d1dc-1566236759"}

Although I don't condone the practice discused in the article, dogs will eat anything. It is in their nature.\r\n\r\nI live in the country where we get our share of rodents and other wild animals. Once in a while we get something that's been dead for awhile (in the yard). The rotten carcass does not deter the dogs - they chomp down. Even if the carcass is buried they dig it up and eat it.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w64z","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809490,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"global360","id":"cw6f4","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w64z","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53514-2ff14855-975b-4b20-8457-2580ddcd2b21-1566236778"}

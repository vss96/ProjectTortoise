Of course if the US continues to run heavy budget deficits the dollar will fall. And yes (to respond to borg) - over the last 3.75 years the USD has lost ground against the CAD.\r\n\r\nThese changes do not occur in a vacuum. As the dollar gets weaker, American goods get cheaper - likewise Canadian, European, and Chinese goods get more expensive. Markets are naturally self-correcting.\r\n\r\nMy statement of 'neuatral situation' was with regard to China selling its bonds on the open market. That does not fundamentally change anything. Moreover, the Fed can simply issue higher interest bonds to counteract any sell-off - which will entice the players involved to buy the new issues.\r\n\r\nI am not forcasting a rosy situation for the USD - I'm simply saying that the hysterical tone often found in these threads (which neither you nor borg is guilty of) is little more than Chicken Little claiming the sky is falling.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807456,"gilded":0,"id":"ct6qb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct6m1","author":"econo","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"488-ad518817-a075-494c-a990-8edde1ac73fb-1566236758"}

Obviously one major problem is that a lot of purported examples of devs stealing ideas are surrounded in controversy, so it's hard to say with 100% confidence as to what the case is.\r\n\r\nAnd the typical ways to protect your ideas are to not tell them to anybody you don't trust, or to get everyone you tell the idea to to sign an NDA.  The latter is really hard.  Venture Capital firms aren't willing to sign them most the time, and if you're a startup you usually don't have the resources to pursue the legal action that's necessary to give an NDA teeth (Microsoft was involved in a case like that.  They basically talked to this small tech company about collaborating or licensing the smaller company's content distribution code, and then took their code, blew them off, the company basically collapsed down to it's 2 founders, and they spent like 6 years pursuing lawsuits against MS.  They won in the end, but i don't think that's the way i'd like to pursue success).\r\n\r\nWorking with people you can trust is sort of shitty advice, but there you have it.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v0cp","subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166371302,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33933-7c4face7-3995-4921-912b-b66912b03279-1566236771"}

This bird is extremely smart compared to other animals and parrots i've had. They are very swift learners. I noticed that at young age they start immitating just words, then phrases. Later on if trained, they would associate words/phrases with events. So if every time you feed him you tell him 'I want to eat' will basically makes him repeat that when he's hungry. However, it didn't occur to me to teach him any grammar, and he certainly haven't showed any signs of telepathy.\r\n\r\nI can't prove it, but I think that The Grey African has the ability to do what that parrot did (excluding telepathy ofc), and maybe also a bit more.\r\n\r\nOh btw, they are VERY emotional animals. If you have one, just ignore it for a day and see how it won't take food from your hand the next day. And if you force it to take it, he'd just throw it away.

If it isn't, then you are not doing structured programming.  \r\n\r\nThat's sort of the whole point of structured programming.  Or it was, at the time structured programming was invented; since then, that point has largely been forgotten.\r\n\r\n(I am not arguing against early return, or against the original author's point.  I am only pointing out that there is a side to the argument that he does not apprehend.)\r\n\r\n(Nor is this intended as an argument that everyone should be practicing structured programming as it was originally conceived.)\r\n\r\n","link_id":"t3_u0r5","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14620-de369b4f-00e1-4e59-aaf7-cdd4cc8a9576-1566236762"}

Give me a conservative estimate on the sum of all fraud cases and see if it's less than $100M.  Say, for instance, that this level of fraud is so rare that only 10 people per state commit it.  Well, there's your $100M.  Now ask yourself, if you were the government tracking down theft (through fraud or sales tax, etc.) would you rather hunt for each of the 20,000 people in your state who dodge sales tax, or would you hunt for the 10 people committing fraud?\r\n\r\nI agree with you that most taxation coercive.  However, I *willingly* give the government money to help out people with disabilities, and these (alleged) liars are taking *my money* even though they don't (allegedly) qualify.

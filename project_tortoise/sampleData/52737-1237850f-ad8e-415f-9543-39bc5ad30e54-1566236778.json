It's easy to love something you don't need to get frustrated over more than you want. So there are no libraries for platform-independent printing in Haskell/Lisp/Ruby? People will say \"So? Is that a big deal?\" But in Java it is AAARGH, platform independent printing is a PITA to get to work, and I need it NOW!!!!\r\n\r\nLanguage frustration is related to use, as far as I can see. But not only, because then C should be more hated than it is. I don't understand why it isn't, really. Perhaps because people are afraid to look weak if they admit that they make all the stupid errors you can make in C/C++.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of Klingon programmers out there.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167216122,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52737-1237850f-ad8e-415f-9543-39bc5ad30e54-1566236778"}

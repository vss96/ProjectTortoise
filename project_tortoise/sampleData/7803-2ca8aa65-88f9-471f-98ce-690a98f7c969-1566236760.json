Informing yourself helps, certainly (and I'm glad I read this article so I know to insist on a second EKG if I ever go in with chest pains), but for the health care system to work effectively, we need strategies that don't rely on the patients knowing these things.\r\n\r\nIf you read the comments, you'll see several people, including at least one doctor, say that standard procedure *used* to be to keep people in the hospital for observation for 23 hours after they come in with chest pain that might be a heart attack, but now more and more hospitals are releasing people quickly, and this is because of pressure from insurance companies.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tiu0","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165274035,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7803-2ca8aa65-88f9-471f-98ce-690a98f7c969-1566236760"}

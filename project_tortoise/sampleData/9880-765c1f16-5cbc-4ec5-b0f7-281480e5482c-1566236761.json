You can't cherry pick which episodes offended you and claim their right wingers. And since when have 9/11 conspiracies belong to the left? There are plenty of anti-government crackpots on the right. Atheism isn't part of the left or progressive movement anyway, its a individual belief structure (and the point of that episode is that there's too many -isms in life). \r\n\r\nThe truth is they lampoon everyone.

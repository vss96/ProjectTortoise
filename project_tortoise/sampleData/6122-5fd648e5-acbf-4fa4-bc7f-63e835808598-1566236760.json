It is not a religion, not furthered by argument, conviction or authority, and it is not constant. Nor does it even relate to true spirituality, which is an individualistic concept - not the societal dogma as presented by anti-science bigots. Science is a process. Religion is lack of process.\r\n\r\nUsing religion to suppress science, morality or education is counterproductive to humanity itself. It harms us, our children and endangers our very future.\r\n\r\nIf truth contradicts your belief, perhaps you should be open to revise your convictions rather than try to shrink the world around your own narrow comprehensions.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tgvw","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165215503,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6122-5fd648e5-acbf-4fa4-bc7f-63e835808598-1566236760"}

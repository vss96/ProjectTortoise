{"controversiality":0,"body":"A little remark on the if/then/else thing -- we should be careful to tell people to write their code such that the 'then' and 'else' are lined up. Many people are used to writing:\r\n\r\n    if foo then\r\n        bar\r\n    else\r\n        quux\r\n\r\nwhich isn't good style in Haskell. The key point to indenting Haskell expressions is to indent all the additional parts of the expression on the previous line to the same amount. The 'then' and 'else' syntactically belong to the 'if'. In particular 'else' is not separate from the 'if', and should be indented relative to it.\r\n\r\n    if foo\r\n        then bar\r\n        else quux\r\n\r\nis the usual way to handle that, as is\r\n\r\n    if foo then bar\r\n           else quux\r\n\r\nwhenever foo is sufficiently small. In almost any event, the 'then' and 'else' should either start at the same column, or the entire if-expression should be on one line.\r\n\r\n    if foo then bar else quux\r\n\r\nOther formatting is accepted under a variety of circumstances, but mostly it's just awkward.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ujjo","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1165934510,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"cgibbard","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cujtk","id":"cukmh","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808393,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24797-b6e939d6-089c-4711-9762-d824b5bb387c-1566236767"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Actually, the presence of a lot of getter and setter methods is often a sign that there is no _actual_ encapsulation in the class. If the getters and setters just copy values in and out of the private namespace, that's tantamount to turning those variables public.\r\n\r\nStudents are taught to add them right away because in Java, if you start with a public field and want to turn it private later you can't without changing the interface. Python solves language wart with the property descriptor (as mrevelle points out). The problem is that students, being students, take away the wrong message and think that encapsulation is all about adding a getter and setter for every variable, thus ironically achieving the exact opposite.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_utqb","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166161307,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":12,"ups":12,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jerf","parent_id":"t1_cuuqz","id":"cuv4y","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808588,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29832-5abf2616-78fa-48d4-9684-ec1825a4c928-1566236769"}

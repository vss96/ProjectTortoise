{"controversiality":0,"body":"I once travelled from Pskov to Moscow overnight in the last car of the train (the craziest place to be), and yes 'platzkart'. It's a fun experience, really. Halfway a guy got on, sat down and put a large full bottle of vodka in front of him on the table. He then poured half a glass ... drank it ... poured - drank it ... so on. In Moscow police was at the station to take him over because for the last few hours of the trip he probably harassed every single female in the traincar. I would have preferred sleeping, but the train was swaying from side to side like crazy and ventilation was nonexistent (it was winter outside, but inside it was hot and stuffy, can't imagine what it's like in summer).\r\n\r\nThe incredible spectrum of people you see on such voyage is just amazing. Oh yeah, and I've had diarrhea too on a Russian train ... not fun, not fun at all. The toilet has a seat, yes, but otherwise it's just a hole in the floor. I guess that's why you're not allowed to take a dump at the stations or near towns.","link_id":"t3_vmv3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166771871,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"frukt","parent_id":"t1_cvoil","id":"cvq51","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809181,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45089-cbd2bdaa-cdc6-4bb7-b2b7-20a0cd8a932c-1566236774"}

Under no circumstances should the doctor lie to both parties that they are \"genetically responsible,\" that's grounds for malpractice as far as I'm concerned.  He doesn't have to be the harbinger of morality in their relationship but he is obligated to give truthful information to his patients.\r\n\r\nFrom the comments on the blog:\r\n&gt;Should the husband find out later that he is not the father, can he sue his wife and the doctor for conspiracy to perpetrate a fraud? The cuckolded husband will, after all, have been providing financial support for a child that he might not have otherwise supported.\r\n\r\nYes, he should be able to sue the wife, not the doctor.","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_uxb8","stickied":false,"subreddit":"science","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166200808,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30762-f5bfc2e2-442e-4164-9800-94f4e080f15a-1566236769"}

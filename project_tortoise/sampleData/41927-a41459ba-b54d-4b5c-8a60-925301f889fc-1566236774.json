{"controversiality":1,"body":"Who's playing dumb here? I admit my \"What's with criticizing Israel\" is a goad, so I'll fess up.\r\n\r\nBut I expect you to do the same.\r\n\r\nCriticizing one of the most brutal regimes in the world is not unfair - it's both necessary and democratic.  If Israel receives a large measure of criticism, there must be a reason.  And if that reason is based upon Israel's actions to it's occupied terroritories and it's neighbors, then what of it?  We **should** crticize Israel - vehmenently.\r\n\r\nThose that do not criticize Isreal have another agenda altogether (and we all know what that is).  \r\n\r\nSo to even imply that criticism of Isreal is wrong is to cast a great deal of doubt on the Isreali supporters and their **real** reasons for supporting Israel.","link_id":"t3_vija","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166652728,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"lifeofliberty","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvjts","parent_id":"t1_cvjsz","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809058,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41927-a41459ba-b54d-4b5c-8a60-925301f889fc-1566236774"}

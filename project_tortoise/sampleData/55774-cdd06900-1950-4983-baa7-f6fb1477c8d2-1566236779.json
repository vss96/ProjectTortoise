To achieve this mission, we test, inform, and protect. To maintain our independence and impartiality, CU accepts no outside advertising, no free test samples, and has no agenda other than the interests of consumers. CU supports itself through the sale of our information products and services, individual contributions, and a few noncommercial grants. Consumers Union is governed by a board of 18 directors, who are elected by CU members and meet three times a year. CU's President, James Guest, oversees a staff of more than 450.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.consumerreports.org/cro/aboutus/mission/overview/index.htm","retrieved_on":1473809574,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cwav4","parent_id":"t1_cwauh","author_flair_text":null,"author":"grauenwolf","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55774-cdd06900-1950-4983-baa7-f6fb1477c8d2-1566236779"}

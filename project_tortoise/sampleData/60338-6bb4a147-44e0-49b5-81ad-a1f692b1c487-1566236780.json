They have lots of pictures of chic houses out in the middle of nowhere that don't use much energy for heating and cooling.  They and this guy entirely fail to understand that most of the environmental impact of housing is transportation and infrastructure.  Living in the middle of nowhere is ecologically about the worst thing you can do.  You'll be driving long distances, the sewer and water lines to your lonely place are a big deal, and all the stuff you buy is probably trucked huge distances.  (Well, this guy is apparently living on rain water and using a latrine, but I doubt many are interested in that.)\r\n\r\nIn urban areas most people lived in very ecologically friendly housing 80 years ago: apartment buildings and row homes served by streetcar.  They lived clustered in areas served by rail lines and ships, eliminating the need for trucking.

Why on earth would you start from the position that god exists and then attempt to disprove it? it's a bizarre and very inefficient way of determining the truth about the world.\r\n\r\nQuestions are like searches, to disprove that a grain of sand exists, you would have to search every grain of sand in the world until you had tested every single grain in existence before you could say that the grain you were looking for did not exist. It's a very strange way to search.\r\n\r\nThe atheist position is the reverse. The grain doesn't exist. If then someone finds one which exactly matches the grain you were looking for then whoopee, at least we didn't have to test every single grain in existence. It's a much more efficient search.\r\n\r\nMore than that, the truth should be built on knowledge that is provable. If it's not provable, how could it be the truth? So start from nothing, make no assumptions. If you start with the assumption that god exists then how can you ever know what the truth is? Everything you know would be built upon that assumption, if that assumption falls, so does all of your truth.\r\n","created_utc":1167274148,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54206-9d03ef4b-8b1c-4b26-920a-d4fb31926645-1566236779"}

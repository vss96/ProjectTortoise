For large codebases re-writing is only feasible when you completely characterize the code and have unit tests for all the code's requirements (hidden and apparent). Otherwise you're likely to write something that gets it 90% right and then spend a lot of time and effort adding the other 10%. Also, it's likely that adding that last 10% will make the new code just as ugly as the old code it was supposed to replace.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w55v","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54023-3b73b06f-277f-47f6-a690-bc67e2777f39-1566236779"}

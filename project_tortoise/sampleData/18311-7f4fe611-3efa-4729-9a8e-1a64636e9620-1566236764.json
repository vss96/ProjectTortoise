Quick, distract them with articles demonstrating how evil USA is.\r\n\r\n&gt; A research by Amnesty International said that only 25 countries executed death penalties in 2004, whereas the mast majority of them (97 percent) was conducted in China, Iran, Vietnam and the USA. It brings up the idea that the US administration will not be pleased to know that the USA now stands next to those countries, which it constantly blames for violation of human rights and democratic standards.\r\n\r\nI don't want to tell _Pravda_ -- _Pravda_! -- how to write propaganda, but the above paragraph really should have been above the fold, not at the end of the article.\r\n\r\nI don't support the death penalty, but this article doesn't do critics many favors. It mentions that the first man to be executed after the Supreme Court lifted the moratorium was convicted of hacking his wife to pieces with an axe. Not quite Sacho and Vanzetti. \"No death penalty for those who hack their wives to pieces with axes!\" Umm, hmm, I think even I'd make an exception there.","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473808160,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu8b9","parent_id":"t3_u84r","author_flair_text":null,"author":"watkeys","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18311-7f4fe611-3efa-4729-9a8e-1a64636e9620-1566236764"}

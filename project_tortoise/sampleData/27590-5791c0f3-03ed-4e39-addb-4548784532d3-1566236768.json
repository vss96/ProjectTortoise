I liked him because he was a Republican who seemed to gravitate towards the center of his party.  His increased courting of the evangelix/extreme right after his '00 loss have slowly killed off his image in my head.\r\n\r\nThat said, under this new legislation, who's stopping a person from putting an illegal image as a comment in someone's blog, reporting said blog and having it shut down all in one fell swoop?  I'd understand if this legislation targeted blogs/sites that specifically deal with illegal material, but there are already laws out to take care of that (Millenium Act).\r\n\r\nFuck you Senator McCain, you are not getting us on this slippery slope!","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_upya","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808502,"author":"Eugi","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_upya","id":"cuqkd","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27590-5791c0f3-03ed-4e39-addb-4548784532d3-1566236768"}

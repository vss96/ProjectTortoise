In fact, opposition to communism was what brought it into being. Fascism wanted the economy to serve national interests, but remain in private hands. Communism called for the abolition of at private property (or at least of the means of production).\r\n\r\nSecondly, as I've noted elsewhere, fascism was supportive of traditional hierarchical institutions, such as the church, large corporations, non-revolutionary labor unions, hereditary military officer castes, and the remnants of feudalism.

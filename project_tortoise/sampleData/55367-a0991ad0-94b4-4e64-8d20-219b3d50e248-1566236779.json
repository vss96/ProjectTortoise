My understanding (which may well be wrong) was that somebody else is writing a book, and its subject matter includes Ford.\r\n\r\nI am \"reading between the lines\" that some people collected this interview with Ford, and agreed to withhold publication (in book form or otherwise) of his comments until after his death.  This is simply what the article seems to say to me.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you are reading between the lines that Ford was doing the book and it will never be finished, and that publishing his comments now is \"Plan B\".  Can you support this?  Where does the article \"clearly\" say this?\r\n\r\nedit: missed a word","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167334409,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55367-a0991ad0-94b4-4e64-8d20-219b3d50e248-1566236779"}

They need to realize that bullshit like killing civilians simply makes it easier for King George to pull off bullshit like invading Iraq.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck is wrong with some people?  \r\n\r\nYou know, before 9/11 I wasn't particularly vehement in disliking 'terrorists'.  Terrorist is simply a label applied by one side to paint the other to raise nationalistic support.  Anyone is a terrorist, depending upon your perspective.  If muslim radicals felt shit upon by US policy, I couldn't outright disagree...looking at the ball-cradling the US gives Israel compared to the rest of the region...especially when the US looks the other way while Israel pulls some batshit insane stunts (I'd probably be batshit insane if I lived there too).\r\n\r\nI dunno.  The Saudi government is shit.  Most of the leaders in the region are just as batshit evil and insane as your typical African nation, just with more money.  This is the way things have always been.  Its just that now the US is sticking its nose deep into a festering pile of shit that has been simmering for a very long time.  \r\n\r\nI guess we really needed a new cold war that badly to continue to justify the MIC suckling from this nations teat?\r\n","link_id":"t3_umb0","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36788-cdd1299e-9d24-4b1b-b800-4929a185a4e7-1566236772"}

If there are lots of intersections or blind curves, my speed is dropping.  I've had too many close encounters with farm equipment pulling out in front of me, or coming around a bend into the face of oncoming traffic 3 abreast (a car passing a car passing a car).  If people behind me get pissed off, fine.  They can be pissed off at me when I save their life too.\r\n\r\nIn my 20s I logged an awful lot of time above 100 mph, but I never tailgated (inefficient, makes it difficult to pass quickly) and I never sped through someone's neighborhood.  Now that I'm older and often driving with my kid, I think more deeply about safety issues.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52528-93fe333d-df9f-42c4-8dc9-3d9beee4ea15-1566236778"}

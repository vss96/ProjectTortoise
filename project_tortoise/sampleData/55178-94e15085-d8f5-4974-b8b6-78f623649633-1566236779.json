I translated the VB one to java in one day.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I introduced some bugs in the process, but yeah, it'd be nice if there were a lingua franca.  Python has a great interop story, but then you hear (and feel) the idiomatic impedance.\r\n\r\nThere's no one right answer, and design -is- about compromise, and it's all one babel'ing shit sandwich.  But until I get the head jack with the 30 second download of my choice of J2EE, SICP, or SOAP, well, I'll stick with the tools I've already spent years learning.  And maybe pick up a few that look especially useful.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1167327454,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55178-94e15085-d8f5-4974-b8b6-78f623649633-1566236779"}

Did he even take into consideration that once you start moderating you are no longer a \"service provider\" and are then responsible for anything ever posted on your site including copyright violations, libel, etc?  Many forum owners don't moderate anything unless ordered to through the legal system as it opens them up to being sued personally for what someone else posts.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vvnu","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166921953,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"47980-8a2904c2-12b1-4bdb-94f0-18313f6b8a18-1566236777"}

If you whack it with a hammer, you can still claim innocence and that \"you don't know how it possibly could have happened.\" \r\n\r\nI got INS to write a special letter for me because they took my passport for 6 months in the late 90s (my husband is british and some stupid rule said they needed my passport for some crap) and they put two holes in the top of it so they could attach it to the file.  That's tampering/altering.  Luckily, a year later, when I flew to the Netherlands, upon re-entering the USA, I had that letter with me.  If not, the customs agent was going to slap a fine on me and confiscate my passport.\r\n\r\nI tried writing my congress critters but they never replied over the whole rfid matter.  Thankfully, for now, I don't have to worry because my passport expires in 2013 and there's nothing in it yet.  However, I am going to pick up one of those nifty wallets from Difrwear now and hang onto it until the time comes that I need it.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809462,"gilded":0,"id":"cw51b","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw3ty","author_flair_text":null,"author":"berberine","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52767-3fafe341-32b0-4d65-9999-2e3744843c66-1566236778"}

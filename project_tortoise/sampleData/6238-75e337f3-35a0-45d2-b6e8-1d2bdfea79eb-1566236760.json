The theory was that this is associated with a genetic defect that both causes a set of neurological defects, but also speeds neural impulses. You can search the New York Times archive for the article.\r\n\r\nAlso, *average* IQ and *high* IQ are related. For example,\r\n2.5% of the population has an IQ two sigma (130) above average, but only 0.15% of the population has an IQ 3 sigma (145) above average. So if one population has an average IQ just a fraction of sigma more than another population, the number of people with a \"high\" IQ will be much greater in the first population, simply from the rapid fall-off of the Guassian tail. In other words, if you boost a population's mean IQ by 15 points, then the number of \"geniuses\" with an IQ over 145 will go up from 0.15% to 2.5%, more than an order of magnitude.","retrieved_on":1473807690,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctgo7","edited":false,"id":"ctj4e","author":"anonymous-coward","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6238-75e337f3-35a0-45d2-b6e8-1d2bdfea79eb-1566236760"}

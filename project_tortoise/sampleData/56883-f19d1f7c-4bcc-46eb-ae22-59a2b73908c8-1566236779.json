{"body":"I've never tried this; heck, I've never used \"metrics\" to any significant degree.\r\n\r\nBut I get the sense the only way to use metrics is if you absolutely, positively don't tell anyone, either above or below you in the management hierarchy, that you're doing it. People below you will try to game the metrics, people above you won't understand them. This limits their utility since you can't just walk up to Bob and say \"Your FAKEMETRIC numbers are too low this week\", but it's probably a good thing that you'll have to figure out a better thing to tell him anyhow since it's very unlikely low FAKEMETRIC numbers are actually the underlying problem.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wcfn","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1167408490,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jerf","edited":false,"id":"cwd5l","parent_id":"t3_wcfn","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809616,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56883-f19d1f7c-4bcc-46eb-ae22-59a2b73908c8-1566236779"}

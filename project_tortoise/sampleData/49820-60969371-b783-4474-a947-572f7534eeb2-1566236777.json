Since everyone was afraid of being labeled a communist (e.g. blacklisted) by opposing the addition of \"under God,\" the Knights of Columbus were able to have it added to the pledge without much opposition.  So basically, it was added during a period of fear and terror after a virtual suspension of free speech and remains there today as a relic of the Cold War.  No politician will ever suggest removing it because of the organized opposition they would face from the evangelical community and there is nothing to gain by removing it, politically speaking.","ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167062257,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvyfo","edited":false,"id":"cvzjo","author":"crake","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809359,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49820-60969371-b783-4474-a947-572f7534eeb2-1566236777"}

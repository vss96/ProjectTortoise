{"body":"First this will suck all the fun out marriage.  And second less and less people will be getting married if everyone asks these questions.\r\n\r\nPeople would be better off taking a marriage compatibility test to see how they will relate to their partner in marriage.  This get a counsel to help review what they find and explain to them what the trouble spots might be.  Also this gives them a common ground to resolve difficulties, presumable they both trust this counsel before they got married so they should both trust this person after they get married.\r\n\r\nWhile a some people might object to this, try living together for six months will resolve a fair amount of this \"domestic\" issues they tend to bother people.\r\n\r\nSome of the other questions assume that people are going to stay totally static in their thinking.  Or assume people can really think that far a head for example:\r\n\r\n* Will move if a get a really good job somewhere else?  Oh the answer is no?  What if we *have* move to survive?  Oh the answer is yes?  What happens if you have a sick parent that needs attending too?\r\n\r\n* Issues of religion, what if someone is deeply religious and then stops believing?\r\n\r\nThere is so much of this that is not concrete.\r\n\r\n* Oh you don't want to have children?  Well neither do I, then you change your mind.\r\n\r\nNow some of these are good but it should be titled:\r\n\r\n\"15 things about marriage that might be a concern later, but don't seem relevant when you are about to get married.\"\r\n\r\n","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v8ov","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-4,"ups":-4,"created_utc":1166473905,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cv9jd","parent_id":"t3_v8ov","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808860,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36666-dd33c74e-bafe-4cb4-9767-86047d0eddc0-1566236772"}

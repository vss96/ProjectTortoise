{"link_id":"t3_tvxs","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"No, by staying busy I mean tending to your needs, most importantly keeping your temperature and maintaining and acquiring resources, such as food and water. You can also assume that food and water will be an issue, so this must be done. But it is also largely about morale and staying clear-headed.\r\n\r\nIt's a balance, of course, but you don't by default have the luxury of kicking back and enjoying that half gallon of water in your car, or those powerbars in the glove box, especially if you don't know how long you'll be lost. \r\n\r\nIf you have days or weeks worth of food and water, sure, then it might be a good idea to take it easy for a while. But you need to stay busy to keep a level head anyway, by building (or improving) shelter, fires or signs for rescue ops. Survival is as much mental stress as physical, and mental fatigue will get you in trouble alot faster.\r\n\r\nEspecially in arctic climates, \"minimizing activity\" means wasting calories with no benefit, while ignoring the devastating mental effects that settle in from \"just waiting around\". That's when you might decide it's a great idea to walk over a mountain range to look for help.\r\n\r\nBasically, when under stress and fatigued, you're likely not rational enough to balance calorie intake vs expenditure, so it's easier to remember \"stay busy\". If you are, that's great, and you probably know what to do.\r\n\r\nAn easy to remember rule for outer limits of survival are the \"three threes\". You can go three hours without freezing, three days without water and three weeks without food.\r\nYou need to always prioritize your activities accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf you're seriously lost, you can add a fourth \"three\", and that'd be the number of months until everybody assumes you're gone for good. By then you should either have built a decent house with a farm or walked home.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165483760,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctyhw","parent_id":"t1_ctxpm","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dln","retrieved_on":1473807976,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13459-d1e547ae-e5fc-489b-979e-03c73bb46b64-1566236762"}

How does whitespace not delineate blocks nearly as clearly? You're telling me that you can spot two 12 pixel tall squiggles at the top and bottom of your screen, at the same time, better than you can tell if a block is closer or farther from the edge of the screen?\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that I don't like indentation *as well*, I'm saying that they're not a complete *substitute* for bracing.  Bracing of any kind (even begin-end blocks ala Basic/Pascal/Ruby/etc.) does a good job of marking off blocks of code, and there is absolutely *no* good reason, as far as I can see, to leave it out.  It is an unnecessary shackle.\r\n\r\nIt affects the language, too.  It's part of why lambdas are so royally screwed up in Python.  Maybe it's not the \"Python way\", but I like writing anonymous functions - and being shackled to a single expression *because of the syntax design* (since they apparently didn't want to deal with syntax rules for blocks nested in expressions) seems pretty damn well borked to me.\r\n\r\n&gt; Also I don't understand the part about a code block long enough to go off the screen. Surely it is easier in Python since you don't need to see the top and bottom of the block to determine the level of indentation?\r\n\r\nYou might be able to determine the level of indentation, but you can easily lose track of what code block you're in.  I use the % command in vi to match braces all the time - it's an easy way to navigate code, especially code I'm unfamiliar with.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808367,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cujbh","parent_id":"t1_cuj50","edited":false,"author":"academician","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24244-5a63ae85-5b2b-4527-b482-ea751a20de40-1566236767"}

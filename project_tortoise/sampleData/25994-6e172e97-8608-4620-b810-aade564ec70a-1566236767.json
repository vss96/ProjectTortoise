Of course they also said he was a she, as her shell is slightly concave.  \r\n\r\nMine hasn't grown much if any in the time I've had her, and she went from a 55 gal. tank to a 125 gal.  Of course the new tank is great for her.  She genuinely seems happier in it.\r\n\r\nOf course, I have a 15 inch plecostmus who pickes her up and tosses her around the tank!  But it's a fair fight, as the turtle has a mean bite!","link_id":"t3_uibm","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165968879,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"CaffiendCA","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cum2h","id":"cun2t","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808438,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25994-6e172e97-8608-4620-b810-aade564ec70a-1566236767"}

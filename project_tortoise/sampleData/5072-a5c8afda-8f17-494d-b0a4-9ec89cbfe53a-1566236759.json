Price sends a signal.  The signal in this case is that the Wii is a serious gaming machine.  At $150 it would be entirely dismissed as a toy.\r\n2. You might want to depress demand if supplies are low.  $250 is still a lot of money for most people, and by keeping some shoppers away you avoid the ridiculous eBay runups, fistfights in stores, etc.  [Of course, this isn't always foolproof, as the PS3 launch stories show.  But the PS3 is targeted at an audience (serious gamers willing to pay top dollar for top graphics) with better average cash flow than the Wii (target: everyone).]","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tdyf","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5072-a5c8afda-8f17-494d-b0a4-9ec89cbfe53a-1566236759"}

Where I am it is unusally warm today, but only a fool would go outside without being nearly completely covered.  In fact to save on heating bills I'm typing this is a sweatshirt -  and I'm known as one of those who like things cold.  Yes there are cultural aspects as well, and they play a large part in what we wear.\r\n\r\nI think the main issue is religion: 80% of the US claims to be christian.   Nearly all christian religions reject sex with anyone you are not married with, and encourage modest dress.   (You have to ignore some part of the bible to say otherwise)   The number of people who dress/allow their kids to dress overly (by christian definition) sexy does not match with the numbers who claim to be christian.  \r\n\r\nMy understanding is that when times are bad people tend to seek mates because they are less likely to survive long, so they have to pass their genes on now.   I don't know of any studies on this though.  (I'm sure some exist)\r\n\r\n\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59139-43cda200-6f86-4976-a6f9-2723d9dae67a-1566236780"}

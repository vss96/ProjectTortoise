It is a simple but elegant XOR swap that is no shorter than a temp swap, but doesn't need the extra memory.\r\n\r\nI do know that, but I know perfectly well that most people looking at my code don't. If someone would use such a method for swapping, it would give me a message that he has an inclination to show off his mad ski11z in situations where it doesn't make much sense.\r\n\r\nAbout the bulletproofedness: exactly my point. j-o-h-n's question was more of an assertion that the applicant understands the significance of exceptional situations and wouldn't just lock up when faced with the fact that his cool solution doesn't work in all possible situations.\r\n\r\nedit: grammatical mistake","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16652-89b5dd42-1ec5-4d95-8c31-157d65acc36b-1566236763"}

His instructions to \"go around back\" were for the trucks behind 5 to pass and get out of the \"killzone\" before they too were disabled (another IED, grenades, RPG, etc). \r\n\r\nYou seem to be getting hung up on the convoy leaving the disabled trucks. They couldn't get those trucks to their destination anyways so they'll stay with the operating vehciles and call in a patrol. This is a big part of why KBR drivers are making 150,000+ a year.  What really bugs me is that army drivers doing the same work are making under 35,000.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vgpa","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809051,"author":"thevalarauk","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvjg6","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cviwd","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41689-d3823d72-bc91-4889-a120-3c4560f7c5ee-1566236773"}

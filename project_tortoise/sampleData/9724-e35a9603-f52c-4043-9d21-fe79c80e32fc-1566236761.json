Or 5/8 time? Or dissonance? Or counterpoint? I could go on ...\r\n\r\nYou took music theory, right?  In my Tonal Harmony and Counterpoint course, they were very careful to stress that music starts with a progression from tonic to dominant and back.  We always had to start our harmonies by harmonizing over the tonic only.  Then we would add the dominant where the melody didn't fit a pure drone, and start changing the voicings.  Then we would add subdominants and fully diminished vii7s to spice it up.  Only then could we think about adding iii chords or dissonances, and very judiciously at that.  We had points taken off if we started playing around with iii chords before we'd tried it with just I, IV, V, and ii6.","link_id":"t3_tn3v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9724-e35a9603-f52c-4043-9d21-fe79c80e32fc-1566236761"}

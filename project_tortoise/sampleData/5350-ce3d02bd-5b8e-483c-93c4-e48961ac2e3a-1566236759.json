If juries alone held the power to topple it, one would think that they should have done so already.\r\n\r\nDespite never having been personally arrested for any drug \"offense\", I have nevertheless engaged in drug usage for more than two-thirds of my entire lifetime.  Throughout this period, I have both witnessed and participated in seemingly endless debate upon the topic of drug usage and legality.  This effort on my own part, as well as on the part of many others, has resulted in no real effect; the \"war\" continues to escalate.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the situation shall change at all within the remaining years of my life.  I further believe that it may be most unlikely to change within the lifetimes of my children.  Until America falls, its \"authorities\" shall always strive to maintain the status quo.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165178781,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5350-ce3d02bd-5b8e-483c-93c4-e48961ac2e3a-1566236759"}

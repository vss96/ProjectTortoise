{"body":"Looking back through your comments of the past, I see that your main contention really is not that criticizing Israel is bad, but that the only articles regarding violence that get upmodded to the top are those that are about violence that happens in Israel.  I wonder, now, can we settle this argument?  I am perfectly willing to admit you are right if we can prove it.  I bet the reddit statistics dude would be able to tell us.  Shall we find a way to ask?\r\n\r\nedit: oh, wait, that wasn't you saying that.  That was lennox125.  None the less, this is what you are trying to say, yes?\r\n\r\nI have gone and sent an email to the [statistics dude](http://reddit.com/info/vijt/comments) asking if he/she can settle this (what I am perceiving as this, anyways) argument.\r\n\r\nedit #3 (!!!): Oh, no! I went and did some research and typed it all in - and I guess I took too long - and it didn't post.  ARGH!  Anyways, here's the synopsis:  Browse reddit.  Sort by top, all-time.  In the top 28 articles (which was as far as I got - down to [tanks appear in Bangkok](http://reddit.com/info/j30d/comments) - there was not a single article about violence or political malfeasance that was about Israel.  I have the feeling you are seeing only what you are looking for: anti-semitism.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vija","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166669758,"author":"molasses","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvkv2","parent_id":"t1_cvjt4","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809079,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42425-53fb8156-3699-4154-83e7-2a80a5410519-1566236774"}

While some movies romanticize brilliant teachers who come to an inner city school, suddenly motivate the entire student body who previously only cared about starting fights, smoking weed, and getting pregnant to care about their education, that's just not reality. Only a handful of those kinds of teachers actually exist, regardless of what the job pays.\r\n\r\nKids in my honors courses at my highschool got a great education. And it wasn't because all of the teachers were outstanding. It was because it was a self-selecting group that cared about learning and were easily taught.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808564,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cutt1","id":"cutul","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29152-a850479c-338b-4e4e-b7e5-9eabbc6b55de-1566236769"}

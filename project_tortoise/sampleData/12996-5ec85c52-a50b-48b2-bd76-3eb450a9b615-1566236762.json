The landslide could well be gone -- it was not insurmountable; perhaps it was merely a matter of when Oregon could budget dollars to clear it, fix the road, and secure the rock face from which it originated.\r\n\r\nAnd even if the landslide is still a problem, I may be wrong about its location.  It's been two years, and the google maps photography is not sufficiently clear to be sure of such a feature, particularly given the abundance of tree shadows crossing and obscuring the road.\r\n\r\nMr. Kim and the Kim family sound very resourceful.  My heart goes out to them for this tragic loss.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tvxs","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807956,"distinguished":null,"author":"pasbesoin","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctxfb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctxdx","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12996-5ec85c52-a50b-48b2-bd76-3eb450a9b615-1566236762"}

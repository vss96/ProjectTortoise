I mean that seriously.\r\n\r\nI understand your interpretation of \"though\", but that's not how I read it.  Allow me to rewrite the sentence from the article to illustrate:\r\n\r\n\"The Ford interview ... took place for a future book project, but it's okay for us to write this article before the book is published, because he said his comments could be published at any time after his death.\"\r\n\r\nAs far as the sentence itself goes, the meaning is rather ambiguous.\r\n\r\nedit: I would like to say though, that the simplest explanation here is that Ford simply said that his comments weren't to be made public until after his death, assuming that they'd come out in the book.  Then the journalists decided that it would be okay to release them apart from the book after his death, and so we have this article.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167337862,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cwa9k","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwa7n","author_flair_text":null,"author":"bhagany","retrieved_on":1473809562,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55460-70327395-b83b-4d6b-b60a-81519a1b3266-1566236779"}

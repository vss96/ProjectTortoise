{"body":"As one of these over-educated breeders, ( http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/national/20women.html?ex=1284868800&amp;en=6a8e0c413c09c249&amp;ei=509 ) I have to say, that, outsourcing is probably not the answer.    Thus, we have to find balance and make compromises.  But, balance is only possible if one studies the market and make oneself a competitive product. (See my comment below.)  I work less than part-time as an artist-educator. Once a week for 1/2 a day over five weeks, I make what my husband earns in a month.  If I were able to work full-time -  I'd make the same amount as my husband who has a steady reliable income with a full time job.  However, our family priority is to have me be the primary care-giver 90% of the time.  I have the skill sets, experience and academic background to accomplish the job defined as \"raising intelligent, well adjusted kids.\" (Might I add, I've turned down 3 jobs in the past month in favour of being a mother.)  Other people do not define being fulfilled as \"choosing to limit their own personal heights in favour of a future filled with responsible, happy off-spring contributing to world solutions.\" I pick and I choose.  And I have decided that \"having it all\" means making compromoises and giving up what others would aggressively pursue.   The book, \"The Two Income Trap\" is a great for people who want to evaluate the economics of making these kinds of choices.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w367","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167220801,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"svaha","id":"cw51x","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw4at","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809463,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52777-2f7798fa-3f0b-4317-a2d2-a73af2b8fb5f-1566236778"}

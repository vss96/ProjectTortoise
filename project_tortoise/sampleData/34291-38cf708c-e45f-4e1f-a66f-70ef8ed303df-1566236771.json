I like the article, it describes what has happened with me to a tee. However, I don't think we're watching a shift in power.\r\n\r\nIf anything I think the country is trending socially conservative, economically liberal. Even as the Republicans lost in November you had more Gay Marriage Amendments, civil liberty concerns didn't even show up in exit polls as a reason for the Democratic victory. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, could you imagine cutting expensive social programs? Of course not, the trend will continue to be to seek equality with tax dollars at the expense of personal liberty. Probably not single payer, but government funded guaranteed health care is coming, etc. \r\n\r\nI feel like as a Libertarian I am the opposite of the mainstream American voter.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34291-38cf708c-e45f-4e1f-a66f-70ef8ed303df-1566236771"}

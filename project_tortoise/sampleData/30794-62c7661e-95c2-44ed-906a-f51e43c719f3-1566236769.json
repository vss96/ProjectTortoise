{"controversiality":0,"body":"Hi, this is my site.  And the Reddit submission wasn't my own - someone else submitted it.\r\n\r\nI originally built this site after getting married and having to register for gifts.  I had no time to research cameras and routers and cookware. I just needed to choose quality items, but couldn't find a helpful site to do it.\r\n\r\nCouple that with the fact that I'm a go-to guy for \"will you help me pick out a laptop\", and this site was begging to be created.\r\n\r\nYes, there are Amazon links and Google links.  They came after the site was built.\r\n\r\nFrom the front page:  \"Full disclosure: We get money if you click on any of the sponsored links. It's the same as every site on the Internet. There is no shame in that. This is a free service and we have to pay the server bills somehow!\"\r\n\r\nAnd to be honest, based on the feedback I've been getting, many people love the idea.  I have gotten many requests for more recommendations.  \r\n\r\nSo, take it or leave it.  I don't think it's spam.  I think it's useful and took a lot of time to make the recommendations.  It's a silly site until you have to buy a coffee grinder and have no interest in researching them!\r\n\r\nPS Sorry for the slow server :)\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uw76","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166201471,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":25,"score":25,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"hoist2k","id":"cuxfk","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_uw76","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808630,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30794-62c7661e-95c2-44ed-906a-f51e43c719f3-1566236769"}

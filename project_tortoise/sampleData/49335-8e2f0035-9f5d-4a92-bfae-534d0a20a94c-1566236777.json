The basic motivation of the people in charge may have been politics or greed - but religion is very often the means used to manipulate the *people* who have to finally kill (or die) and perpetrate the attrocity (The foot soldiers). This happens all the time in India, for example - Politicans raise a stink about some minor incident out of the blue, and Hindu-Muslim riots ensue where hundred if not thousands get killed within a couple of \r\ndays. Politics is the motivation. Religion is the means of implementation.\r\n\r\nThis is what I've been trying to drive into that thick skull of yours. Relgion doesn't have to be the motivator. A lust for power or money among a few could easily be that. But how are those desires met ? (Bin Laden didn't blow himself up, for example) .How do they manipulate the masses into getting what they want ? The answer is very often - by using religion.\r\n\r\nThis is totally unlike the WS Racists. (Forget the fact that you're bringing straw men into the argument). The Black persion theory is more like the Coke in my previous joke - when the real problem is poverty and past-oppression (like the alcohol in my joke).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809340,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvyk1","parent_id":"t1_cvyjd","author":"Raoulmeister","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49335-8e2f0035-9f5d-4a92-bfae-534d0a20a94c-1566236777"}

Even when you are writing a JavaScript-intensive application, it still makes sense to split the various sections up into different pages.  That doesn't make it \"page-centric\", you can still take multiple actions on a single page without navigating away from it.  It makes it *view*-centric - something that's a good idea even in traditional desktop applications.\r\n\r\nTo further elaborate on the webmail example; you have a page that lists all your emails.  The HTML contains a drop-down list of folders, you can select emails and click a button to move them to that folder.  Clicking the button posts a form to, say, /move-email, which performs the action and then redirects back to the email list.\r\n\r\nNow, when you implement the Ajax drag and drop, you will use the same page, you will still be posting to the same /move-email, you won't navigate to another page after the emails are moved, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe point is, for the JavaScript user, the degradable and non-degradable approach are *indistinguishable*, so it makes no sense to criticise graceful degradation based on the experiences of the JavaScript users.\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807803,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctp4u","edited":false,"id":"ctp9j","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Bogtha","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9011-cd37edb5-5d55-4e56-b295-c7c1260a610c-1566236760"}

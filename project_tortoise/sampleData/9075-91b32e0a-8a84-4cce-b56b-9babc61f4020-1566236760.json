Some good examples of this right now would be Robert Jordan or George R R Martin.  They already have the name recognition.  This guy however was an unknown and Tor recognized that he (and the book they bought from him) could prove to be more valuable by far in the long term if they made a short term sacrifice to let him build up his audience base.","link_id":"t3_tnlk","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9075-91b32e0a-8a84-4cce-b56b-9babc61f4020-1566236760"}

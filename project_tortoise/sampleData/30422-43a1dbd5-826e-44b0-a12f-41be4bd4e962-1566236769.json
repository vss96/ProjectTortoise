Including drills of hijacked aircraft with fake blips on the FAA's screens.  Operation Northern Vigilance and some other drills pulled nearly every fighter jet in north america to the north pole, greenland, and alaska.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thememoryhole.org/911/cia-simulation.htm\r\n\r\nI know there are a lot of nutty theories around for what happened or didn't happen.  But you have to realize that even the 'official' story is a 'conspiracy theory' about 19 muslims.  You're buying into someone's theory no matter what you believe, and you should at least *read* the 9/11 commission report before deciding that's what you believe.  Personally, I knew that couldn't be the explanation as I watched events unfold on 9/11/01, if only because the NORAD/FAA response was *so* faulty, and the 'evidence' of the official story came out *so* fast, and was *so* convenient.  As time has passed, I've seen a lot of faulty explanations on both sides of the issue, and I really don't know *what* happened, or who is responsible.  I *do* know, however, when I'm being lied to, and the 9/11 commission report is a pack of bald-faced lies and self-contradictions.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uuy7","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166192429,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":10,"ups":10,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30422-43a1dbd5-826e-44b0-a12f-41be4bd4e962-1566236769"}

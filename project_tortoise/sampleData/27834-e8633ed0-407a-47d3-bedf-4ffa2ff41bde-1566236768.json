You intentionally left out a bunch of stuff:\r\n\r\n&gt; And then the strangest thing happened. Nobody helped me. In Muslim society, charity and hospitality are legendary. I have known Egyptians cross four lanes of rush-hour traffic to help with a flat tyre; an Omani minister once gave me his prized walking cane inscribed with his title in silver; Indonesians have slaughtered their sole goat to share with me. And yet here I was, lying in the road, obviously very badly injured, and yet nobody came to help.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n&gt; The only charitable explanation I can think of is that perhaps nobody dared come near me lest they get dragged off to the police station as a witness. \r\n\r\nWhich is probably a concern if the security forces are compromised.\r\n","link_id":"t3_upl4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166097794,"score":11,"ups":11,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27834-e8633ed0-407a-47d3-bedf-4ffa2ff41bde-1566236768"}

{"body":"Oh, I'm just a typical American boy,\r\n\r\nFrom a typical American town;\r\n\r\nI believe in God, and Senator Dodd,\r\n\r\nAnd keepin' old Castro down.\r\n\r\nAnd when it came my time to serve,\r\n\r\nI knew \"better dead than red\",\r\n\r\nBut when I got to my old draft board\r\n\r\nBuddy, this is what I said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen,\r\n\r\nAnd I always carry a purse;\r\n\r\nI got eyes like a bat, my feet are flat\r\n\r\nAnd my asthma's gettin' worse.\r\n\r\nYes think of my career, my sweetheart dear,\r\n\r\nAnd my poor old invalid aunt;\r\n\r\nBesides, I ain't no fool, I'm a-goin' to school\r\n\r\nAnd I'm a-workin' in a defense plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI got a dislocated disc, and a racked-up back,\r\n\r\nI'm allergic to flowers and bugs;\r\n\r\nAnd when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits,\r\n\r\nAnd I'm addicted to a thousand drugs.\r\n\r\nI got the weakness woes, I can't touch my toes - \r\n\r\nI can hardly reach my knees - \r\n\r\nAnd if the enemy came close to me\r\n\r\nWhy, I'd probably start to sneeze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hate Chou En Lai, and I hope he dies,\r\n\r\nBut one thing you gotta see:\r\n\r\nThat someone's gotta go over there,\r\n\r\nAnd that someone isn't me.\r\n\r\nSo I wish you well, Sarge, give 'em hell;\r\n\r\nKill me a thousand or so,\r\n\r\nAnd if you ever get a war without blood and gore,\r\n\r\nI'll be the first to go.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vwwj","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1166986639,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"moom","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvxk1","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vwwj","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809321,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48785-55686b39-db8e-4d38-8d2d-ee42cd7807db-1566236777"}

No, it's not the end of the world.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the debt-to-GDP ratio, we're still in much better shape that some other countries.\r\n\r\nAlso, because our debt is financed in U.S. dollars, we will never default. The absolute worst-case scenario is that we have to devalue the dollar to pay off our debt. This is somewhat of a concern, but since most of our debt is held by Americans, repaying it will mostly be a matter of transferring funds from taxpayers to those who own the debt. Troubling for sure, but not the doom that this story claims.","link_id":"t3_v8uv","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808854,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"joshdick","edited":false,"id":"cv98r","parent_id":"t3_v8uv","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36507-7a27ba5e-9e66-4d5d-a03b-d8d392110e48-1566236772"}

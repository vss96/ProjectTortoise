{"body":"The calculator that he links to is pretty good.  I'd like to have it include light bulbs (I know it is an \"appliance\" calculator).  The only thing that really surprised me was the ceiling fan.  I have the one in my bedroom on 24/7 out of laziness, and I hate still air.  I'll be turning it off when I'm not home, and save like $5 a month.\r\n\r\nI've also not turned on my desktop computer in about 6 months.  Apparently, using my laptop instead has saved me over $200 (400w power supply + 2 19in CRT monitors + speaker system w/ sub).  I was using it for convenience, but it's good to know that I'm making some of the purchase price back in saved energy.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wa1x","subreddit":"science","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1167341099,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"praetorian42","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_wa1x","edited":false,"id":"cwahw","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809566,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55570-212dab89-0586-494d-a468-008b0a2020c9-1566236779"}

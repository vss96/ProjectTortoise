When I was in undergrad, from 1984 - 1988, and living in LA Co., I was truly poor (less than $5,000 a year annual income). I gave myself a budget of $10 a week for food and toiletries and I stuck with it for the most part. I didn't get a credit card until after I graduated from vet school in 1992, so not having that available as an out helped. Mostly, I lived on rice, potatoes, those giant bags of stale popcorn and those 5 lb rolls of cheap hamburger or whole chickens with green beans and lettuce.\r\n\r\n It's not easy, but it can be done. However, none of my friends or roommates wanted to do it. They preferred going into debt.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165026404,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":6,"score":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2676-7427be5d-7625-4e25-a804-66ed6bfc1148-1566236759"}

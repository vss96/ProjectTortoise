I'm a bartender so I think that qualifies me.  Do I know Cops? Yes, a few.  IN response to #1 the officer did not enter ther vehicle to search it he entered it to move it.  Yes he did look around with his flashlight but he did not violate anyones rights by doing so.  \r\nIn response to #2 Good for you.  You work out with cops.  You must be a freakin expert on the law then.  Not only was I a military policeman but I know a few cops. None of your agruments against what I said make any sense.  They are all invalid.  I refuse to get into this any further with some of you.  You have no deductive reasoning skills and your probably drunk too.  If you agree with this kid then act like him.  You won't get very far in life.  Granted with reasoning skills like yours it's lucky your still alive.","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60123-ade9480d-94de-4474-a0c5-d24ba0c591b4-1566236780"}

{"body":"In order to understand what China is really doing.\r\n\r\n(1) They artificially keep their currency low by pegging it to a \"basket of currencies\" (that is highly dependent on the dollar).\r\n\r\n(2) They restrain their currency from moving too far from this pegged amount by fiat.\r\n\r\n(3) They have a huge number of destitute poor that are willing to work for whatever rate they offer.\r\n\r\n(4) The result of all of this is China is in effect exploiting their own people to gain market-share. If the currency markets were truly efficient - the Yuan-USD exchange would price the Yuan up significantly. So, the Chinese government is forcing their poor to work 'below market wages' in effect.\r\n\r\nThis is why the US Govt is so insistent that China permit its currency to trade freely.\r\n\r\nThis will play itself out over the next decade. Eventually the search for cheap labor will move to Africa as China gains affluence.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vct7","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166545828,"author":"econo","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_vct7","edited":false,"id":"cvdd8","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808933,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38534-455663c5-24d8-46f1-81d7-88fcea00ea37-1566236773"}

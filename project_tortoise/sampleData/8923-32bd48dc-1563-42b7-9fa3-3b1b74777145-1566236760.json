The chief reason anyone sticks with Windows is because \"All my programs run there\". And more programs get written for Windows because that's the platform everyone has.\r\n\r\nEnter web applications. I can use Google Docs and Spreadsheets on any computer capable of running Firefox. Windows, OS X, Linux, dumb terminals, (eventually) cell phones, Negroponte's OLPC, etc. They're OS agnostic, and therefore drastically lower OS switching costs - if everything I used is on the web, what's it matter if I'm using Linux or Windows?\r\n\r\nIt's just like how Microsoft destroyed IBM's monopoly. It's not that the BIOS or chipset became unnecessary to become a computer, it's that they became irrelevant. Programmers stopped developing for particular hardware, and instead developed for the OS, letting the OS worry about the hardware. The web takes it a step further - you develop against web standards and let the browser worry about the OS.\r\n\r\nThey're not replacing the OS so much as they're making it irrelevant. As far as web applications are concerned, Linux over Windows matters about as much as choosing HP over Dell.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tly1","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807799,"author":"ejp1082","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctoe8","id":"ctp1j","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8923-32bd48dc-1563-42b7-9fa3-3b1b74777145-1566236760"}

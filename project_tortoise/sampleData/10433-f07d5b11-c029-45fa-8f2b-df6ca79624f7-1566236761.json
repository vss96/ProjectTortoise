What I don't understand is that you're not taught the difference between Romantic psychological, character-driven novel and genre, action-driven novels. You don't seem to read much genre literature in school, and in general action, sci-fi and fantasy are derided in mainstream, middle-class LitCrit circles.\r\n\r\nMind you, this is just my personal opinion as a cultural outsider (and a Spanish-speaking outsider, at that). However, keep in mind that it's perfectly reasonable for you as the reader to *not* have insight into a character's motivations above and beyond what you can empathize from their actions. It *doesn't* mean that the character is \"two-dimensional\" (whatever that means); it only means that you are not given the privilege of reading its \"mind\".\r\n\r\nWhat I consider a grave flaw in character development is to have inconsistent, unbelievable characters, in the sense that the state of mind and/or actions deriving therefrom don't form a reasonable \"history\" from episode to episode. However, I've rarely if ever read a remark of this tenor in literary reviews or critics in English.\r\n\r\n&gt; and the plot so turgid\r\n\r\nTurgidity is a proper attribute of *style*, not of plot: \"excessively embellished in style or language\" (M-W 10th). If you mean baroque, prolix, meandering, then: maybe (you should read Stross's *Accelerando* for a tour-de-force in ridiculousness of plot twists and complications. Not that I didn't enjoyed it).","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10433-f07d5b11-c029-45fa-8f2b-df6ca79624f7-1566236761"}

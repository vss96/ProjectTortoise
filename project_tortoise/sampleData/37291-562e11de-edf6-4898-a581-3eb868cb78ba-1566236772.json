We'd want him to break the rule we already established as right. \r\n\r\nThe hypothetical is not as stupid as the author makes it out to be, it's just not the right one to make when talking about what we put into legislation (ie, when we're talking about the establishment of a rule).","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1166492159,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37291-562e11de-edf6-4898-a581-3eb868cb78ba-1566236772"}

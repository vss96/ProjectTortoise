There still exists the fact that society (read: the parts of western society we are considering here) would and probably do consider me and my bound concubine to be immoral, even without religious sentiments getting involved, but you have provided some explanation for this - most of which I agree with. I would instead say that what is important is not 'never having sex before *the one*', but rather never having sex because masterbation seems like too much effort and is not squishy enough. But back to the main point -  I have had numerous partners before my girlfriend of today, one with whom I was with for two years. Yet I still do not understand why what I was doing with *any* of them was was wrong. In each case, what we were doing was fun (I hope) and brought us closer together. What I am getting at, perhaps, is the fact that modern societies need to stop seeing premarital/postmarital and start seeing f***buddies/relationship.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vh1r","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41502-583b9036-739c-48a7-b54e-2e548f6dae84-1566236773"}

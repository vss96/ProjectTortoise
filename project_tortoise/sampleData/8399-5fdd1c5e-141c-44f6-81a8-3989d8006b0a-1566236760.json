[...] The cores are ISA compatible and the fast cores can run kernel code as well (particularly when required by a system call), they just don't handle routine interrupts. \r\n\r\nWhat would then be the point of having a dedicated kernel CPU in the first place? Short response times don't go along with with having a single core\r\nprocessing IRQs sequentially (you just wouldn't be able to proccess another\r\nIRQ during the execution of the previous one). In a traditional approach, if a interrupt fires, the IOAPIC dispatches the IRQ to a CPU with a certain Interrupt Request Level. Therefor busy CPUs won't get interrupted by low\r\npriority Interrupts. Interrupt Handlers are threads or tasks (eg. your video driver) which are blocked unless their associated IRQ fires. Your slow kernel\r\nCPU surely doesn't want to run those and has to interrupt other CPUs anyway.\r\nYou also wouldn't be able to preempt CPUs independently. Just running the\r\nscheduler of all CPUs (a scheduler gets invoked either by systemcall or timer interrupt) on a single core (along with processing all the other IRQs in the queue) does not scale. CPUs usually idle most of the time because they are\r\nwaiting for an interrupt to be fired, if not they are not going to be interrupted (except by the scheduler), a less busy CPU will. I'd appreciate if you clarify what you think the advantage of such a low power kernel CPU would be (in comparison to the status quo) in terms of throughput, responsiveness and scalability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tj0f","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8399-5fdd1c5e-141c-44f6-81a8-3989d8006b0a-1566236760"}

This kid isn't nearly as big a danger as people who go out of their way to find young children (&lt;14) to forcibly rape.  This kid got a blowjob from a girl at a party that he might not even have known was 15 (I remember when 15 year old's didn't have C and D cups).  When he gets out of prison 10 years from now being completely worthless he might be a danger but that doesn't have to happen.  He got drunk and did something stupid...SO DID THE GIRL WHO GOT \"RAPED\".  If both of them were drunk, who's to blame?\r\n\r\nThe real problem is he needs a better lawyer.

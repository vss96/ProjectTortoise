{"controversiality":0,"body":"While these parents do not sound like autonomous educators,  they did seem to facilitate child-lead learning.  I support children who want to learn whole-heartedly.  If he's ready at 11 - he's ready.  I sincerely hope my small fry maintains the desire and passion to learn.  If he keeps at his pace, he may be like this great little guy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if my kid was in college at 11 and saying things like I just want more time with friends and family - my advice as a parent would be to say - *sounds like a great idea.  Let's do it!  Better yet, let's define your goals and see what we can do in our community together to put your book learning into practice.* \r\n\r\nThat's what parents should do.  Listen, evaluate, facilitate, nuture, support, offer choices and guide.  (And occasionally put your foot down and make very unpopular decisions which make your child scream \"I hate you!\")  \r\n\r\nI'd rather hear about an over-achieving kid - than a kid who is so tuned out that their parent has to leave him at a Buddist monastary for 2 years.","link_id":"t3_uhfb","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165882634,"score":8,"ups":8,"author":"svaha","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cui76","parent_id":"t3_uhfb","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808348,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23664-4fec3af0-a7ae-404b-9fc9-9aa23abedc4e-1566236766"}

I have found the service, quality and knowledge of medical workers here to be atrocious.  When my daughter was hospitalized, I was shocked to discover that doctors worked weekdays from 9 - 5.  She had to wait until the on-call doctor responded (four hours) just to have her pain meds adjusted.  Four hours of unnecessary pain because the doctors just don't feel their lives should be bothered by someone discourteous enough to get sick on a weekend.  \r\n\r\nI'd like to see docs in the U.S. try that!  Lawsuits would abound.  I don't like the fact that we- Americans -  are so litigious.  But, in this instance, at least we can get appropriate medical treatment.\r\n\r\nAnd I fall over laughing when people tell me I should be grateful because it is free.  Tell that to the hefty chunk missing from my paycheck every month.","created_utc":1167318567,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54941-9647c15c-f001-4ef6-a655-da1c015a1979-1566236779"}

There was a large pattern of Muslim religious leaders who opposed a law that would better protect women from rape.  This indicates a big cultural difference between my nation and theirs.  I don't think there's really anything to debate here.  These are just facts.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I'm aware that the current laws nominally provide punishments for rapists.  However, the current laws make it *effectively* impossible to prove rape.  Hence, the title \"anti-rape\" for the new laws is not simplistic at all.  The current laws are at best rape neutral.\r\n\r\nThe entire last paragraph contains nothing I disagree with and is a non-sequitur.\r\n\r\nPeace . . . someday, but not today.","link_id":"t3_tdo4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165196705,"ups":0,"score":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5724-5289cd46-430f-4f8b-888c-7ae8464f9978-1566236759"}

I agree the point is crap, but some of the other ones are pretty good.\r\n\r\nThe second half of that sentence is important too. IIRC different Lisp implementations can/do have their own gc implementation(s). Considering how highly Lisp performance is tied to the garbage collector (see the second point listed) this could be an important issue.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7456-36b2fb9c-e282-4916-a4d8-2e9a509f8412-1566236760"}

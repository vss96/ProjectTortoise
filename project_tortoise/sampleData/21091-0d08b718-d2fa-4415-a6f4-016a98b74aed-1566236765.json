Sorry to burst your little bubble there.\r\n\r\nI'll admit I was under a similar mistaken impression until I actually got an apartment in a smoking-allowed complex, thinking that I could just fix any holes and I'd be fine.  It was afterwards that I found out that cigarette smoke will actually penetrate ordinary drywall.  Presumably the stuff that is used for exterior walls (and it's not even required for all of them) is not quite so permeable.\r\n\r\nThese days I pay a premium to live in an apartment complex where smoking is not allowed inside the apartments.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ubmh","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808257,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Joss","parent_id":"t1_cudan","edited":false,"id":"cudh6","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21091-0d08b718-d2fa-4415-a6f4-016a98b74aed-1566236765"}

Wtf do you think all the clamor about peak oil is for?  Nobody is addressing the problem, coal gassification (which is NOT cheaper than oil, that's ludicrous) plants are not being built, ethanol is not a realistic solution (1-2% efficiency in conversion of solar to usable energy, versus PV at nearly 20% efficiency available today with claims of 40% in the future), no large scale PV plans are on the drawing board...transitioning from oil + natural gas infrastructure to the next thing is going to take decades.  We have to start, in earnest.  \"There's no problem here\" is wrong.  We have a big problem.","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167406969,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cwd2q","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwcl7","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809615,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56846-e304e9a7-6efc-4b14-92b5-e30f2d3efc31-1566236779"}

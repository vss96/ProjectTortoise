To some extent, that is true. But the nature of reality -- whatever it may be -- is not subject to our desires.\r\n\r\nIf someone sees evidence for a god and acknowledges this, he does not become dogmatic and sheepish for that observation. Similarly, if someone fails to see evidence for a god, he does not become a brave individualist who does not need a god.\r\n\r\nWe can become many of the things which are attributed to our models of reality, but we do not have to. A believer may wish there were no god and an atheist may wish there were a god.\r\n\r\nWhat we perceive as reality need not change who we are.","link_id":"t3_tbyh","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165077738,"score":5,"ups":5,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3355-fb4d6b7e-cdf1-41a0-b4f4-58a8def42fd8-1566236759"}

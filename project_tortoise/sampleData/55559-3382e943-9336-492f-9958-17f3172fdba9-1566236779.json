I'm talking about the economic realities of the working poor.  You can't make do with less if you're living on the edge to start with.  Unschooling is too expensive for these people.  It isn't free - it has a cost in lost wages.  To take it further, education for their children has an immediate cost.  The cost is the lost labor from their children.  Without public education, you will see literacy plummet in this country to third world levels.\r\n\r\nIf unschooling takes off, it will take off among the more affluent.  These people, no longer having a stake in public education will work to kill its funding, raising the drawbridge against class mobility.  Eventually this will kill the economic engine that drives this country.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w4pi","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809566,"author":"jvance","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw90b","id":"cwah9","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55559-3382e943-9336-492f-9958-17f3172fdba9-1566236779"}

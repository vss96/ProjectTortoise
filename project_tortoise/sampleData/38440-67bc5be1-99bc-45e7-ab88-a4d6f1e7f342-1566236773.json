In that book is a simple solution to both the current and future Social Security and Medicare problems.  As baby boomers, it is in our best interest to keep the solution away from you.  We figure that the solution to the current Social Security and Medicare problem is so obvious that anyone should be able to figure it out.\r\n\r\nAnd, like you said, as the largest single generation of people in the United States, we are to blame.  We have made the world a horrible, horrible place.  Each of us deserves the life that we have given ourselves and we are glad that you cherish in our suffering.

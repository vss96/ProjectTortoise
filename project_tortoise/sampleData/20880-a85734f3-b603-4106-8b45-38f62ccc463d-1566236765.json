I find it odd that all these people decided to leave feedback over a three day period.\r\n\r\nBut the auctions in question ended at very different times -- early to late November.\r\n\r\nPerhaps each isolated buyer was patient with the seller, hoping to salvage something from a deal that seems to have gone sour -- until they saw the growing collection of new negative feedbacks in the seller's profile. Then it's impossible to pretend that things are still going to be OK. Disgruntled buyers pile on, the growing pile encourages more victims to speak up, etc.\r\n\r\nSomeone in my family was the victim of a similar scammer on Amazon some time ago, and there was a very similar \"snowball effect\" in that case. The scammer had gotten away with this scheme for quite a while, but once a few victims spoke up, the outpouring of anger was pretty sudden.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, the same sudden explosion of victims sometimes shows up in other serial-victimizer situations, like rape, molestation, confidence games, etc.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20880-a85734f3-b603-4106-8b45-38f62ccc463d-1566236765"}

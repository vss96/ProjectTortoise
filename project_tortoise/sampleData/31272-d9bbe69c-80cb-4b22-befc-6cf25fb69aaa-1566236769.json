It's absolutely pointless to worry about th overhead of cat. In typical incremental fashion, you'd start out with \r\n\r\nhead somefile | sort | grep this | awk 'bla'\r\n\r\n(yes, I know, awk can do the grep). The point is that once you're satisfied that the little pipeline works as intended, you simply replace 'head' with 'cat'. This is much easier than rewriting it as\r\n\r\n sort  &lt; somefile | grep this | awk 'bla'\r\n\r\nwhich has the added disadvantage that the 'flow' is less natural. The fact that this author can be bothered to moan about cat shows that he has done too little scripting. \r\n\r\nedit: grmpf. It now appears that 'modern' shells allow the construct \r\n\r\n&lt; somefile sort | grep this | awk 'bla'\r\n\r\nwhich is the same as cat somefile ... (this used to be a syntax error. Maybe a rudiment of my csh past though). Still, cat has lots of interesting options, see its man page. \r\n\r\nedit2: first '|' was wrong. Removed it, but this makes the pipeline even less intuitive ...","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31272-d9bbe69c-80cb-4b22-befc-6cf25fb69aaa-1566236769"}

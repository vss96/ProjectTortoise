To be a \"rebel\" you have to use some obscure language that, at the very least, can be used to produce a web site and talk to MySQL.  A true title is \"Languages Rarely Used Except By Closet Nerds\".  Linux is a closet nerd project, so this doesn't mean that someday it may challenge Microsoft (the man).  First, the established evils:\r\n\r\n1. C++\r\n\r\n2. Java\r\n\r\n3. .NET (in particular, C# VB.NET and ASP.NET)\r\n\r\n4. PHP\r\n\r\nNow the rebels (usually without a cause):\r\n\r\n1. OCaml\r\n\r\n2. Lisp\r\n\r\n3. Haskel\r\n\r\n4. Scheme\r\n\r\nSitting on the bench, trying to look cool:\r\n\r\n1. Ruby\r\n\r\n2.

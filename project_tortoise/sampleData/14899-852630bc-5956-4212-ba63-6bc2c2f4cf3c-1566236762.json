It doesn't fit in another application, because a tag is in fact just another object (with a many-to-many relationship to the tagged items) in your existing application. It also doesn't belong in middleware. Then where do you put it? You can't possible build it from scratch every time you need it?\r\n\r\nYou'd just use it as an app with nothing but a models.py file for tags. Calling it an 'app' can be misleading. You can have an entire user polling app, or a forum app, but in a lot of other cases you might just have an 'app' which serves to implement tagging or even something like template filters.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14899-852630bc-5956-4212-ba63-6bc2c2f4cf3c-1566236762"}

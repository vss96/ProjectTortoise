I was stating a blatent fact that they have documents of a person who was baptised by John the Baptist, called Jesus, and that he was crucified. [Here's](http://www.issuesetc.org/resource/archives/maier3.htm) a page that gives a quick summary.\r\n\r\nThere's also quite a few reasonable explinations for things like Jesus turning water into wine, people think they mean wine like *we* drink. The Romans considered that barbaric, they mixed it with water at like 1 part wine to 3/5 water. Jesus simply mixed a good drink, that's my opinion if it happened.\r\n\r\nOh and Dawkins is breeding his own dogmatic religion. There's no proof that there isn't a god and Dawkins is asking people to have **faith** that there isn't a god, I'm sorry but that's the same as any other religion. Atheism has its own religious wackos preaching the word of no-god, trying to get people to believe what *they* want them to believe. How is that any different from religion?\r\n\r\nStalin was a Leninist-Marxist, oh and atheist. Hitler, adopted Eugenics a direct descendent of Darwins theory, in fact hinted at it in it, and also the theory backed by atheists. Castro, based on Marxism again and do I need to mention his religious oppression? Mao again Marxist and look what happened to China with atheism.\r\n\r\nI personally don't believe either, I'm a so called \"weak atheist\" and that should be the position of every intellectual person basing their beliefs on facts. There is no evidence for or against god, so the natural place to be is in the middle because that's where the lack of facts points.\r\n\r\nThis is why I hate Dawkins, he's as much scum as the religious. He bases his belief on faith, his mind is so small he can't imagine the other position. Darwin's Theory is his bible and the atheist societies are trying to draft a 'moral guideline', hell put the two together and you've got the damn bible in different words.\r\n\r\nOh, and for the record Darwins theory is quite wrong about evolution because it doesn't factor in society or chance. The fittest don't always survive, sometimes they're the least likely to survive.","link_id":"t3_vcwg","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39971-c334d8bd-936c-475d-92d6-674f3cd776dc-1566236773"}

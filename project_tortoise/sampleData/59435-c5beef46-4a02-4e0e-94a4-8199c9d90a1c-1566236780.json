Survivors said that the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river.\r\n\r\n&gt; * The Mongols looted and then destroyed. Mosques, palaces, libraries, hospitals—grand buildings that had been the work of generations—were burned to the ground.\r\n\r\n&gt; [...]\r\n\r\n&gt; Baghdad was a depopulated, **ruined city for several centuries** and only gradually recovered some of its former glory.\r\n\r\n&gt; [...]\r\n\r\n&gt; The Mongol destruction of Baghdad was a psychological blow from which Islam never recovered. [...] With the sack of Baghdad, **the intellectual flowering of Islam was snuffed out.** Imagining the Athens of Pericles and Aristotle obliterated by a nuclear weapon begins to suggest the enormity of the blow. The Mongols filled in the irrigation canals and left Iraq too depopulated to restore them.\r\n","score":9,"ups":9,"created_utc":1167528586,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59435-c5beef46-4a02-4e0e-94a4-8199c9d90a1c-1566236780"}

{"body":"Guys, don't waste your breath on this one. This \"nullity\" crap is clearly a hoax. Obviously one can define x/0 in any way they want, the issue is that once you do so 100 years of results into abstract algebra and topology no longer hold; so either you're left with a useless number system, or you have to re-invent everything yourself. This guy knows this, he's just trying to get a raise out of people. Or maybe he's just not very smart. Either way you won't convince him that he is wrong. He probably doesn't even know what an \"abelian group\" or a \"topological space\" is.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u2jy","subreddit":"programming","score":16,"ups":16,"created_utc":1165552524,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"cu2pe","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u2jy","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808055,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15355-1f6439d2-4b0e-43a0-8608-a4ea2b4cbdb3-1566236762"}

{"body":"&gt;I suppose that filming in wider angles has a greater technical difficulty associated with it.\r\n\r\nNot really...  You use a wide-angle lens or you just back up.  If every shot in a movie showed more of the surroundings, there'd be no close-ups.  That's done sometimes.  \"In the Company of Men\" comes to mind.  But more often than not it just results in lack of impact in important places.\r\n\r\nAs a side-note... most movies are originally the equivalent of 3500p (though progressive doesn't mean much when we're talking about randomized points instead of rasterized pixels).  So really, anything shot on 35mm is getting down-converted by at least a factor of 3 before it hits even a 1080p set.  \r\n\r\nI suppose if you want more FOV, you can go to an IMAX and check out some massively wide angle 70mm footage.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wgos","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167556270,"ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"wockyman","parent_id":"t1_cwgwj","edited":false,"id":"cwj47","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809728,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59923-95852cd9-de21-40a5-97f2-3b6e2dfa40ad-1566236780"}

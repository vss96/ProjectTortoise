The U.S. and other developed nations could harm their economies and temperatures could still rise or temperatures could decline with the start of another ice age.  Climate models are exceedingly complex and we lack a comprehensive body of data about global temperature for a long enough time to conclude much with authority.  Solar output is not constant and we don't know what solar output will be like over the next century.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vm6j","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809125,"author":"degustibus","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvn38","id":"cvnab","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43547-b949b7f2-bbea-41f1-bd8d-84f47710affc-1566236774"}

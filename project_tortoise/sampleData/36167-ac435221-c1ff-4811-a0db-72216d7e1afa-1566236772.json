Your $50 for Bill Gates' $100M may very well be equivalent gains as a percentage of your annual income, however, in terms of utility they're not equal in the slightest.\r\n\r\nFor some poor sot making minimum wage, a gain of $50 or $500 allows that person to eat better food, get that prescription filled, or live in a slightly less dangerous part of town.  Giving Bill Gates an extra $50K has no effect on his ability to gain food, shelter or healthcare.\r\n\r\nThe \"fairness\" of the tax cut distribution shouldn't be determined on a strictly percentage-of-income basis, as the benefit (utility) of that cut is inversely proportional to one's income.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v75j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166461926,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36167-ac435221-c1ff-4811-a0db-72216d7e1afa-1566236772"}

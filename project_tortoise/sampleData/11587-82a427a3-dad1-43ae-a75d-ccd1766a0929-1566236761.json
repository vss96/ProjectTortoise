The \"how do I make a self-contained executable\" is a symptom of this expectation. \"The first thing I did when I learned C was 'gcc hello-world.c -o hello; ./hello', so that's the first thing I'm going to do in Lisp.\"\r\n\r\nI guess one analogy that pops into my head is a transportation one: trains may be able to haul more cargo than a truck, or go faster than a bus, but it depends on tracks. Hopping in a train engine hoping to go down the highway will be a disappointment. But is that the fault of the train or the expectation? And does it mean that trains suck and are unsuitable for the real world?","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_tksn","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165419734,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11587-82a427a3-dad1-43ae-a75d-ccd1766a0929-1566236761"}

A study was done a few years ago that showed how econ students behaved in social dilemma games, like the prisoner's dilemma and the ultimatum game.  They found a strong correlation between year in program and selfishness.  \r\n\r\nIf you talk to most econ professors (or business professors) you would be surprised to how many are quite liberal.  Econ doesn't teach that the government mucks thing up necessarily: some examples, problems and theories might lend credence to that thought, but there are plenty of examples that show optimal outcomes are not possible without a third-party like the government.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, it mainly applies to those who study econ in-depth, whereas most people are exposed only to a 'pidgen' econ.  I could definitely see an argument made for this econ making someone think more conservatively.","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39677-22f988fd-9cdd-49cc-abd9-83e82c54479e-1566236773"}

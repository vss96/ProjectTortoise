This is because they tend to imagine how they would run the government instead of looking at how it operates in reality.\r\n\r\nYou should cite what you mean by \"leftists.\" After all, I think it's easier to find \"rightists\" who believe in a powerful authoritarian gov't. In fact, the so-called \"authoritarian left\", which includes Marxist-Leninists, sounds like a contradiction in terms to me. They were the ruling class of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nWhat's called the \"left\" constitutes a spectrum of ideas, parts of which are interested in less fundamental change than others. Same with the right.\r\n\r\nSevere criticisms of pure capitalism [also come from the right](http://www.amconmag.com/2005_03_14/article1.html).

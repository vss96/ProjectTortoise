There is almost nothing you can do in space that a robot can’t do cheaper.  However when you read Sci Fi novels it’s usually not the robot that you read about.  You read about someone you can identify with doing the extraordinary.  \r\n\r\nCertain people have inspired me and often they are explorers take Shackleton, Armstrong, and Columbus to name a few.  They had faults for sure, but the idea of going somewhere that is new is lost for most humans.  I don’t really care if the moon or mars are worth it, it is the idea that we are exploring new places that has a huge impact on how I see humanity.   Sure we could leave it for future generations to do when they have cheaper propulsion and better electronics but exploring shouldn’t be easy.  We can do it now and I believe we should.  Maybe if the country was behind an expensive trip to the moon they wouldn’t be so concerned with fighting a war.  Sound familiar?\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808131,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu6rf","parent_id":"t3_u5vc","author":"Fountainhead","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17453-33fa3b27-8633-4785-827f-e3e9cdf1960f-1566236763"}

But yes, many Christians vote Republican simply because out of the two candidates provided them, one of them is pro-choice, and one of them is pro-life; there is a tendency for many Christians to be one-issue voters. Again, though, it's one thing to be pro-life, it's another thing to think that you're supporting life when you try to blow people up. You can't lump pro-life supporters and pro-life politicians in with deranged bombers. Nobody supports them.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"5980-1d6127f8-3ea3-4e1a-b3b3-93b6578d4cbd-1566236760"}

Just like warnings for people with peanut allergies, it is your responsibility to respond to the warning.  The government does not make food distributors provide non-peanut products.  *That* would be \"might makes right\".\r\n\r\nThe only time the government forces someone to provide a non-peanut alternative food is when the government is also forcing you to be there (public school).\r\n\r\n&gt;There's a difference between action and circumstance.\r\n\r\nBuying and walking a pet is an action, not a circumstance.\r\n\r\n&gt;I'm plenty allergic to animals, but I don't complain about that.\r\n\r\nYou should expand that attitude to include outside smoke.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165943075,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25109-2bc706fc-5112-4055-b071-f53ab418140d-1566236767"}

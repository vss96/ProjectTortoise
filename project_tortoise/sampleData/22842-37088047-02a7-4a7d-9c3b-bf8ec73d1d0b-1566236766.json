To be blunt, you have a narrow mind about this topic, and you can't draw logical conclusions that way.\r\n\r\nI'll try to explain. The Jews were never allowed to say God's name outloud - that's why we're not sure if they called him Yahweh or Jehovah, all we have are the four letters that made up his name. In fact, modern Jews many times won't write God, they'll write \"G-d\" instead. This is because they believed that to name something is to, to some degree, own something. That's why your neighbors don't name your kids- they're your kids (implying some sort of posession), so you name them. So when Moses said in the Bible \"who should I say sent me\", the burning bush replied, \"I am that I am\". So people don't exert ownership over God. There's also this belief that to name something is to limit something. As soon as you say \"God is Love\", it implies that God is not Not Love, or that God is not Hate. The paradox here is that you can't limit the definition of God this way- God is Love, AND God is Hate. If God is truly the source for everything in the universe, then there couldn't be anything such as an original thought that God didn't \"think\" first. (I say \"think\" in quotes because, for all intents in purposes, it's easier for people to think that God actually thinks, but if God spans time, then God doesn't really commit an action because actions are defined by time. More so that God \"knows\". This is an incomplete explanation, but it's not really the point, so oh well.) God is infinitely multifaceted. If each emotion or ability were to be a set where the members of that set were beings that displayed that emotion or had that ability, God would be the only member of all sets simultaneously. If a human were to be in just two opposing sets, we'd consider that person to be a walking contradiction, or a hypocrite. But it's one of the great paradoxes about God, that God can be both wonderful and terrible at the same time.\r\n\r\nI hope I'm not wasting my time in explaining this to you, it's a tough concept to really grasp- a lot of Christians don't understand it. Many Christians will deny or gloss over the fact that unappealing (to us) traits exist within God. This is why some churches might preach God as a god of love, or as a god of fire and brimstone. They'll highlight whichever aspects of God they want in order to make their point, but the truth is that God is both.\r\n\r\nYou seem to imply that God can't be a god of both- I wonder if you are making that judgment based on the idea that absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is true for man, but stems from the fallen imperfect nature of man. In any case, it's a flawed logical leap, and I really think you need to reexamine what you believe to be true and why you believe it to be that way.\r\n\r\nMaybe this graphic helps explain what I mean about arguing over the internet: \r\nhttp://aram.xkcd.com:8080/imgsample/internet%20argument.jpg","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165862760,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuf95","id":"cugsd","author_flair_text":null,"author":"carpeliam","retrieved_on":1473808319,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22842-37088047-02a7-4a7d-9c3b-bf8ec73d1d0b-1566236766"}

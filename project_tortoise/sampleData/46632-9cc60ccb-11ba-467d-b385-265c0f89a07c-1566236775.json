If it was the case that function pointers are the same as closures, we would not need closure conversion in compilers anymore. Hence, the space of languages with and without closures would be the same.\r\n\r\nThink about it. There would be no need to heap-allocate closure objects, so we could just compile all closures a program could construct once and for all. In this world, it would also be fun to program C, Java and C++. I could make money off doing something fun!\r\n\r\n","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166838503,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46632-9cc60ccb-11ba-467d-b385-265c0f89a07c-1566236775"}

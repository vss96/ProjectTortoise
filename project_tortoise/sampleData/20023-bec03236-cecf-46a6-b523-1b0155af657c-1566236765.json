I have zero empathy for such a person who says \"I as an atheist have just as much right to speak in this country as you do as a Christian\" -- and this same person downvotes anyone who says they are a Christian in their post. The good news is, so long as atheists continue to act this way --- their movement will never get far. The mainstream american public will never embrace them for being anything other than elitists.","score":-2,"ups":-2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165752662,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20023-bec03236-cecf-46a6-b523-1b0155af657c-1566236765"}

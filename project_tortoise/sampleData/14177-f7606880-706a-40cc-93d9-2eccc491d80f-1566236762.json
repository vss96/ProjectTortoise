So just because n/0 is currently undefined in common math doesn't mean it will always be that way. IMHO it seems to me that anything divided by zero ought to be defined as infinity, or at least \"nullity\" is more descriptive than \"undefined\". \r\n\r\nAs a programmer I find it really dumbass stupid that the standard programming languages feel it necessary to STOP THE APPLICATION that commits the unspeakable sin of attempted *gasp* divide by zero. I mean, really, divide by zero is a HALTABLE crime in the world of programming??? So what if it's undefined, just return a value of \"undefined\" and allow the app to continue, for chrissake! I can't blame this guy for proposing a more reasonable approach than \"DIVIDE BY ZERO! KILL THE APPLICATION! RED ALERT! GO TO DEFCON 2!!!\"\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165514928,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-22,"ups":-22,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14177-f7606880-706a-40cc-93d9-2eccc491d80f-1566236762"}

Charge them more for life insurance if you must, but don't even attempt to dictate how they live their lives.\r\n\r\nHealth care is already based upon \"health habits\".  Company health care could take into account the individual health habits of individuals. If they are not doing this, don't blame the individual, blame the morons who are providing the health care.  And certainly, don't empower a company to discriminate (by firing) an employee that has a lifestyle choice that they don't approve of.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22829-8f57f1c2-a556-4910-9e9a-10cdfb7560d9-1566236766"}

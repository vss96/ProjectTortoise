The Ruby link looks a lot more spartan, to me.\r\n\r\nI suppose you're right, i just prefer the layout in the Ruby one\r\n\r\n&gt;I think python is a little less OO than Ruby/Smalltalk in that it would be considered more pythonic to write a function to do those things. By the way, flatten can be found in the goopy code-base, or you could roll your own (it's 7 lines). I dunno what a sorted dictionary is, but same deal\r\n\r\nMaybe this is just a matter of taste, but in my eyes this is a bit like sending a carpenter a toolkit with no nails and saying 'well make one, it's just a pointy bit of metal'. I want all these things (and more) done for me; and if i don't like the way they're done i'll override them,\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165239565,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"ctjtg","parent_id":"t1_ctjnh","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807702,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6502-13efe804-d915-418e-9213-8b07f8f2d9b9-1566236760"}

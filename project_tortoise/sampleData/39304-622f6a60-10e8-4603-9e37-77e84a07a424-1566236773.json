When I knew Iraq was a giant lie and that we were looking at endless unregulated military expenses and that the there would be no honest accounting for years if ever. The decision to go to war for no reason, was the signal that the the administration and the rest of the nation by proxy were going to pay a HUGE penalty. The rest of the world couldn't believe how stupid we were and some of us remain, but then they didn't understand why we attempted to impeach Clinton either.\r\n\r\nBy August 2003 everyone who was paying attention knew that the administration had put out enough rope to hang itself and it was just a matter of time to wait for collection.\r\n\r\nYou bet on the dollar going up, and I'll ride you all the way down and laugh to the bank.

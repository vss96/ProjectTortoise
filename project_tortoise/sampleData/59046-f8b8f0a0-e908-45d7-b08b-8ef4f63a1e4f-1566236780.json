Please blow in this straw.\"* is a legitimate, Constitutional approach the police could have taken. The purpose of the stop must be to thwart drunk drivers, not to catch other stuff in the car.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wgpl","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809697,"author":"anonymous-coward","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cwhh0","parent_id":"t1_cwhfq","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59046-f8b8f0a0-e908-45d7-b08b-8ef4f63a1e4f-1566236780"}

On the other hand, if you're reading something written entirely in hiragana, there's no chance you'll stumble on an unknown character.  \r\n\r\n&gt; There are a LOT of homophones in Japanese -- words with different meanings that sound the same (and are spelled the same in kana). You can tell these apart in normal writing because they are written with different kanji.\r\n\r\nIn spoken Japanese, you don't have kanji to differentiate homophones, but Japanese speakers seem to manage well enough.  I don't see why written Japanese couldn't eventually go the same way.  (On the other hand, I don't speak Japanese, so I may be missing some important details.)","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50319-c7462ab0-edb4-4412-ba3e-e83c50065216-1566236778"}

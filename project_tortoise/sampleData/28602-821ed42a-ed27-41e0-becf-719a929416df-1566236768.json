And those are only of use... for sending more humans in space.\r\n\r\nAnd sending humans in space doesn't make any sense until we've got a much cheaper and more reliable launch systems going.  Which NASA can't do... because we have the Shuttle.\r\n\r\nNot to mention all the really good science going on with the robot probes.  Imagine what else we'd discover, if we had a few more missions to Venus, Mars, and the Jovians.  The billions spend on the Shuttle and ISS would greatly increase the amount of science we can do.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_us2a","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28602-821ed42a-ed27-41e0-becf-719a929416df-1566236768"}

This is interesting, I wasn't aware of this. Can you cite any sources connecting a politician who represents the religious right with someone like David McMenemy? Even in spirit, I don't see anyone lending any amount of political support to any actions in this vein. As far as environmental groups go, I would consider Greenpeace and Peta to have lobbying power, and that's much more mainstream than McMenemy, so I'd tend to disagree with you, but if you can provide evidence, I'm willing to be swayed. (Peta's not technically environmental, but you could still argue that their actions border on terrorism.)\r\n\r\nIn any case, the article was clearly relating Christian zealots to \"Arab or Muslim\" terrorists, not any of these less serious brands of terrorists. As much as people (me included) hate to talk about how 9/11 has changed our culture, the cultural definition of \"terrorist\" has become more narrow after 9/11. Yes, it's true that the ELF can be considered a terrorist group, but they're not the first thing anybody thinks of when you say the word \"terrorist\" now. It would be one thing if the author was explicitly comparing Christian zealots to other 'lower class terrorist groups' so to speak, but she's not; that's not her agenda at all.","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1165055003,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3103-24092654-b4da-4691-a86d-621f20eba3ea-1566236759"}

They allow to abstract many things which can just be implemented as libraries in Haskell whereas they need to be hardcoded in the language for most of the other programming languages. \r\n\r\nIndeed, most programming languages already contain a few monads in their definition and you have to use them. No choice. You can't avoid them, you can't replace them by different monads according to your needs. In Haskell, you have this freedom.","link_id":"t3_u5jo","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808123,"distinguished":null,"author":"alpheccar","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cu6br","parent_id":"t1_cu5rv","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17167-1e1264a7-d956-4193-a194-d19466ced413-1566236763"}

As long as there is a global economy then one of the paper currencies will still be of value. Use that one. Or hell, buy real estate. The rights to the dirt itself is always going to have some value, as long as property rights are enforced. In contrast, gold by itself is freaking worthless. What are you going to do with it besides wish you had a means of melting it into jewelry? \r\n\r\nIn any event, the paper based economy is controlled by the various central banks of the world, and now that economics is a more mature science, the central banks seem to have a pretty good idea of how to keep economies from completely collapsing. Sure, we still get business cycles busts and recessions, but when the US economy tanks, it will look like Japan in the 90s, not Germany in the 30s. In contrast, the bankers don't care about the gold market, so no one is trying to stabilize it, and it's subject to whims of gold mine discoveries and industrial use. Thus, if the market for gold craters tomorrow, they won't do anything to cushion the blow, and you'll be left with nothing but worthless yellow metal.","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166594507,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40353-71f14ec4-2269-49b5-b6fa-420ce5e38862-1566236773"}

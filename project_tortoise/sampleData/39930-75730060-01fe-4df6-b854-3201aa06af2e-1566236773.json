{"body":"&gt; To play the devil's advocate for a second, why should non-citizens be extended the rights of citizens (i.e. due process, habeus corpus, etc)?\r\n\r\nBecause due process is a human right, and we are all human beings. Let the law judge and harshly punish the guilty. To believe that certain people are entitled to due process, and others aren't simply because they were born in some worse country, is selfish to the point of evil.\r\n\r\nI believe the framework of America which was laid out by the founding fathers represented the greatest hope for humanity. To whatever (arguably lesser) extent that those ideals persist to this day, why wouldn't I want that standard for all people?\r\n\r\n- [\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that **all** men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\"](http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/declaration.html)\r\n\r\n- [\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\"](http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Ethic_of_reciprocity)\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vcii","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1166578650,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"jerry","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvfv2","parent_id":"t1_cvfph","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808981,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39930-75730060-01fe-4df6-b854-3201aa06af2e-1566236773"}

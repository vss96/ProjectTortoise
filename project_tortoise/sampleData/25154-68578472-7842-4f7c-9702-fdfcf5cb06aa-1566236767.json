And having followed music and the music industry very closely since about 1982, there's far more music out there today, and far more available, than ever before.\r\n\r\nTo cite just one example, the [Trance Europe Express](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_m/105-9584459-8201253?url=search-alias%3Dpopular&amp;field-keywords=Trance+Europe+Express&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go) series from the long defunkt Volume label were unavailable for years, no matter how many CD shops you drove to. I can buy them all for a pittance now. They are a great set of trance collections.\r\n\r\nMy friends are mostly in their 40s now and few of them bother buying new music anymore. My nieces and nephews, of course, are big spenders in this area.\r\n\r\nSince any artist can put their music online, and the cost of recording your music has come down to one little Mac with GarageBand, the real problem is not the quantity of new music but sorting the good from the bad. I would speculate there's an order of magnitude more new music available today versus 20 years ago.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165944479,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25154-68578472-7842-4f7c-9702-fdfcf5cb06aa-1566236767"}

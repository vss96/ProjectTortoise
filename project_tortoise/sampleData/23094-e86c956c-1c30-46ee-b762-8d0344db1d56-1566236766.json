{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt;according to Mormon Scripture, God commanded Mormon founder Joseph Smith to marry women \"a hundred fold\" \r\n\r\nFor those of you who haven't clicked on the link, the \"hundred fold\" quote isn't in vv 62-63, but in verse 55, which ldsgems has twisted significantly:\r\n\r\n&gt;55 But if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply him and give unto him an hundredfold in this world, of fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal worlds.\r\n\r\nWhile additional wives (and other things) are promised as blessings in that section, it's certainly not a commandment to marry, since by extension he'd have to come up with a hundredfold mothers, brothers, houses, etc.  The only commandment related to polygamy is for Emma (and other wives) to accept the law or be destroyed.  Everywhere else that it talks about ten virgins there's a nice little \"if\" clause stating that God has to give them to the man.  Now, to a non-believer this just means that when the guy's horny he needs to claim it's a revelation.  But the \"official\" church position is at least logically consistent: No where does God command polygamy in scripture, but he certainly leaves open the possibility that he would allow it (there is \"righteous\" polygamy in both D&amp;C and Bible).","link_id":"t3_ud3o","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165868420,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"plexluthor","edited":false,"id":"cuh85","parent_id":"t1_cudz9","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808328,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23094-e86c956c-1c30-46ee-b762-8d0344db1d56-1566236766"}

Imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery. :)\r\n\r\nI'd really like to see this Scheme library as well, it looks interesting, and I'd like to see how it compares with HXT's model of doing things. It does make the point that some of HXT's names for things could certainly be improved. (especially selem/aelem/sattr)\r\n\r\nI also should perhaps point out that I didn't really work very hard at producing the most concise version of the code that I could, there's an intermediate data structure in there which it probably would not be too bad to eliminate, and I'm a total newbie with RSS and HXT (this is basically the first program I wrote using it after skimming the tutorial, by hunting through the docs for the bits that I needed). I was happy enough about the fact that it was 50 lines, and didn't take very long at all to write.\r\n\r\nI think these examples in Haskell and Scheme say more about the power of embedded domain specific languages than they do about the respective base languages. :) Of course, a good argument for EDSLs is a good argument for functional programming. :)","score":11,"ups":11,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166564479,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t3_vebh","edited":false,"id":"cvexz","author":"cgibbard","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808963,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39395-f80555c3-3064-4f0e-8fed-610d99b64297-1566236773"}

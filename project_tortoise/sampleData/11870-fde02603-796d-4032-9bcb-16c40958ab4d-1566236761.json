Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who runs her 7-year-old daughter's Brownie troop meetings on Monday afternoons in Weston, Fla. \"I'll have to talk to the other mothers and see if we can move it to the weekend,\" she said.\r\n\r\n...the article makes it sound like congressmen are spending all this extra time relaxing. \"A three-day work week!?\" But in fact, that just means they spend three days sitting around the Capitol building. Being a congressman is about a lot more than that -- in particular, they're supposed to be getting in touch with the people they represent. And staying in touch. And talking to each other. And (sigh) lobbyists. So i don't think this is as outrageous as it sounds.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tupb","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"created_utc":1165427799,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11870-fde02603-796d-4032-9bcb-16c40958ab4d-1566236761"}

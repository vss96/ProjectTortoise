I have a Loggerhead Musk turtle. She's around 25 years old.\r\n\r\nUp until 4 years ago she was kept in a tank way too small for her. It was one of those vertical tanks and she had no place to rest/haul out. 20+ years of treading water.\r\n\r\nWhat's striking is that when I got her and put her in a suitable tank with the right food... she tripled in size! \r\n\r\nI'm simply astounded by how tough these animals are. It's too bad that they are disappearing because we humans are destroying their habitat.","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25492-2c8ce349-403f-446d-9837-9d946dc78db8-1566236767"}

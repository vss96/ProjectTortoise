Give intelligence/non-randomness and half-life. Regardless of how many steps you are removed of the injection, it still exists at some level.\r\n\r\nActually, no one makes that claim.  Evolution is a very random process on the low level, and a very non-random process on the high-level.  Those are totally consistent statements, and both the low-level randomness and the high-level non-randomness are fundamental to how evolution operates.  Ever take a look at a [normal curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_curve)?  That's the nonrandom result of low-level randomness.  Evolution is no different in that respect (though it's of course very different in other senses).\r\n\r\n&gt; At the end, I'm not even arguing for one side or the other. I'm just saying I find that an interesting point that often seems to get glossed over.\r\n\r\nI don't think it gets glossed over.  I think it's a constant point of contention by people who don't understand the theory of evolution.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx5n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166990122,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48866-f325c6c7-46b1-49d5-ba0c-0a59b3a3efda-1566236777"}

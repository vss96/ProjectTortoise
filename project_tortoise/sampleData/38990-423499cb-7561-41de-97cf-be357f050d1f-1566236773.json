The video recording doesn't appear to have captured a rape, since the report mentions she was 'severly intoxicated' on video but nothing about a rape on video. And while most women who report a rape are telling the truth, *not all are*.\r\n\r\nSecondly, even if there was a rape you don't even know that he was a bystander or that he even knew about it - he could have been in the bathroom or outside or somewhere else at the time.\r\n\r\nThirdly it's essential the court system sentences someone for what they do, not who they are. If someone is convicted of X but cleared of Y, the judge sentence for X, according to guidelines and mitigating/prolonging factors on crime X alone. The judge does not base any of his/her sentence on the involvement you think they had in Y, because the jury has cleared them of it.\r\n\r\nSo whether he stood by when the 17 year old was allegedly assulted is irrelevant - there's another charge if the police think he did that.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vd0x","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":16,"score":16,"created_utc":1166555337,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38990-423499cb-7561-41de-97cf-be357f050d1f-1566236773"}

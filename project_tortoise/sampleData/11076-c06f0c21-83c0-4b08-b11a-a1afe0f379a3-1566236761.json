Note the article does not claim that a bigger gap is always a healthier gap.\r\n\r\nThe gap *this* article is talking about is not caused by individuals in society being more talented than others. It's caused by problems that are preventing people from working productively, and preventing people from benifiting from their work.\r\n\r\nPaul Grahem is not talking about people who were born into a debt where the country can't even manage the interest payments after a corrupt government borrowed a large sum of money in their name and pocketed it instead of building infrastructure and providing education, for example.\r\n\r\nPG also lives in the intellectual property world where all weath is *created*, but most wealth in the real world is not like this. \r\n\r\nSome wealth is entirely given to us by \"Daddy\" (land, oil reserves, natural resources), but most wealth is a combination of what daddy gave us and what someone did with it. \r\n\r\nBecause it's efficient, we give the wealth that Daddy gave us to the rich as well, by allocating it to the highest bidder - even though no amount of talent and productivity could create it.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807878,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctq6t","id":"ctt6l","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"TheCookieMonster","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11076-c06f0c21-83c0-4b08-b11a-a1afe0f379a3-1566236761"}

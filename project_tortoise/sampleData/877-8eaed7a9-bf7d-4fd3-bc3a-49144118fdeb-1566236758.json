{"controversiality":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you're trying to get at with your pile of stones thing.  To one man, a pile may be any stacking of stones.  Another might define a pile as any grouping of stones, stacked or not.  Another may have some arbitrary definition where a certain number of stones must be stacked together before it is a pile.  A final viewer may have no set definition at all and just choose by their feelings on the subject.\r\n\r\nI wasn't trying to imply that any of my Random's situations were okay.

Iran is threatening the same thing.  You see the other level here?\r\n\r\nThe engineered fall of the dollar is to keep it in the control of the US/Fed not outsiders like Iraq, EU or China.  Yes China pegged to the dollar but they also artificially keep their currency way down, this is negatively affecting us.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think that all lawmakers and economic policy should keep a positive cash flow as the second duty behind protecting the Constitution.  \r\n\r\nBut this spend beyond our limits has helped to keep the currency at a high rate.  Bringing it down like this is only very very risky. Not keeping it high will make foreign investors of course go other places, engineering a downfall.  The Fed better reverse direction.","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26192-7c98f0ea-422b-4a66-92dc-8b6711e91986-1566236767"}

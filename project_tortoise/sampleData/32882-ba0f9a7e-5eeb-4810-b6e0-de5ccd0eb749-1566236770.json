NPCs and levels with player-readable, *player-modifiable* code, that would come into effect for every user immediately upon saving, and would have an editor within the game, which, I imagine, would work a bit like a Wiki. There would have to be some sort of a code revisioning system that would not let you check the source back in until it was a valid, conforming program, of course.\r\n\r\nIf they were to let just *anyone* change the code, however, they'd have to hold back on any looping (recursive or iterative) constructs in the user-code language, unless they could somehow get the code validator to solve the Halting problem.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166308354,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t1_cv1hm","id":"cv22y","edited":false,"author":"derefr","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808719,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32882-ba0f9a7e-5eeb-4810-b6e0-de5ccd0eb749-1566236770"}

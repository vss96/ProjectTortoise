{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ti9j","body":"Cuba has **always** had the olive branch available to the USA. The US has never ever wanted it. In the past 50 years they have conducted at least 638 known anti-Cuba plots, many off which are assassination attempts on Castro. The USA trained and now shelters terrorists guilty of blowing three Cuba passenger airlines. They tried to get John F Kennedy to agree to a plot to shoot down a *US* airliner to justify an invasion of Cuba (much like 9/11 was later used to enact existing plans to conquer Iraq). They also blow up hotels in a bid to discourage European tourism to Cuba. Americans are forbidden from visiting the country.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Cuba has never attacked back. They would be perfectly justified in attempting to assassinate an American leader given how they have been treated.\r\n\r\nAnd their original sin? They threw out a bunch of corrupt businessmen who had immorally sold the countries national assets to another country for essentially firewater and blankets.","controversiality":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1165240667,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctiya","id":"ctjvg","author_flair_text":null,"author":"BraveSirRobin","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807704,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6523-609b21ac-ea81-41ab-8d1a-a7c4db800de6-1566236760"}

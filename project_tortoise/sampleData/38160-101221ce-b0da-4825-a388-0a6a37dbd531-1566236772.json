{"body":"It's consumption that drives the world's economy and the US with its easy credit has traditionally supplied the consumers. That has been possible because of the dollar's status as world reserve currency and 'official' oil trading currency. All those dollars that the US exports find their way back to the Federal Reserve banking system, at least that's how it has happened since about 1975 thanks to the house of Saud.\r\n\r\nToday though, thanks to the house of Bush,  OPEC is turning to the euro for oil trading and the world will slowly but surely turn away from the dollar as the reserve currency. The US is not going to be able to finance that famous consumptive lifestyle. Maybe that will happen next month and maybe in Jan 08' but it will happen. \r\n\r\nNo other nation (China) or group of nations (Europe, greater Asia) are going to be able to step up and supplant the US consumer and the world will feel the repercusions in the form of prolonged recession or worse.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vc4j","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166535582,"author":"borg","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvcfc","id":"cvcmd","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808918,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38160-101221ce-b0da-4825-a388-0a6a37dbd531-1566236772"}

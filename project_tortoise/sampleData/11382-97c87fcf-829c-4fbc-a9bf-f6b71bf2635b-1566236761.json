I came across an article posted here called [Why Marijuana Impairs Memory](http://www.livescience.com/humanbiology/061119_pot_memory.html) and I followed the link at the bottom that said [Up in Smoke: Marijuana Toasts Memory](http://www.livescience.com/humanbiology/060313_pot_brain.html).\r\n\r\nThis article reports on a study by Greek neuroscientists.  They report that:\r\n\r\n&gt;In one memory test, long-time uses remembered seven of 15 words, on average. Non-users remembered 12 of 15. On a decision-making test, those who had rarely smoked pot had impaired performance 8 percent of time, while long-term tokers had 70 percent impairment.\r\n\r\nSounds scary.  But if you look closer, you'll find that the entire group of subjects consisted of only 64 people.  The study can be found [here](http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/5/737).  You can find some of the study results [here](http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/full/66/5/737/DC1).\r\n\r\nYou'll see that the study examined \"20 long-term, 20 shorter term heavy frequent cannabis users, and 24 controls\".  Is that really broad enough to make this claim definitively?\r\n\r\nThere have been so many negative studies about marijuana that have subsequently been shown to be false that I'm just not convinced.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807893,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cttzo","parent_id":"t1_ctt2m","edited":false,"author":"adrian","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11382-97c87fcf-829c-4fbc-a9bf-f6b71bf2635b-1566236761"}

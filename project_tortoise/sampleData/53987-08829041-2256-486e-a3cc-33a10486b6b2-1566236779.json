I'd rather burn it!\r\n\r\nI may not be inhabiting my hypothetical cadaver, but it's still mine in the same way as my house and my car: it's mine to divide up in the will, for the benefit of my loved ones. To that end, asking a price for organs reflects my intent to add money into my estate, and not blocking me from doing this incentivizes me to provide organs, rather than eg: choosing to be buried intact.\r\n\r\nYou're also ignoring the \"invisible hand\". People who need a thing most urgently will be prepared to offer more. Charity will be targeted at the needy and poor. Organs in short supply will fetch higher prices and incentivize sales. Cumulative result: a supply-demand priority queue driven by individual preference decisions rather than some voice-from-on-high committee, or worse, a cold-blooded FIFO.","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"53987-08829041-2256-486e-a3cc-33a10486b6b2-1566236779"}

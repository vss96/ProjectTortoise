If you intend to litigate, destroying evidence isn't in your best interest. Honestly, the school and the Aid put themselves in harm's way by NOT complying with the parents request.\r\n\r\nNow the parents can say, \"The original record shows that the Aid reported 'inappropriate SEXUAL contact' which the school administers changed to 'inappropriate physical contact'. They are obviously covering something up.\" The school and the aid have set themselves up to be jailed and sued. If they would have just dropped the whole thing, the parents wouldn't have complained to the news and no one would know about it.\r\n\r\nTHAT is what should have happened, even with the current \"system.\" (I agree the system is obviously broken, but there is still enough wiggle room... for now.)\r\n\r\nAnd for the record, I still blame the Aid. She could have just not hugged that kid again if she felt he nuzzled too much. Instead, she decided to make a big freaking stink about it. I hope she ends up with a sex offender record.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ucm2","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21444-6d61f141-ba45-43ba-89c9-fe3bc015bb62-1566236765"}

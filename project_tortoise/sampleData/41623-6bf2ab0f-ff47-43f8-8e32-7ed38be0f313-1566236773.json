But it's not the Air Force's fault. I have been out of the military for almost ten years and it's not any easier with or without Uncle Sam signing your paycheck. To be truthful, it's actually easier to go to school when you serve overseas, because there are usually extension Universities on base. Stateside Universities and Colleges are simply focused on keeping the barrier of completion high. I will not comment on whether this is done out of enlightenment or malice.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166644743,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41623-6bf2ab0f-ff47-43f8-8e32-7ed38be0f313-1566236773"}

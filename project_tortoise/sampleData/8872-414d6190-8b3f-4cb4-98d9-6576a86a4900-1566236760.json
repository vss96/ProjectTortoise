{"body":"&gt;Are you aware of any heavyweights he's turned down?\r\n\r\nNo, but all the same I have never seen him debate any serious theologian worth his salt (I did see the Archbishop of York - they were both weak), and his stunt at Liberty University looked a lot like him sinking to debating with creationists.\r\n\r\n&gt;this is Huston Smith the Tim Leary follower, who disapproves of mainstream medicine and universities? interesting, possibly, but 'intellectual heavyweight' is a bit strong.\r\n\r\nI take it you are unfamiliar with Smith's position in the realm of comparative religion.  You might want to familiarize yourself a bit before you embarrass yourself again.  While Smith was a friend of Leary's in the 50s, and participated in some of his early experiments, that does not make him a Leary follower as such, nor does it make him an intellectual lightweight to participate in a Harvard study.  As for what you take to be his criticism of mainstream medicine and universities, are you thinking of his description of the problem with institutions or something else?  If it is, do you seriously imagine that criticizing the AMA is the same as disapproving of mainstream medicine?  If something else, please cite.  As for criticizing universities, he has been a prof. at MIT, Syracuse, and Berkeley, I'd say he has a right to recognize some faults if anyone does.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tivn","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165326785,"ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_ctoua","edited":false,"id":"ctox2","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807798,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8872-414d6190-8b3f-4cb4-98d9-6576a86a4900-1566236760"}

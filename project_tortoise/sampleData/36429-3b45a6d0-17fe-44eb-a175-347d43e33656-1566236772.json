{"controversiality":1,"body":"School is not supposed to teach you how to become wealthy. Civilizations are designed so that, globally, kids of powerful people become powerful people themselves, and in a capitalist system, power/wealth correlation is close to 1.  Therefore, it's wealthy parents' job to teach the path to wealth.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen even in European countries with no tuition fees: parents' wealth is not an issue to be accepted in the best schools, but:\r\n\r\n* knowing how to get there requires a lot of know-how, mostly held by socially upper classes;\r\n\r\n* there are lesser, private, expensive universities, so that if you're wealthy but your kids aren't gifted, they can still get a decent education by buying it.","link_id":"t3_v7vw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166468630,"score":-2,"ups":-2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"fab13n","parent_id":"t3_v7vw","id":"cv92o","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808851,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36429-3b45a6d0-17fe-44eb-a175-347d43e33656-1566236772"}

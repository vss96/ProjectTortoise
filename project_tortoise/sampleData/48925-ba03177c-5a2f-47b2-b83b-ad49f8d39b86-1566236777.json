The reason that people used the term \"Corporate Welfare\" was to imply a different meaning than reality.\r\n\r\nThis is a very similar situation to using the term pro-life instead of anti-choice.  Labelling it as semantics doesn't invalidate it.\r\n\r\nThe thing about the AT&amp;T phone lines is that they still OWN it.  We paid for it, AT&amp;T laid it, and the competitors had to fight to be able to lease them from AT&amp;T.  We still pay to lease them ourselves even though we paid for them via taxes.  I'd consider that corporate welfare a lot quicker than the given article's example.\r\n\r\nIf you pay for someone to lay out wiring, who should own it?  The one you paid to do it?  No, the one who paid for it should own it.  That wasn't a tax break either.  We paid for 50 years a tax on each phone line specifically that went to a fund to cover the installation of wiring around the country. We paid for it. We should own it.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166992089,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvukh","id":"cvxsj","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nosoupforyou","retrieved_on":1473809325,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48925-ba03177c-5a2f-47b2-b83b-ad49f8d39b86-1566236777"}

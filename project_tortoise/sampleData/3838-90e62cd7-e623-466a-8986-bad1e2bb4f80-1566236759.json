It makes sense that a system be put in place whereby prescriptions can be submitted electronically--or at least typed and printed.  That would definitely lessen the likelihood of this type of misunderstanding.  But whatever the mode of communication, there is always the possiblity that *some* misunderstandings or miscommunications will occur.  So a person not taking more than a passive interest in something that could affect their health seems just as asinine.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm actually going to retract my above conclusion.  In the same way that I would blame a cashier who miscalculated the amount of change I was due (or perhaps more fittingly, who misread it from the screen on the register), the doctor and pharmacist are largely to blame in this situation.  It is their professional responsibility to do everything in their ability to care for the patient as best they can, and failing in that respect due to laziness, carelessness or some combination thereof is not excusable.","controversiality":0,"score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165095403,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3838-90e62cd7-e623-466a-8986-bad1e2bb4f80-1566236759"}

I use the OS X port of VLC rather than Quicktime, and (although it actually is quite pretty) I really couldn't care less what it looked like. As a media player, I spend most of my time with it maximized and invisible.\n\nWhereas with something like a text editor, a much greater proportion of the *experience of using it* is wrapped up in how tightly it integrates with the OS. Just as an example, Textmate doesn't have a built-in FTP client, since there are programs like Cyberduck and Transmit that provide for that with an \"Edit Using...\" feature. The OS supports that relationship between the applications, so it's a logical design.\n\nOn Windows, on the other hand, the best editors have SVN/FTP/SSH support baked right into them, so there's no \"second app\" involved.\n\nObviously a port is better than nothing. I'm glad to have Inkscape on my Mac, even if it's running through the ass-tastic X11. But you can't undermine the importance of a UI designer sitting down and carefully tuning an interface to the expectations of users on a given platform.\n\nTo be fair, though, the most discerning users are probably on the Mac, and this API seems to suggest a workflow of developing for OS X first, and then having the option to compile a Windows binary.","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46397-c93cdc55-d0b6-4016-a40a-ee14d364a037-1566236775"}

{"body":"This could possibly warrant a reexamination of ALH84001 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALH84001 - the meteorite that Dr. David McKay claimed contained possible fossils from Mars. \r\n\r\nOne of the principal critiques of the claim was the size of the claimed fossil structures. As the Wikipedia article notes, the structures in the meteorite are 20-100 nanometres in size, smaller even than these newly found archaea.\r\n\r\nSo this discovery doesn't quite provide supporting evidence for McKay's claim, it does point out that we still have more to learn about the spectrum of possible sizes for life.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vwkl","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166998384,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"DeafScribe","parent_id":"t3_vwkl","id":"cvxzw","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809330,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49053-1fe96768-0ebb-4d04-8b16-55ffff821d09-1566236777"}

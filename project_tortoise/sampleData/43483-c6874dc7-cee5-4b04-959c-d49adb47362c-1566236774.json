Tycho may have poisoned himself by imbibing some medicine containing unintentional mercuric chloride impurities. Some have even speculated that Tycho may have been murdered, possibly by Kepler[3] - though there is no specific evidence implicating Kepler. Yet another theory is that he was treating his syphilis with mercury leading to an overdose[citation needed]. Critics of the mercury theory point to the fact that Isaac Newton's hair had many times the mercury level of Brahe's but that there is no reputable suggestion that Newton died of mercury poisoning, and also to the present lack of particular evidence of mercury poisoning on or before the October 13, 1601, banquet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe)\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vkko","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43483-c6874dc7-cee5-4b04-959c-d49adb47362c-1566236774"}

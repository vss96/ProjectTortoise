Why are the researchers aware of these findings never living in small rural villages in the South American jungle? When I ask some piss poor and hungry Africans if they want to come to America, they rarely say: \"No thanks, I think I am happier here!\"\r\n\r\nOfcourse those are extremes. A sustainable small scale healthy community is theoretically possible. I've read E.F. Schumacher's Small Is Beautiful and David Ehrenfelds books. They both make valid points. However, I do think there is an inate human desire to invent \"stuff\" that makes life easier/better/different. Unfortunately, side-effects of such innovations are not always known in advance (see: externalization). But the many disadvantages that come from human progress (a debatable word in this context) do not imply we should just disregard innovation alltogether and go back to a sustainable equilibrium. As long as there's a chance of a better future, somebody, somewhere, will try and create it; hostile space or not.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t2bj","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"355-bfc1a9a4-8fab-415d-b4f4-a0b3c3433a66-1566236758"}

That makes errors like using InchesToMeters() when you meant MetersToInches less likely.\r\n\r\nThe second, and far more interesting, is that of type safety. Consider this code...\r\n\r\n    areaOfCircle = 2 * pi * radius\r\n\r\nTo any human one looking at that, it is obvious that there is an error and the correct code is pi * radius * radius. However, there is no way for the compiler to catch it.\r\n\r\nIf areaOfCircle was typed as an Area and radius as a Length, then it would be a compiler error. For while the multiplication operator for Length and another Length is an Area, the multiplication operator for Length and a scalar is only another Length.\r\n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165541216,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":4,"score":4,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t1_cu22w","id":"cu260","edited":false,"author":"grauenwolf","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808045,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15039-799f45e5-f2b9-48f1-9ae1-806f5ffc6fab-1566236762"}

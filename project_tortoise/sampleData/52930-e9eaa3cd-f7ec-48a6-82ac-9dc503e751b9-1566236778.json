The issue is that Erlang should have used statement terminators in some places instead of expression separators everywhere. The problem with expression separators is they vary context to context, so a little snippet of code moved around often need separators changed to match the context. This makes refactoring code much more cumbersome than in C languages, which generally gets it right.\r\n\r\nIt's not that big of deal, the syntax stuff doesn't cause bugs or make the code harder to read, its just a nuisance during maintenance.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52930-e9eaa3cd-f7ec-48a6-82ac-9dc503e751b9-1566236778"}

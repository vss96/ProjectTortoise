If only I had been able to get iodine crystals.  It said in the directions that you could sometimes obtain them from a drugstore, but I was afraid I'd get in trouble if I asked for them. Not of getting arrested, but of having the pharmacist tell my parents, who then would want to know why I wanted such an exotic substance.\r\n\r\nI blew up lots of other things, but never the elusive Nitrogen Triiodide, though my numerous attempts to concoct it represented the beginning of my investigation into the curiousities of chemistry and the physical sciences, an endeavor which eventually led to my transformation from callow incompetent bomb-maker to a productive member of society.\r\n\r\nIf I were growing up today I'd probably end up a fascist brownshirt, or maybe a grief counselor\r\n\r\nThis \"terrorism\" thing has gone much to far.","link_id":"t3_u5p4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18677-ee30d747-a4cb-4ea6-8c64-9f496509f4cb-1566236764"}

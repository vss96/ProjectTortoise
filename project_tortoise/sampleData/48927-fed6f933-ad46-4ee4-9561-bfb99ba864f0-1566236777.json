They won't elect to put their kids in the school that has the best football or basketball team?\r\n\r\nWhere are we going to get all these good teachers? If 10% of the schools are \"good\", and everyone wants to send kids to them, there aren't enough desks. The \"bad\" schools go under, the good schools expand... but in doing so, need to hire ever more marginal teachers. Until they themselves are no longer \"good\".\r\n\r\nThe government is bad at education, and one needs to be suspicious of its ulterior motives for wanting a monopoly on this. But corporations are hardly the core of wisdom and enlightened concern that I'd turn my kids over to. Even after eliminating the *Enron*s of the world, what we're left with is minimally competent profit-mongering sociopathic institutions.\r\n\r\nWill they decide that the return on investment to make my kid 9% more educated simply costs too much, that the shareholders wouldn't be served?\r\n\r\nWe are talking about the same kind of companies, after all, that think that it's acceptable to give me 6megabit DOCSIS over 25 year old coax for $70 a month, while the rest of the world gets 100megabit fiber for a fraction of the cost.\r\n\r\nDo what you can to get a job where you can work from home enough to teach your kids yourself. Maybe you'll learn something too.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809325,"gilded":0,"id":"cvxsl","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vxqd","author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48927-fed6f933-ad46-4ee4-9561-bfb99ba864f0-1566236777"}

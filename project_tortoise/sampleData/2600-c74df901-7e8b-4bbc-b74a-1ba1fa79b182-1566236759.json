If you are drunk off your ass at 3:00 am and want a (crappy) steak and (rubbery) scrambled eggs, where else can you go?\r\n\r\nI just really hate Taco Bell though.  Try eating the stuff without any sauce one of these days, you'll see how horrible the stuff is.  I used to think I didn't like Mexican food, but then when I went to California I ate at real Mexican restaurants where nobody even spoke English, and that is when I found out that I actually like the stuff.  Half of the menu at Taco Bell doesn't even remotely resemble what it is called.  Real chalupas are really good.  Taco Bell's chalupas are basically just yet another taco.","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2600-c74df901-7e8b-4bbc-b74a-1ba1fa79b182-1566236759"}

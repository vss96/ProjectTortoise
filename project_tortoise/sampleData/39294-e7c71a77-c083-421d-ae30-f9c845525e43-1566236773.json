Search \"world coal reserves\" in Google. China needs energy that is true. This is why it buys oil-companies with the dollars it gets from US. Westinghouse won recently China nuclear reactor bid. There will be **massive** amounts of nuclear power in china. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.09/china.html\r\n*Late last year, China announced plans to build 30 new reactors - enough to generate twice the capacity of the gargantuan Three Gorges Dam - by 2020. And even that won't be enough. The Future of Nuclear Power, a 2003 study by a blue-ribbon commission headed by former CIA director John Deutch, concludes that by 2050 the PRC could require the equivalent of 200 full-scale nuke plants. A team of Chinese scientists advising the Beijing leadership puts the figure even higher: 300 gigawatts of nuclear output, not much less than the 350 gigawatts produced worldwide today.*\r\n\r\n2) This point has some merit. \r\n\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808959,"gilded":0,"id":"cveqs","parent_id":"t1_cvdor","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39294-e7c71a77-c083-421d-ae30-f9c845525e43-1566236773"}

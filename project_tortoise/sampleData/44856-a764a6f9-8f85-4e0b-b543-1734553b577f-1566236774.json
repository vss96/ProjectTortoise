He follows that sentence with talk of e-commerce, so perhaps he means that there needs to be a way to verify that a user controls certain funds, or a credit card, which would be easier.  If you're not willing to accept control of ID as proof of who someone is, what *are* you willing to accept?  This isn't to say that IDs can't be stolen, only that it's not clear to me that there is a better way even in principle.  \r\n\r\nThe other major problem I have with his proposed requirements is that it implies a central ID authority, which is one of the things OpenID avoids by design.  With OpenID, there's no central point of attack at which one could subvert all ID records, only places with some small portion of OpenID records, which seems like a big win.\r\n\r\nThe only major issue I see with OpenID as it stands today is the possibility of cross-site scripting attacks.\r\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166758033,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t3_vpc5","id":"cvpoi","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"randallsquared","retrieved_on":1473809172,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44856-a764a6f9-8f85-4e0b-b543-1734553b577f-1566236774"}

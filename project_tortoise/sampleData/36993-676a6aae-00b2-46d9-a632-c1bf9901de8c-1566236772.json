In 1997, the latest year for which we have figures, 77 million Americans had tried drugs. Roughly half of all high school seniors have tried drugs by the time they graduate.\r\n\r\nIn what convoluted way can this be evidence that legalization boosts drug use? In fact, it lends support to the position that the War on Drugs *increases* drug use.\r\n\r\nYet another example that the War on Drugs is conceived and executed by idiots barely capable of operating the guns they use to carry out their agenda. In fact, they're so intellectually lazy, fat and happy with their position of power, that they seem to believe that they can just give whatever justifications they want for their assault on civil liberties and we'll just roll over for it.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_v81w","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808871,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoFixedAbode","id":"cva44","parent_id":"t1_cv84d","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36993-676a6aae-00b2-46d9-a632-c1bf9901de8c-1566236772"}

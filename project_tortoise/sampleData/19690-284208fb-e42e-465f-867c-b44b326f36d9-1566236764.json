It's his **job** to help Democrats get elected.\r\n\r\nWithout liberal blogs, netroots organizations like Move On, and Howard Dean chairing the DNC, we definitely wouldn't have a Democratic Senate, and we might not have even taken the House.\r\n\r\nSome Democrats are thrilled to be part of an internet-mediated grassroots movement.  I guess others are threatened by the idea of change.\r\n\r\nBut journalists?  What journalists think about netroot blogs matters less than a fart.  Email me when Judith Miller, Robert Novak, Jeff Gannon, and Tom Friedman have issued apologies and resigned.

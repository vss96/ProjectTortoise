Ive lived in cities where the bus service was done by the government, and ones where the bus service was done by a corporation. In the later, I have no right whatsoever, to challenge the busdriver when he stops for 10 minutes to wait for his friend at a particular stop. He would just kick me off the bus. When I was where the government ran it, they had to act better because I, as a tax payer, was paying their salary. At the very least I could throw that in their face. What power did I have when it was run by a corportation? The power of depriving them of my one fare?\r\n\r\nOften times, the buses do not even make all the stops, as some are judged to be in too infrequent use. If it was a government service, they would have to provide coverage.\r\n\r\nNow thats one example. The problem in america is that the people do not see themselves as part of the government. In other countries, I am not fighting against the government, I elected them and they are my servents. Good luck EVER convincing a corporation that they should be serving you. Good luck trying to convince a corporation that they are obliged to do something for you or owe you something. They would just tell you to take your business elsewhere, which in the case of my busses, would mean walking.","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166230221,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cuzej","parent_id":"t3_uz1h","edited":false,"author":"degustixmassled","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808668,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31785-a6a2dc4e-cc2c-4e5b-9f69-2c5d4ee1d1f4-1566236770"}

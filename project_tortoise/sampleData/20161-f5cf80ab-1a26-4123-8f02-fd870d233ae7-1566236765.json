The Russians were to be segregated from the Germans, and eventually physically replaced.  There was no intention of making them German.\r\n\r\nIt would have taken a long time to do so, because Germany would have needed 100-200 million more people, and that takes time.  Also, it's questionable whether Germans would have wanted to go be farmers in the Ukraine, and whether German women would have cooperated and been baby factories instead of becoming infertile, as they are now.\r\n\r\nThese problems could be solved by a ruthless dictator - force women to have babies, force people to move to the East.  But it's possible that the Germans would have become addicted to slave labor and an easy life in Germany, and just not carried out their original plans.  Especially since Hitler would have been lucky to see 1960, given his poor health.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165762345,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cubu1","parent_id":"t1_cubry","author":"lysine23","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808226,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20161-f5cf80ab-1a26-4123-8f02-fd870d233ae7-1566236765"}

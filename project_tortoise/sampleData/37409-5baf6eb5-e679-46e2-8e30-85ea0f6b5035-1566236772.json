This is what I use. The tabbed browsing in it works just fine and I can't think of any better way it could be done. The only plugin I use is Flash and Tor. The Tor plugin was a snap to add in, and Flash came with Swiftfox by default because it \"steals\" the Firefox plugins.\r\n\r\nAlso, web developers make their pages these days either work for Internet Exploder or Firefox. They rarely work on making things look great in Safari or Opera. Why would I want to switch to a browser where half the websites won't work on it?\r\n\r\nYes, I tried Opera back on Windows back in the old days when I still used Windows. I tried to like it although it didn't work well with 40% of the websites I went to. However, I enjoyed its tabbed browsing. But when Firefox came out, and it had the Mozilla name, and public support rallied behind it, I couldn't care less about Opera. And then when I switched from Windows to Linux (now on Ubuntu Linux, of course), I continue to use Firefox.\r\n\r\nThe makers of Opera just need to focus on something else. They've lost the browser wars. The only place where they might make a dent is in the vertical application market such as with mobile phones, medical equipment, media appliances, etc. And to gain marketshare there, they simply need to make many things easily customized with simple development.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808887,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv7o4","id":"cvaxt","author":"supermike","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37409-5baf6eb5-e679-46e2-8e30-85ea0f6b5035-1566236772"}

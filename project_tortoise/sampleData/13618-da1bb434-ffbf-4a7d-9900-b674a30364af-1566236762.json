If it works for their individual problem domain them it must of course work for everybody no matter how different their problem domain is.\r\n\r\nThe other thing mentioned is STM (software transactional memory).  It has a couple of nice features, one of which is deadlock freedom.  That part is particularly useful especially if you have a badly designed api with callbacks all over the place and not so thread saavy programmers.  The big problem with STM is scalability.  Scalability is an important property of concurrent programs.  There is no point in using multi-threading if it doesn't perform better than a single threaded program.  Current implementations of STM are only \"obstruction-free\".  Under high contention, some threads may  never make any forward progress which could be a bad thing.","created_utc":1165495006,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13618-da1bb434-ffbf-4a7d-9900-b674a30364af-1566236762"}

{"body":"A comment from the author\r\n \r\n1. Yes my spelling sucks. I'm Swiss and believe me I'm doing my best. So please focus on what I say and be a little more relaxed with small mistakes. I know spelling errors and missing words make me look bad but I just have a real hard time spotting those, because my eyes are trained for German text. Yet I do appreciate people pointing out those mistakes to me.\r\n2. My coding sucks too, because I'm not a programmer and yet as a company owner I'm constantly experimenting to find the best solution for the user (instead of winning WC3 compliant prices). My programmers do that for our customers though... And they actually appreciate me doing what I do even though they often frown upon my code...\r\n2. We all know that we can adjust the font size with a key combination, but we don't want to.\r\n3. Column width: I tried all suggestions made here - thanks a lot beza 1e1 - and went back to 50% column width with the 32 em addition.\r\n4. Horizontal scrolling was due to the picture size.\r\n5. People complaining that the line width gets too small when bumping the font 2 or 3 sizes UP are my kind of 0.1% of people. I'll try hard to satisfy them as good as I can.\r\n6. Really appreciate the input\r\n\r\nAh yes: And scrolling is NOT bad. Flipping pages in a book is not bad either, btw.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tjeu","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165277225,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"infoarchitect","parent_id":"t3_tjeu","edited":false,"id":"ctmor","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807756,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7889-5b9baf77-ee1e-4203-ba7f-312ac5fc6828-1566236760"}

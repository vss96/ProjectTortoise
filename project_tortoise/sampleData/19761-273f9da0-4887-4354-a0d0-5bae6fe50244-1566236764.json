However, when I was a kid, and at church -- or at church events, where myself and other kids spoke in unison (i.e along the lines of: \"Jesus, we all promise that... etc\") at no point did I speak those words and not already believe them. Just imagine what would happen if the speaker said to that group of kids \"Hey everyone repeat after me, There is no God. We will be atheists all our lives. \" --- Do you honestly believe the kids would repeat this just because the adult said it? Further, assuming a kid says the words and doesn't really believe them, then its not like they will suddenly instantly believe them as soon as its said.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ua04","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19761-273f9da0-4887-4354-a0d0-5bae6fe50244-1566236764"}

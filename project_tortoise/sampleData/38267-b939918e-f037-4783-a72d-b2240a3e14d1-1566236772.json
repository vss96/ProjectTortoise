A classical aim of terrorism is to force your opponent to behave in the way that matches your propaganda about them. ‘America is the Great Satan, they hate all Moslems, do you want proof, look they have invaded 2 Moslem countries and reduced them to anarchy.’ Or ‘The Great Satan is evil and hates all Moslems, look they are have made it the law to torture your brothers.’\r\n\r\nNow that might not be quite how Americans see it, but boy are a lot of the next generation in the middle-east going to grow up believing it, and they now have the evidence in front of them. Not really very helpful at all if you want something other than endless rolling conflict. \r\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166538792,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_v9pw","edited":false,"id":"cvcv1","author_flair_text":null,"author":"buildmonkey","retrieved_on":1473808922,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38267-b939918e-f037-4783-a72d-b2240a3e14d1-1566236772"}

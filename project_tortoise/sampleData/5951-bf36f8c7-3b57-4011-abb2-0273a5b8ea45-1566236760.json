I've lived in the Gulf states. They have a considerable population of displaced Palestinians living and working there, so they sympathize with them a lot and resent Israeli policies. Most Gulf Arabs had never *knowingly* met a Jew. In my experience Jews are just not on their mind. They worry more about an Iranian takeover of the Gulf states and are more suspicious of the Shiites amongst them. \r\nIn the scheme of things though Jews are actually at quite an elevated position in the Arab mind. There's no comparison between the status of Jews and, for example, the Hindus to the Arabs. It might be that the Hindu beliefs and practices are just so alien to them and so easily misunderstood. Yet there are so many Hindu workers in the Gulf states, many of them are actually doing quite well, and it doesn't seem to be something the Arabs think of much.","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"5951-bf36f8c7-3b57-4011-abb2-0273a5b8ea45-1566236760"}

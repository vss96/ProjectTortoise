The same moral hazard that causes fathers to ditch support or keep low-paying jobs to prevent having to pay more support exists with mothers in spending the support they receive.\r\n\r\nYes, they don't **need** an XBOX 360, but that doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't get one for them.  I bought one for myself, and I think it's a perfectly justifiable means of spending my money.  I wouldn't have a problem buying \"unnecessary\" things for my kids.  It's not always materialism.\r\n\r\nBut, having it go to the mother's car is awful.  Best solution is to figure out, like you say, exact \"living costs\" and let you get the gifts all on your own (this also avoids mom \"buying\" the XBOX 360 for the kids when it's your money she's spending.","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1165458589,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctxeb","parent_id":"t1_ctwq9","author_flair_text":null,"author":"duketime","retrieved_on":1473807956,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12983-b0977abe-930c-4126-a243-aaeb281e9cba-1566236762"}

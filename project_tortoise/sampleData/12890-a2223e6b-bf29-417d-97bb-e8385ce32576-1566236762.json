Most Slasdotters gravitated to Digg and PG readers wound up here, which gave Reddit an initial leg up in the average un-sophomoric nature of its user :)\r\nBut continued fame means that a wider demographic is attracted, making the site less attractive for any single cluster. Of course, that shouldn't be a problem if the recommendation page is good enough that people can forsake the landing page entirely, but that is far away or another budding startup, but till then we, the current users, need to set up some high barriers to entry here.\r\n\r\nReddit is going to be plagued by the same problem unless we continue to be merciless in downvoting any puerile or merely non-informative comments. \r\n\r\n* Downvote any comments with too many/much {exclamation marks, question marks, capitalization, leet speak}\r\n\r\n* Condescend to anyone who simply applauds submissions but adds nothing informative.\r\n\r\n* Keep an eye out for recurring hot articles. An increasing frequency suggest that the reader base is swelling pretty rapidly. We don't want that! (Ok, no more exclamations) In such a case we shouldn't just downovote, but report the submission.\r\n\r\n* Report any blogspot, wordpress, infogami, googlepages article because that just allows every expert poseur to air his airhead opinions.\r\n\r\n* In general, make this an intimidating place for new users who aren't compelled to treat submission and commentary as right they should respect.\r\n\r\n* I suggest spamming Reddit inboxes of those you believe are undeserving of Reddit accounts.\r\n\r\nGentleman, and the apocryphal ladies of the internet, let the protracted battle for continuing quality begin.\r\n\r\nedit: fixed typos, must not disrespect the collaborative nature of news gathering with a lackadaisical attitude\r\n","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473807951,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_tvsi","id":"ctx6j","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Csai","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12890-a2223e6b-bf29-417d-97bb-e8385ce32576-1566236762"}

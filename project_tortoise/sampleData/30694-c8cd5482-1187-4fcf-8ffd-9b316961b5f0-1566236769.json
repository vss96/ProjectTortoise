{"controversiality":0,"body":"And you parents didn't go ballistic when you failed a class?   Seems to me not the school but they are mostly to blame.  They put you in a bad situation, they didn't help you at all cope with it.  They had no idea whatw as going on in your life.  This is just basic neglect, dumping the kid to the school and let them deal with it.  Schools require parental oversight to work well.\r\n\r\nBeing involved in your kids life is the difference not the homeschooling.","link_id":"t3_ut1n","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166199255,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"tekumse","id":"cux8i","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuwdx","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808628,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30694-c8cd5482-1187-4fcf-8ffd-9b316961b5f0-1566236769"}

I'm not talking about the usual suspects like \"car\", \"cdr\" and \"cons\", which I don't have a problem with. \r\n\r\nI'm talking about the fact that predicates always have \"p\" on the end, except when they're \"null\" or \"atom\". \r\n\r\nI'm talking about how the destructive equivalent of \"reverse\" is \"nreverse\", the destructive equivalent of \"append\" is \"nconc\" and the destructive equivalent of \"sort\" is... \"sort\".\r\n\r\nAnd I'm talking about names that manage to be gratuitously verbose and awkwardly abbreviated at the same time. The function for calling a function could be a nice, short word like \"call\", or it could be longer and more descriptive, like \"call-function\". Instead we get \"funcall\". Or \"makunbound\" instead of \"unbind\". It's clearly better to type 10 stupid-looking characters than 6 perfectly normal ones.\r\n\r\nAlso, using \"t\" as a constant sucks big fat rocks. If I had a nickel for every error I've gotten after typing \"(lambda (t) ...)\" I could fund a new standardization process and change the name to +true+ or even just true....","link_id":"t3_w4aj","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809477,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cw5q5","parent_id":"t3_w4aj","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53123-f7dd54d4-5d07-4ade-b03b-d037badc8f05-1566236778"}

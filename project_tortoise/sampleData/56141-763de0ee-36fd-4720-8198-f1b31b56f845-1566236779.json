This despite it being quicker to go from London to Paris than it is to go from London to Dover.\r\n\r\nI somehow don't see where the relevance of a PRT comes in with cross-country travel. Inner-city it would be great, but when you're talking London-Manchester it's exceptionally wasteful design. If you'd been on the train system in France it's delightfully fast compared to the British system, like you can actually go somewhere without needing to sleep on the train.\r\n\r\nI was on the GO system in the Toronto area, I was amazed by how fast it was and it's considered a snail of a system compared to what's being run elsewhere.\r\n\r\nEngland was the home of the railroad, and it's shameful that our rail system is completely dead when it's a cheap and efficient alternative to air travel. Not to mention it would cut down on the work load in airports, the check-in times and the miracle is that you could run the system on renewable energy or nuclear energy and not have to tax the arses off people flying to try to stop them flying.","link_id":"t3_w8qa","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56141-763de0ee-36fd-4720-8198-f1b31b56f845-1566236779"}

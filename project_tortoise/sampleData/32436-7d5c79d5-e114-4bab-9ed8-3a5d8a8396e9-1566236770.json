And didn't you read about his anti-Muslim speech?\r\n\r\nHe has always been a hardline advocate: “the enforcer”, “the panzer cardinal” and “God’s rottweiler” are his nicknames.\r\n\r\nOh, more about the [institution](http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/effectiveorganization.aspx) that shaped this guy's political views: \"Hitler Youth School's were set-up around the country, to further indoctrinate Youth Leaders, but a \"normal\" education could not be had at these institutions. Instead, they were indoctrinated in Nazism and learned about race, religion, and duty.\" Sounds familiar?\r\n\r\nAh, but it is the past, you say! Surely he didn't agree with the fanaticism, the hatred and the abject devotion to fanatical ideals that the Hitler Youth instilled in its members. Then again, from [Reuters, quoted in truthout](http://www.truthout.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/37/10475):\r\n\"    As John Paul's doctrinal overseer, Ratzinger disciplined Latin American \"liberation theology\" theologians, denounced homosexuality and gay marriage and pressured Asian priests who saw non-Christian religions as part of God's plan for humanity.\r\n    Matt Foreman, of the U.S. National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said: \"Today the princes of the Roman Catholic Church elected as Pope a man whose record has been one of unrelenting, venomous hatred for gay people.\"\r\n    In a document in 2000, Ratzinger branded other Christian churches as deficient -- shocking Anglicans, Lutherans and other Protestants in ecumenical dialogue with Rome for years.\"\r\n\r\nSo, he is not Nazi.

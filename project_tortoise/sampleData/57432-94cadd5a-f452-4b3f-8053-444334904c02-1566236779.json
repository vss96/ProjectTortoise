That was on Dec 15th... i'm still waiting for them to ship the part to the apple store so they can replace the drive.  It's on back-order and apple is apparently very secretive about ship dates for back-ordered parts.\r\n\r\nI love apple's products, but i'm extremely unimpressed by their customer service so far.  15 days to replace a drive is just ridiculous... i find it hard to believe that they have *zero* superdrives in *any* warehouse *anywhere*\r\n\r\nYMMV","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57432-94cadd5a-f452-4b3f-8053-444334904c02-1566236779"}

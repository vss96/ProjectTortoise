That you still do; even after being confronted with the evidence that they are dead wrong- what is that saying about your position on this? That you agree with conclusions based on lies? It's sort of breathtaking that you can claim you don't believe in legitimate authorities and then two sentences later appoint diarists who are dangerously wrong in their analysis and conclusions as such authorities.\r\n\r\nI don't know that there is going to be any intelligent discussion possible with you here, if you can willfully continue to use bad information as the basis for your perspective. And its not merely bad information but obviously wrong as well.\r\n\r\nThe Iranians like any other nation and even the factions within the US have their own agendas. So what? Of course everybody looks out for self interest. That's a given for anyone dealing within anyone else in this world. This is the reality of that thing called diplomacy. Of which you should well be aware.\r\n\r\nThe current neo-con view boils down to the position that Iran is some how an order of magnitude more evil than everyone else, and worse completely irrational. This is clearly not the case based on the limited information supplied in Leverett's redacted text. That's the immediate value of his message. That it show the lie of the current neo-con Bush/Cheney Iran position. The meta-story is the clear demonstration of Bush/Cheney Team knowingly doing wrong to support this completely dishonest and flawed position against the interest of the nation they are serving.\r\n\r\nPower is being able to hold others to their promises, doing this without having to place a gun to someone's head is true power. This is the essence of diplomacy. How you can not know this and be the son of a diplomat is beyond me.\r\n\r\nWhat Iran or Syria or any other nation can offer the US is cooperation and access. Both of which ultimately leave them as the supplicants in the transaction, more susceptible to future demands of US power. Iran was going to voluntarily give us what we wanted before the rise of Ahmadinejad. Rather than attempt to accept this, the US decided it would rather pretend Iran was beneath direct recognition, and in doing so LOST power over Iran. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.\r\n\r\nNow is Iran a monolith of power and action? No. Much like any other country when unpleasant factions gain power they do unpleasant things. The successive government administrations within the US are testament to the variabilities of consequences that occur with the changing of power holders. Are there powers within Iran that need to be brought to justice? You betcha. Do these facts preclude a diplomatic solution? No way.\r\n\r\nIs the point of the article to illustrate how far out the way the Bush/Cheney team is going to sabotage diplomacy? Yes. Is this a disgusting abrogation of the responsibilities of their office? Yes.\r\n\r\nIs the publication of the details of this fight, both in it's surface and meta stories, essential to the American electorate? Yes.\r\n\r\nThat you do not see these points, but instead are continuing to embrace a framework that rests on a bunch of conclusions based on lies and deadly wrong analysis, is profoundly disturbing.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809297,"gilded":0,"id":"cvw8u","parent_id":"t1_cvuww","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"smacfarl","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48171-7545e08e-892a-440b-8139-02301e90ae12-1566236777"}

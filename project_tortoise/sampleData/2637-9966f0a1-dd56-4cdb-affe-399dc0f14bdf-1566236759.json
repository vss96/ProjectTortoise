The Nazis were the ruling party of a very large country for a pretty long time -- they did a *lot* of the stuff that governments do, like collecting taxes, building roads, regulating business, etc. Granted, they also started wars and committed genocide, but the fact that they did a lot of terrible stuff doesn't imply that everything they did was awful. I've used the comparison between the *Volkswagen* and Social Security as a cheap shot, which I really shouldn't do. Godwin's law is a reaction against promiscuous abuse of the Nazi comparison -- you're only right if his counter-meme worked.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ta5q","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165024497,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2637-9966f0a1-dd56-4cdb-affe-399dc0f14bdf-1566236759"}

Let's use it elsewhere!\r\n\r\nFor instance, there are many non-native invasive species in the world today. We could send you out, to kill off animals of this or that species, one at a time. Within a few days, I'm sure you'll be able to eradicate them all.\r\n\r\nBecause if it works for excuses, it will surely work for pest animals... excuses breed far faster than any biological organism.\r\n\r\n&gt;Sure, the other guy's blood will just start working on the damage and he'll be good as new in a week... if you don't hit 'm again. And again. And then, when he's got that look on his face, that thousand yard stare--when he's left his defenses open, and the last excuse is obvious--the uppercut.\r\n\r\nI nominate you to be the international spokesman for atheism. With such an enlightened and gentle analogy, we'll convert the world in no time! And they'll be lucky too, since atheists like yourself are actually gentle and caring, and would never use a metaphor that is pugilistic and bellicose, as some religious people are wont to do.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx8t","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809328,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvxxn","id":"cvxy5","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49031-aa0ff37a-c14e-4826-a805-89d4b586bbc9-1566236777"}

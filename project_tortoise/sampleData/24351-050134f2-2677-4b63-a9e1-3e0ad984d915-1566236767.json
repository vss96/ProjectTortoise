{"body":"Outside of the US, the understanding of what sweetcorn is for varies greatly.  Here in the UK, they put it on all sorts of things...tuna sandwiches, pizza...I'm still not used to it.  When I was in Japan, I had a (not bad) sandwich called a 'vegetarian special California', which was lettuce and sweetcorn with cheese on toasted crustless bread.  Good for when you can't eat another noodle, but not something I order at home, to be sure.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ugkh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165912111,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"cujkd","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuiua","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808373,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24351-050134f2-2677-4b63-a9e1-3e0ad984d915-1566236767"}

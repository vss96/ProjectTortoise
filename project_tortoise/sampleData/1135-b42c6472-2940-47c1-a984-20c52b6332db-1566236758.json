And when idiots like Edroberts make excuses for these treasonist assholes in government. It makes every service man in women who died for the march of freedom roll over in their graves.\r\n\r\nIt easier to be a complete clone and go along with our corrupt government, than to be an American and disagree with our bullshit foreighn and domestic policies. This country is filled with doublethink and speak, always making excuses for poor decision they made at the polls the last few elections.\r\n\r\nThese are the same people who have never or would ever sacrifice their lives for anything greater than themselves. Who have never served this country. Only cowards would make excuses for the treasonous acts performed in this country.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807482,"gilded":0,"id":"ct83f","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct73j","author":"crookedpresident","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1135-b42c6472-2940-47c1-a984-20c52b6332db-1566236758"}

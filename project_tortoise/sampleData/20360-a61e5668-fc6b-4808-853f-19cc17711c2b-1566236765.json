It looks like his bridge moves quite fast: it is going down at the beginning of the video, and quickly goes back up when the ship chimney crashes into it. Definitely more reactive than a big boat with all its inertia. So, the operator should be responsible for ensuring no big, slow, hard to stop ship is headed towards him before lowering the bridge.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ubsw","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1165772565,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20360-a61e5668-fc6b-4808-853f-19cc17711c2b-1566236765"}

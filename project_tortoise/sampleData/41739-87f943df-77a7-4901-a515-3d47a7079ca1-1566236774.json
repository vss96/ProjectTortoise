Yes, the standard seat sizes on planes aren't overly generous, but they are large enough that the vast majority of people can fit into them reasonably comfortably. \r\n\r\nBy attempting to squeeze into a single seat, the obese person spills over into adjacent seats, making the trip extremely uncomfortable to anyone who has the misfortune of sitting next to them.  Before most airlines instituted the extra seat policy, I had this experience many times, and it made for a very unpleasant trip...especially on a 17 hour flight.  If the fat person takes up the space of more than one seat, he should have to buy an extra seat.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vizl","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166647911,"score":53,"ups":53,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41739-87f943df-77a7-4901-a515-3d47a7079ca1-1566236774"}

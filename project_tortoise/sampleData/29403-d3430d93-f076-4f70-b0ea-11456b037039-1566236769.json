This guy doesn't know how to end a book (nevermind the whole middle part...).

Congo was an earthquake/erruption. JP was a firebombing of the island (right?). I don't remember how Sphere ended but I do remember feeling like it was a complete cop out.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166144354,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29403-d3430d93-f076-4f70-b0ea-11456b037039-1566236769"}

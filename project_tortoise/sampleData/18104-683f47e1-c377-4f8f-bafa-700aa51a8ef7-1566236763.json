{"controversiality":1,"body":"&gt; There is also some really cool code in Photoshop's image processing and user interfaces\r\n\r\nC++ for complex user interface logic worked out so well that they now use Lua for all the interface stuff in their new professional photo app Lightroom. 40% of Lightroom is allegedly implemented in Lua. it's now typical to do that in games as well, using Lua for gameplay logic.\r\n\r\n&gt; Indeed, one serious problem is that currently, too many software developers are undereducated and undertrained.\r\n\r\nStupid peasants. You don't deserve to program a computer. If you won't use the STL and \"template metaprogramming\" and live in fear of memory leaks, you are a philistine. Bah. The best language design is one meant to make programming hard.\r\n\r\n&gt; But one aim should be to make tools that will serve skilled professionals--not to lower the level of expressiveness to serve people who can hardly understand the problems, let alone express solutions.\r\n\r\nYes, lowering the level of expressiveness to that of ML or Ruby would be crippling to brilliant programmers. Real men ship software with dozens of buffer overflow vulnerabilities in it.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u5pe","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1165650643,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"schwarzwald","parent_id":"t3_u5pe","id":"cu7sl","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808150,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"18104-683f47e1-c377-4f8f-bafa-700aa51a8ef7-1566236763"}

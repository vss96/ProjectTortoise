Was parked out front of my (rented) house, and would get tickets for some unknown reason. So, I left the sign on the window, and was going to deal with getting whatever permit I needed (though my landlord specified we did not need one to park out front), when, I guess to spite me and my sign, my car was towed. Thing was, I paid $1 for the car, and they wanted in the $300 range to get it out of impound, so I told the tow company to shove it, and keep the car.\r\n\r\nWas a bitch of a situation, now I am a bicycle-only commuter.

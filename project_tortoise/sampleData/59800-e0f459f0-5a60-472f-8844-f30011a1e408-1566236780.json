Fine. \r\n\r\n I say you're a prime candidate for The Party and the Two Minutes Hate. Your doublethink (and everyone of your kind's) is astonishing really.\r\n\r\n First the US invaded Iraq with _clear_ and _undeniable_ evidence that they had stockpiled WMD and were ready to attack US targets any moment. We know where that led.\r\n But the height of your double think is in the fact that we know that *still*, Iran is years off of any completed Nuclear bomb, let alone having something usable on the field (yeah, you think the 50 years and hundreds of nuclear detonation tests all the superpowers conducted was for pleasure?) And the fact that they insist they aren't doing it for war reasons. Besides, this is a small country which would itself quite instantly be anhilated if it ever decided to start a nuclear war of any kind.\r\n\r\nCompound this with the fact that Israel is known to have Nuclear capabilities for decades now and not ever abiding to any international law.\r\n\r\n Yeah, Iran is out to get us. Iran is the big mean bad apple in the batch. It's just on the verge of having ICBMs installed and pointed at washington, and nuclear subs launching undetectable nuclear torpedos at Haifa.","score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1167548292,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59800-e0f459f0-5a60-472f-8844-f30011a1e408-1566236780"}

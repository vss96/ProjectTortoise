(Okay--even when you're in the middle of the psycho-sexual aspect.) Who are the players in this little drama:\r\n\r\n1. A youngish girl, probably more ordinary than \"weak\" or \"cowardly\" though we might be tempted to use those words to describe her, to protect ourselves (for we too are ordinary, yes?) She was, for all intents and purposes, completely in the power of a combination of alleged and official authority: The caller, her manager, and the manager's fiancee.\r\n\r\n2. One 27 year old MCD employee. I'm guessing he doesn't have the most forceful personality or powerful intelligence, given his profession, but he clearly had the brass to refuse the caller. He, however, essentially looked the other way. In reading case studies of group rapes, you will usually find an interesting character: Someone (in the group) who mildly or impotently refuses to participate, and stands aside limply during the crime. The victim, who is otherwise full of painful hatred, generally has a vicious, pleasurable contempt of this individual.\r\n\r\n3. The female manager. A standard type: Having absolutely no understanding of the real basis of authority--the rule of law, the very limited granting of powers to police, etc--she assumes that all power above herself is absolute. Likewise, all power below her stands at zero. You will find this type again and again throughout your life.\r\n\r\n4. The manager's fiancee. While psychologically normal, this person has a sufficient imbalance of animal urges over moral decency, that any excuse, or catalyst, or permission to misbehave is taken up enthusiastically. Some people would never rape a woman; some would rape if they could get away with it; many, many, many more would do so if it became the _correct thing to do_ howsoever falsely. This man is the same type as the soldiers after a siege, raping a city.\r\n\r\n5. The janitor. Here we have a man similar to the 27-year old. It's hard to say from the broadcast, but I picture him as a \"middle finger\" kind of person. (I've known a few janitors, you see.) When he saw what was happening, he knew immediately it was a crime, and was all too ready to call bullshit. Unlike the kid, he knew damn well that the authority vested in the McDonald's manager's fiancee was exactly nothing. And so...the middle finger came out.\r\n\r\n6. The manager's boss. Quite possibly a decent woman. Notice she was off sleeping.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tdn1","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4481-b1814d7c-5941-4c9d-bde9-5fadca635718-1566236759"}

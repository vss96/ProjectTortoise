Rather, the mechanisms required to fully shut marketing activities out would fundamentally compromise the original intent and utility of these site. The Nike “swoosh,” the phrase “stay the course,” MTV “Cribs” and Bono are all part of the public relations and marketing environment, but at the end of the day they are just as powerfully elements of our social and cultural landscape. Furthermore, barring them from social bookmarking sites would be no less “synthetic” than paying a clickfarm (so you’re saying these do exist? Know where I can get in touch with one?) to bump your story to the top of the list.\r\n\r\nHaving said that of course, I still enjoy scanning the front page of Reddit and knowing that what I’m seeing is, at least in large part, the product of organic interest and popularity. Like I said, the key to success here will be striking a balance.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_toy8","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165350999,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9796-14d8ab46-9170-459f-a976-985a81b49a67-1566236761"}

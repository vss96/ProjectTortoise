And if you have them for a month, it's all but certain that you're not including things like medical/dental, insurance, education, etc. in your $600.\r\n\r\nA woman, on the other hand, might include a disproportionate amount of her housing/food/gas/utilities/etc. in the cost, even though the ratios might not be reasonable.  On the other hand, she does have to worry about many more costs in her 11 months than you do in your 1 month (you can't assume your 1 month is representative because she 11x more likely to see a unique cost incursion than you).\r\n\r\nI can't really say where the \"actual\" number's going to be, but I personally do think that something tied to the father's income seems fair.  I.e., the father should contribute as much to the child's standard of living as he is enjoying himself: if he's living in luxury, the child should get a break.  Of course, this does introduce the moral hazard where fathers on the low end might *intentionally* work low-paying jobs (or no job at all) to avoid forking over a bigger portion of their checks to their children.\r\n\r\nIn that case, the father's a bastard anyway, and there's no real way around that.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12595-c42ecebb-9e35-494b-9469-c6d160bad79f-1566236762"}

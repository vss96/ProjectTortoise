They have the same DNA (genetics). However, at birth, for whatever reason, the mother and father decide not to raise both of them and either keep one or put them up for adoption. The two twins are then raised by separate families (society).\r\n\r\nThe result he's implying exists (I don't know if it does, but I wouldn't be surprised), is that their is a positive correlation between a twin's intelligence with his sibling. If there were no genetics involved in the situation, since the two were raised separately, you would expect their IQ scores to be independent.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807441,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ct5vx","parent_id":"t1_ct59j","author_flair_text":null,"author":"losvedir","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"15-4de35348-4145-433d-aeb1-269508b66582-1566236758"}

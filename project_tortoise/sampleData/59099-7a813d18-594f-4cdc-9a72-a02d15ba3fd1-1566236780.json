{"body":"I'm sorry, I just didn't find much useful here.  As someone who has attempted to practice frugality or voluntary simplicity for 5 years, I was looking for some profound insights here.  When we lived in the States, we imagined our life to be very simple.  When we moved to London - 2 years ago - we were challenged by simple our life had to become.  Yet, we are comfortable and happy.  I do long for the occaisional *treat* like a blender. So, I was disappointed in this article. Sort of like - duh! - yeah voluntary poverty and frugality are two entirely seperate things.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_wgxd","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167515097,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"svaha","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cwhlc","parent_id":"t3_wgxd","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809699,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59099-7a813d18-594f-4cdc-9a72-a02d15ba3fd1-1566236780"}

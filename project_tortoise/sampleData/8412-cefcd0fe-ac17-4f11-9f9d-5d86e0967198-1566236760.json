So, they wanted a decisive blow to cripple them and/or dessuade U.S. from engaging in the Pacific.  \r\n\r\nThe Japanese(leadership) believed US citizens to be weak willed and would demand their government retreat inward and become more isolationist.  This was a massive misjudgement of US character.\r\n\r\nbtw if they got the carriers and flew some more attack waves instead of retreating it probably would be viewed no as a strategic coup.\r\n","score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1165298926,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_ctmja","edited":false,"id":"ctnow","author":"njharman","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807775,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8412-cefcd0fe-ac17-4f11-9f9d-5d86e0967198-1566236760"}

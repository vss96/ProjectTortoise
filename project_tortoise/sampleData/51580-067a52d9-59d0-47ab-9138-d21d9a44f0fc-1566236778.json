My company has a partnership with Apple and I get a max discount of 6% off any item.  Education discount also tops out at about 10%.\r\n\r\nThere's a large markup on accessories.  The cost price of USB cable is only $5 on something that is normally $30.  However, the staff price (slightly higher than cost) of an Apple product is again, only about 6%.\r\n\r\nThe only iPods under 6% discount are refurbs or older models.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w2cf","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51580-067a52d9-59d0-47ab-9138-d21d9a44f0fc-1566236778"}

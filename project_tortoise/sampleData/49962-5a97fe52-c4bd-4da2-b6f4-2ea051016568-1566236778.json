Of course, if you use all the 'shortcuts' available you will never beat hand-tuned C-code in performance tests, but you almost always have the option to write C-like code and thus squeeze extra performance out of your application.\r\n\r\nOne could say that languages like Ruby are based on taking shortcuts, while languages like D *allows you* to take shortcuts.

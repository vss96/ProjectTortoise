We took calls from police, fire departments, exterminators and the general public from emergency numbers that we circulated.\r\n\r\nOnce collected into an empty hive box, a swarm will settle down and set up housekeeping a good bit of the time, with or without a queen.\r\n\r\nNew queens can be purchased from beekeeping supply stores.  (they used to be shipped through the mail)  In many instances, re-queening a collected swarm is done as a matter of course to improve it.  Contrary to popular belief, a queen does not really control a hive.  The hive will die without her, but they'll carry on collecting honey and building comb without her until they run out of replacement workers.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w1t6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809448,"author":"TaraWheeler","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw49h","parent_id":"t1_cw35p","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52338-260e8c63-fddd-4e18-b5ee-f79d480cb8f2-1566236778"}

Trying to compare ratios between theories is a pointless task, because of the possibility of it giving you infinite answers.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't your original point at all. You said that huge adjustments of several orders of magnitude were common -- that \"the measurements of cosmological things do vary by huge amounts.\"\r\n\r\nThe only examples you've offered, though, involve infinity. Infinity *isn't an amount*. The problem isn't that different measurements or models can't be compared; the problem is that you're trying to construct a ratio with something that *isn't a number*. Putting infinity in a numerator is pretty much the same as dividing by zero.\r\n\r\nWhat you're saying amounts to \"I tried to do comparison X by doing bogus made-up impossible math operation Y, and I got result Z. And gee, Z turned out pretty silly. Therefore X is clearly impossible or pointless.\"\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w8sr","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56854-c35942bf-ee1e-4b2c-9eeb-496fbac3002e-1566236779"}

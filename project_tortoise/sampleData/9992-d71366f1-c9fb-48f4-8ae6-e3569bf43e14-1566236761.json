The crux of any of it is in the phrase \"irrelevant factor\" -- and that varies with society I suspect.  Should the army allow women to be on the front line?  Is gender here an irrelevant factor?  In the 19th century, it surely was quite relevant to society; is it becoming irrelevant in the 21st century?  And what about a person's opinions.  If you are a government agency hiring someone, there thoughts on the worth of certain ancient english ballads is likely irrelavent.  What about their thoughts on say black people; particularly, if the person is a stated racist, should that be relavent in hiring the person?\r\n\r\nSo sure, some things get down to basic human dignity, and certain types of discrimination should be abhorred.  But we certainly don't ban all discrimination against people (2nd graders are given different priveleges than 6th graders, as an innocuous example) -- and it certainly isn't easy to draw a general line on what is an acceptable factor and what isn't, and moreover such a line, if it could ever exist, changes with society.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9992-d71366f1-c9fb-48f4-8ae6-e3569bf43e14-1566236761"}

Is it the last part of the equation, defining nullity, , that is so difficult? If so, why does this difficulty persists when the modern reader has experience of definitions such as sqrt(-1)=i ?\r\n\r\nEdit: Hmm... but hey, hang on there squire, if you're saying that your system is all self-consistent then in the last step can't I could go: 0^0 = ... = (0/1) x (1/0) = 1/1, so 0^0 = 0/0 = Nullity = 1.

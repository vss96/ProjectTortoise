You can't spend more than you make forever.\r\n\r\nAccountants measure trade deficits in physical goods.  However, we make many other goods that no one accounts for in the trade deficit.  It's far from clear that our trade deficit is not indefinitely sustainable.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental disconnect here is that you operate as if you believe only things you can touch have value.  Economists however believe that things have the value people place in them.  As long as people continue to want things we have, we can continue as we are without any problem.\r\n\r\nThere's some other interesting stuff about how the deficit really doesn't matter that much, it's just the level of spending.  The explanation relies on indifference curves and discount valuation.  If you really want to learn about this stuff, you should pick up *The Armchair Economist*.  That book has a lot of good stuff in it . . . and I honestly believe that you can benefit from reading it.  If nothing else, it will help you worry a little less.  :D","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39594-7c83cc1f-f6b1-495b-af04-44a51157de99-1566236773"}

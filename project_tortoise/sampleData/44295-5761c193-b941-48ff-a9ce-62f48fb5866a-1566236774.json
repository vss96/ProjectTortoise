If St. Paul had, hypothetically, been put on trial for cheating people with false claims that he could find buried treasure, and those contemporary reports still existed today, we could laugh at Christians for believing him to be an honest proponent of the Christian faith.","link_id":"t3_vnhg","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44295-5761c193-b941-48ff-a9ce-62f48fb5866a-1566236774"}

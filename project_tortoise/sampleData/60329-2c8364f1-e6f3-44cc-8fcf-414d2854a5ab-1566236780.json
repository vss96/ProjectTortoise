What are you trying to install that isn't in the default repositories? It seems like almost everybody is using apt these days, but apt is only as good as the repositories it's connected to. With Debian and Ubuntu, I haven't had the need to use more than a couple external repositories.\r\n\r\nFor ease of finding and installing software, it's a bit of a tradeoff. If I know what program I want and it's not in the default repositories, it's harder. If I'm looking for a program to use for a specific task, but I don't have a specific one in mind, using apt makes things much easier. If I know exactly what I want and it's in the default repositories, it's about the same.\r\n\r\nWhere apt wins big is updating. I don't want to have to go to mozilla.com for my Firefox updates, java.com for my Java updates, novell.com for my Evolution updates and so on. A lot of programs are coming with built-in automatic updates now, but it's not very consistant and having 20 different automatic update systems running at ones is inelegant to say the least.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wifs","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60329-2c8364f1-e6f3-44cc-8fcf-414d2854a5ab-1566236780"}

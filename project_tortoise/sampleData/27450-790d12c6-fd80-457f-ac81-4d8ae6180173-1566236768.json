There is nothing I hate more than getting in a bad accident and having police/fire/medical people there to help me within minutes. I hate that the poor and elderly have minimal health care. For that matter, I hate Meals on Wheels almost as much as I hate the book-mobile. I hate that when I start a small business, there is a government entity around to help me. I hate that my aunt's farm operation is helped out by researchers from the nearest state university. I hate that the interest on my student loans was paid for while I was in college, and I really hate that my interest rate on said loans is only 2%. And for the love of god, what is with all these sidewalks, playgrounds, and nicely paved roads?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uopb","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808496,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"cuq9h","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuphq","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27450-790d12c6-fd80-457f-ac81-4d8ae6180173-1566236768"}

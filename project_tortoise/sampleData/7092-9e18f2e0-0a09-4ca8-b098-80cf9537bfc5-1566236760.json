{"controversiality":0,"body":"Wow you people are taking this HARD. You people \r\n\r\n1. Clearly do not know how quickly Control Towers and Aviation Control first find out if a plane (especially a commerical airliner has crashed - in NYC of all places).\r\n\r\n2. Do not know that they can (if not SHOULD) tell you to land immediately.\r\n\r\n3. Do not realize that I'm satirising the incredibly slow response of the US Airforce.\r\n\r\n4. Never questioned why if commercial airlines have been ordered to land, why not civilians?\r\n\r\nOh and BraveSirRobin, I wonder, if you possess the power to tell if a plane hit the WTC, after they hit the building? Cause that's what I see in the pictures.\r\nCritical thinking, my ass.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tk02","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165257155,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":-23,"score":-23,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctl2l","parent_id":"t1_ctkgs","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807725,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7092-9e18f2e0-0a09-4ca8-b098-80cf9537bfc5-1566236760"}

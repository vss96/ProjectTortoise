It won't change someone's opinions on most moral issues (gay marriage, stem cells, etc) but it will change their opinions on some financial issues (let's give money to everyone 'cause it's nice an stuff!)\r\n\r\nThe world would be a much better place if a basic Econ class was part of more degree programs.  Just teaching simple things like, \"If you spend it, you don't have it any more!\" and the concept of sacrifices would be immensely helpful.  I hate hearing the \"Let's make everyone happy at the same time!\" bleeding hearts running around planting flowers all the time.  I'd say it teaches people balance or perhaps even scarier...moderation, as in, the world has untold shades of gray.","controversiality":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1166557425,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvec6","parent_id":"t3_vcvm","author":"PhilK","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808951,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39083-9f05c094-f8b0-41ed-bba6-e7d760d8a63b-1566236773"}

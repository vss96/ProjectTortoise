The idea that all third graders should learn the same Math, English, History, Science, etc., is insane.  Take 4 kids: One goes home after school and flips back and forth from The History Channel, The Learning Channel, and The Discovery Channel with dad (and not watching OCC, Trading Spaces, etc.), one reads Harry Potter, one gets on the computer and plays with QBASIC (or whatever the nearest equivalent is these days, I guess WinXP doesn't ship with that any more...maybe perl or even javascript?) or reads articles about Feynman and friends on wikipedia, and one just watches Cartoon Network until they go to bed.  These are all believable and, probably, not all that uncommon pursuits for a 5th or 6th grader these days (heck knows I did the same or similar things, all of them, at one time or another just for fun when I was a little kid, and I've seen friends' kids doing these things as well).  Why the hell would you expect them all to work at the same level?  Just because you have trouble getting through 'Green Eggs And Ham' doesn't mean you can't handle Algebra II.  The current system puts a hard upper bound on what kids can learn because in an elementary school (grades K-5 usually), there aren't likely to be any teachers qualified to teach Algebra or Hemingway, and this needs to be fixed.  I agree that there should be a 'minimum competency' requirement in all subjects, but I don't see why there should be a maximum, or why students should have to be held back a grade if they just happen to be not so good at one or two out of 5 or 7 subjects.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ut1n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166209337,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":7,"ups":7,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31125-b8079f7f-a69c-49cc-8eed-987faa30d9ca-1566236769"}

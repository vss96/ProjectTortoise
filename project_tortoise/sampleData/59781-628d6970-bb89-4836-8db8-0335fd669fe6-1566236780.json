If you don't fight for your rights all the time, you lose them.\r\n\r\nWhat is this crazy talk about fighting? Most people in most countries with mature cultures don't have to fight for their rights, because their leaders are aware of the history of power, that you can really only govern with the conscent of the governed (or with the backing of an much stronger external power,) or you'll have your head cut off. Of course, you can get that conscent by misleading the governed as in some countries, but the more mature the culture in a country is, the harder misleading the people is.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wh1l","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809722,"author":"mikaelhg","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cwiv2","parent_id":"t1_cwhgr","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59781-628d6970-bb89-4836-8db8-0335fd669fe6-1566236780"}

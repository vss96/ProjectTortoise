{"body":"What the BBC corresponded misses is that Mitt Romney has far more serious obstacles than his Mormonism, on the path to the Republican nomination.  For example, when he ran against Ted Kennedy for Senate, he claimed he would be a better fighter for gay rights than Kennedy!  Now, of course, he rails against gay marriage.  He also used to be strongly pro-choice, but now he's against that, too.\r\n\r\nWhat will Republican organizers and Republican primary voters find more problematic: his very very liberal former positions, or the fact that he's \"flip-flopped\" farther than anyone ever claimed Kerry did?  I can't see how he can get them to trust him.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vwgh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166985651,"author":"cos","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_vwgh","edited":false,"id":"cvxix","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809321,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48762-9a6c897d-a50a-4362-a0e3-3d6ce9dcf79e-1566236777"}

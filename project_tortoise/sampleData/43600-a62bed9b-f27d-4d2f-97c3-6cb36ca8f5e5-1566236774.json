The Ice Ages were not a \"normal\" occurances. The world didn't have massive, rapid climate change for no reason or because \"god\" said so. The earth's climate was influenced by an outside source, and you would be hard pressed to find a scientist who believes that climate change happens on a whim. We are experiencing climate change again, and any scientist that is saying it is a normal, regular, occurance is probably getting paid to say so. The VAST majority (and by \"vast majority\", I mean almost all) of scientists believe our climate change has a cause and that cause is us. The sky isn't falling because someone says so, the sky is falling. Why the sky is falling is debatable... but the debate is very very very one-sided.","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43600-a62bed9b-f27d-4d2f-97c3-6cb36ca8f5e5-1566236774"}

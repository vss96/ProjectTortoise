{"body":"Probably more reflective of the audience. CUFP is hosted as a workshop during ICFP which is a conference largely for academics doing programming language research. Haskell has been the functional paradigm research programming language of choice for years.\r\n\r\nAt CUFP itself, there were a bunch of Erlang (dynamically typed) users, too. Just the one presentation though.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, the lisps (especially CL) aren't considered as much in the paradigm as Haskell, ML, or Erlang. When the guy made his presentation on Scheme, he was hit by a bunch of (good-natured) questions on why he used that rather than a \"real\" functional programming language.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_u2pb","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","ups":9,"score":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165580229,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jmelesky","id":"cu3ox","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu3eb","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808073,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15801-f042f2eb-ce4d-4433-ac36-802ff8041c5f-1566236763"}

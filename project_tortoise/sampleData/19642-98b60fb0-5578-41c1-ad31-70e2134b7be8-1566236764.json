{"controversiality":0,"body":"That you believe any child who attends church is \"brainwashed\" shows your utter intollerance of anyone who believes other than you do. It is not brainwashing a child to tell them how you believe and why, and it is not brainwashing a child to tell them human life is sacred in all its forms, and ending it is wrong. It is not brainwashing a child when they go to sunday school, or when they attend church. When I was the age of kids in this video, what did I know about the complex issues being presented? For one thing, I understood that abortion meant killing an unborn baby. I also believed this to be wrong, then and now. Why? Because all human life is sacred, and ending human life is simply wrong.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ua04","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165725324,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-9,"ups":-9,"author":"CarlH","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuap7","parent_id":"t1_cuana","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808205,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19642-98b60fb0-5578-41c1-ad31-70e2134b7be8-1566236764"}

This comment highlights what is actually pertinent - these days, with the notable exception of those on the various extremes of the scale, no one has a problem with people of other religions for their belief but rather their culture. Look at the debates that rise in the western news with reference to Muslims - wearing veils, alleged oppression of women, &amp;c.

Good comment.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vgrv","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40874-62644e01-b77f-454b-ab48-8b117d7cf5a2-1566236773"}

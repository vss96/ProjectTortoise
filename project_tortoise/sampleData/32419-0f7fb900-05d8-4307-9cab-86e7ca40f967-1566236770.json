{"subreddit":"programming","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166281617,"controversiality":0,"body":"okay, i guess the obligatory thing to do here is to link to paul graham's essay \"How to Start a Startup.\" (http://paulgraham.com/start.html)  It's got a section on people and how to pick good people (of course it sort of presumes that you have some sort of pool of people to choose from, which you have to generate yourself, through pitching the idea to people).\r\n\r\nBesides that, mikkom is right.  most the projects that i've worked on that have fell apart have been because of miscommunication between the participants because they didn't know each other well enough.  While i haven't actually embarked on a successful startup venture yet, all the successful projects i've worked on (usually pretty small) have been with people who i've got some shared history with.\r\n\r\nAlso another mistake i've seen, is a lack of trust between the participants in the startup venture.  If you have no funding, and 5 employees but already have NDAs and 3 levels of management, you're doing something horribly horribly wrong.  If you can't trust your initial development team not to steal your ideas, then i don't really understand how you can expect to make any progress.\r\n\r\nSo i guess my neophyte checklist is, pick people you trust, people you can work with well and (from graham's list) pick people who can be described as \"animals\" about a subject.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_v0cp","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808698,"author":"notheory","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv0yv","parent_id":"t3_v0cp","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32419-0f7fb900-05d8-4307-9cab-86e7ca40f967-1566236770"}

What's more, they know, if only on an instinctual level, that the money in their bank accounts is steadily dropping.  This makes people more likely to spend and get into debt, rather than saving.  Even for things like computers that drop in price, people would wait longer to buy them if it were not for inflation.\r\n\r\nKenynesians will have you believe that people spending lots of money is good for the economy, and that saving is useless.  However, saving simply means that the money is more likely to be spent on loans to new businesses and the like, which is real economic growth.  Money only changes where resources go, and inflation makes it more likely that the money will be spent in short-sighted ways than on long-term investments.\r\n\r\nSo, when you hear people complaining about how Americans don't save enough, now you know one of the reasons why.  If things are getting more expensive, it makes sense to buy them now, or at least earlier than you would if prices were dropping.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the FED stops pumping dollars into the economy, it reveals how a lot of economic grown is just an inflation-induced buying frenzy, like a drug high.  It really sucks to come off that high, but it's part of the healing process.\r\n\r\nNobody wants to be blamed for \"causing\" the correction, so it's easier for politicans to embrace the status quo and keep inflating.  This can end in hyperinflation like in East Germany.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tkec","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":18,"ups":18,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165264332,"author":"asokoloski","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctlh6","id":"ctlnj","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807736,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7398-d5242f54-1617-43d7-adb5-43f003760f03-1566236760"}

It did in fact improve sensation for him, so he had it done to my brother an I.\r\n\r\nConsidering that you would expect a son's penis to be similar to that of his father I suspect that my brother and I are not missing out on anything, and in fact are probably better off circumsized, regardless of any supposed health benefits.\r\n\r\nSo, if anyone out there thinks I'm a wierdo, just keep in mind that I am the son of a man who got circumsized as an adult in order to determine if the procedure was worthwhile or not - and was willing to tell us about this when he told us about sex.  So yes.  I am a wierdo.  I get it from my Dad.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uors","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808498,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Joss","id":"cuqb7","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuqa0","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27475-b848b199-f3fd-4ab7-936d-066b281313b2-1566236768"}

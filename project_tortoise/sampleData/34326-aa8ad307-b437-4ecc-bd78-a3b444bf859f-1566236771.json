{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; family members\r\n\r\nIncest is a form of child abuse, protected under other laws. I see no problem with two adult family members who love each other  marrying. \r\n\r\n&gt; multiple wives/husbands\r\n\r\nPolygamy is currently outlawed because of child abuse cases and exploitation. Again, two (or more) adults who choose to marry should be allowed to.\r\n\r\n&gt; animals\r\n\r\nAnimals are not humans nor are they sentient. Animals cannot make conscious choices to marry another. That is why it is illegal.\r\n\r\n&gt; sex with 14 years olds\r\n\r\nIt is legal in many places. In fact, the age of consent in Canada is 14. There are again laws to prevent against abuse, but if you educate teens, at 14 they are fully aware of their rights and able to make their own choices.\r\n\r\nThe slippery slope argument is a type of fear mongering. These other types of relationships are independent from same-sex marriage. It would be equivalent to saying in the past that allowing women to vote would be a slippery slope to allowing animals to vote. Just unjustified fear mongering.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v4ak","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":30,"ups":30,"created_utc":1166385172,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"Kratoz","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv4vl","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv4v3","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808772,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34326-aa8ad307-b437-4ecc-bd78-a3b444bf859f-1566236771"}

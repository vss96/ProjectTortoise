Really.  You have nothing to contribute, your arguments are childish, your characterization of religion is inaccurate and bigoted, and you are way off the point.\r\n\r\nThis teacher should be fired, and a rational curriculum devised for the school-kids of the US.  The government should be empowered to make sure that religious mania (or any other form of mania) should be kept outside the schools.  You want faith schools?  Fuck off.  That's what the weekends are for, if parents are perverse enough to deny them time running around in the air.\r\n\r\nThe social contract is between the state and the individual, and the rationalist state should provide a rational education for its children.  That includes teaching them real history (as well as science) instead of the mawkish sentimental mush that passes for it in US schools.  Time to grow up, America.\r\n\r\nWhat is maddening is when the atheist maniacs use this as an excuse to piss on religion *per se*, tho' like many who are overburdened with anger and a sense of their own superiority, they liberally spray the seat, floor and their own shoes. \r\n","link_id":"t3_v6h2","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166445033,"score":13,"ups":13,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35612-092998cf-35aa-492b-a8c3-870258b720eb-1566236771"}

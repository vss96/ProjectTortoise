It is indeed naive to think that would be the case.\r\n\r\nAnyone that can't come up with so many scenarios where something is substituted for the religious excuse that it can hardly be called \"contriving\" anymore is unimaginative.\r\n\r\nYou aren't thinking carefully. You are convinced that religion is the world's biggest problem, and blame it for every single evil we face, while trying to backpedal and admit that we will still have these evils even once everyone is properly atheistic. And let's not forget how all this started, I pointed out how insulting and condescending the article was, how it was poorly conceived and likely to do more harm than good. And yet you're now crying about insults?\r\n\r\n&gt; And I didn't hint anything.\r\n\r\nAnd yet...\r\n\r\n&gt; If you look at the historical justification of wars (Crusades, Islamic Conquests, Israel-Palestine etc.) many of them were religious wars. Religion is a huge part of wars...\r\n\r\nThat is either a *hint* or something much more substantial. You simply cannot mention wars in this context unless you are asserting that a purely atheistic world would somehow eliminate or at least reduce these wars that you mentioned. And anyone that believes that is certainly naive.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vx8t","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809337,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","id":"cvydh","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvy8z","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49227-bc3a39fd-89d9-45b0-bb6a-4c928d2f3bd1-1566236777"}

It had 2 people side by side. One was a white American redneck with 2 machine guns, granades and profanity written on his shirt. Under him it was written \"Not a threat\". The other guy was a businessman in a suit with a beard and wearing a turban. Under him \"Terrorist\" was written.\r\n\r\nThat's my favourite political comic ever because of the sad truth it portrayed. Most Americans people do label them as such.","retrieved_on":1473807603,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctejk","parent_id":"t3_tdgp","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"kkrizka","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4263-b9add306-b4b6-41bf-bad6-528d8e365cf4-1566236759"}

I'm plenty allergic to animals, but I don't complain about that.\r\n\r\nThere's a difference between action and circumstance. If someone can smoke a cigarette in public, why can't I punch them public when they pass me? They're both active actions, and they both harm others.\r\n\r\n&gt;It's your responsibility to avoid situations that, while perhaps dangerous to you, are not any more dangerous than cosmic rays to the rest of us.\r\n\r\nSo in your opinion the rights of minorities don't matter? If a smoker prevents me from going somewhere in public they are violating my rights.\r\n\r\nBy your logic people with peanut allergies wouldn't be able to eat anything they don't grow or hunt themselves because there wouldn't need to be a warning since most people aren't affected.\r\n\r\nNo one ever said there was a right to smoke in public. They did say, however, that no one has the right to harm another through their direct actions. What you're advocating is \"might makes right,\" also known as mob rule.","retrieved_on":1473808403,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cul5w","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuj51","author_flair_text":null,"author":"brendankohler","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25067-2dea829f-7c7f-467a-8be5-a229a7a18813-1566236767"}

In general, if the application is so simple that a basic SELECT and INSERT is all that is needed, why use an RDBMS?\r\n\r\nAnything more complicated, like joins, unions, and sub-queries, which can easily arise in simple (properly designed) applications, are bungled.  This forces people to workaround with non-orthogonal designs or even just doing more work in the UI code.\r\n\r\nOf course, to *switch* is more work than people with some random website want to put in.  MySQL did the initial damage by somehow infiltrating the market, and then convincing people that \"it was an RDBMS\" and that it was easier to admin than the alternatives (neither being true).\r\n\r\nI think it's a good example of \"Worse is better.\"\r\n","controversiality":0,"score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165195268,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5700-126225fa-fcb6-474c-956c-3bf23693fa68-1566236759"}

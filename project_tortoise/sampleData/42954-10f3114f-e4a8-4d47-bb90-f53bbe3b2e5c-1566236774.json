You can opt\r\nfor a short list of common units or a more comprehensive list that includes\r\nsome fairly obscure terms. \r\n\r\nWhat I would like to see is an explanation of terms, such as metric ton as \r\nopposed to long or short ton and even avoirdupois as opposed to troy measurements,\r\nand that sort of thing. It would be a nice enhancement. \r\n\r\nYou can inform the site owners if you wish to see some conversion that's not\r\ncovered at present. \r\n\r\nIt's a useful tool to bookmark, but given that it is aimed at learners,\r\nit could offer a lot more on measurement terms, even by linking to outside sites. \r\nWhilst measurement is a complex subject, it has a fascinating history which would\r\nbe of great interest to learners. \r\n","retrieved_on":1473809100,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_vlzm","edited":false,"id":"cvlzp","author_flair_text":null,"author":"accelware","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42954-10f3114f-e4a8-4d47-bb90-f53bbe3b2e5c-1566236774"}

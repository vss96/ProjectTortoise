I'm confused. I always put it down to exactly those social factors. Are you saying that it is down to some _other_ social factors? Or are you saying that the popular languages in your list have some (gasp) technical advantages over the obscure/good languages?\r\n\r\nLooking back over your list, I think one think stands out: syntax.  All of the popular languages have pretty much the same syntax, whereas a most of the non-popular ones have a unique syntax. As a case study, look at ruby (which I would say is rapidly becoming a popular language) versus smalltalk. Underneath the skin they are _very_ similar. Except that ruby is _much_ slower. But smalltalk has smalltalk syntax, while ruby has a subtle variation of the ever popular c/algol syntax.\r\n\r\nNow, whether this is a social problem (people learn one syntax, and then dont like to change to a new one, and the first syntax most people learn is c/algol) or a technical problem (the human brain is just better wired for c syntax than any of the others) is another questions. But my money is on the former.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807790,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctn69","id":"ctohc","author_flair_text":null,"author":"robbie","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8702-97dcb750-a79e-4017-bc8c-5aa1c83fbca2-1566236760"}

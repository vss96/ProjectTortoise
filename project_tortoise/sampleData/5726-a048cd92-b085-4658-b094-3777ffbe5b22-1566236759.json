As long as your software is licensed with the GPL you can bundle MySQL and InnoDB with it.\r\n\r\nIf you meant to say that you cannot take GPL'd code and bundle it into software that you distribute with closed source, again you are incorrect. If you are closed-source commercial you can buy a commercial license to distribute MySQL and InnoDB.\r\n\r\nAnd there's no reason to single out InnoDB for this. The company that owns InnoDB (Innobase Oy) and the company that owns MySQL (MySQL AB) both offer this same licensing choice.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tgj7","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807669,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jamiemccarthy","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cthgi","id":"cti0r","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5726-a048cd92-b085-4658-b094-3777ffbe5b22-1566236759"}

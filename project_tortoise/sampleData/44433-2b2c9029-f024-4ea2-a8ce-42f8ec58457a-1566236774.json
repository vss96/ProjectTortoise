Her son Ben brought a stray cat home once. The cat was very quiet and never ventured too far from Ben. A few months later Ben was killed by a drunk driver. The day after as my sister was getting ready in the bathroom to go to my other sister's house (the family was all gathering there) the cat came into her bathroom. \r\n\r\nIt leapt onto the toilet seat and started to stare at her. Then it started mewling, not in a somber mood but as if it was conversing with her. My sister was dumbfounded and a little upset. One of Ben's friends came over before she left to offer her condolences. The cat ran up to Ben's friend, leapt into her arms and started again with the mewling. Again my sister was upset with this so Ben's friend said she'd take the cat. When she told me the story I told her that maybe it was Ben saying he's ok. She accepted that.\r\n\r\nOr maybe the cat was just hungry.","retrieved_on":1473809156,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vo8v","id":"cvou8","author":"artman","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44433-2b2c9029-f024-4ea2-a8ce-42f8ec58457a-1566236774"}

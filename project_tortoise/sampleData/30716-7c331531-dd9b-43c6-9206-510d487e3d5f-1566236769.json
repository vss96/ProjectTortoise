{"controversiality":0,"body":"Tests are (largely) distanced from the actual practice of any real life skill or using knowledge in a context, and thus are useless except to generate artificial intelligence numbers.  You can't prove or disprove someone's intelligence in an hour and a half, you can prove their knowledge, but not their intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn the age of Google and wikipedia, what good is knowledge for knowledge's sake?  Knowledge is useful to know that it exists, but knowing the exact equation for the slope of a line isn't going to get to help you when anyone else can look it up in 10 seconds.  If you could pass a test with Google or Wikipedia, than it's not a valid determinate of anything useful.  If there was a way to put real critical thinking on a test, or forcing someone to put knowledge in a contextual framework and calculate an answer from that, then I might say it was a worthwhile test.  (I'm sure these types of tests do exist, but they aren't the FCAT, GED, or SAT, at least from what I remember years ago)","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ut1n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166199804,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"PhilK","edited":false,"id":"cuxak","parent_id":"t1_cuttw","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808628,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30716-7c331531-dd9b-43c6-9206-510d487e3d5f-1566236769"}

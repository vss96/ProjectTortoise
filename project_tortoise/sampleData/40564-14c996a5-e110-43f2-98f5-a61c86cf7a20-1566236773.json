From my perspective this would make God cruel, and preumably, as western religions state that God is benevolent, this must not be the case, therefore I think that Christianity requires free will to work, as lacus states.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nI not sure I'm really qualified to talk about Christian belief, so any Christians/theists please do jump in :)","controversiality":0,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166610346,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40564-14c996a5-e110-43f2-98f5-a61c86cf7a20-1566236773"}

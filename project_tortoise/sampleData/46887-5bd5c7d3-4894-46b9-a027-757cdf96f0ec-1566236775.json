It was like a game.\r\n\r\nOnce my parents ADMITTED that Santa wasn't real, it took all the fun out of it, heh.\r\n\r\nSo my advice?  When your kids ask you if Santa Claus is real, just reply with, \"I don't know.  Is he?\"  Make your kids figure it out on their own.  Telling them that he's not real and expecting them to blindly believe you is just about as bad as telling them he is real and expecting them to blindly believe you.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166853394,"score":7,"ups":7,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46887-5bd5c7d3-4894-46b9-a027-757cdf96f0ec-1566236775"}

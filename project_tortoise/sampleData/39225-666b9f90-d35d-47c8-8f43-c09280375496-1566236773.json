They are NOT investing in the US.  They are propping up an export market to tide them over while they develop internal markets.  They have written off their $1 trillion reserves.  They know it's worthless.  It's just part of a strategy.  Why do you think they're trying so hard to unload their dollars by buying hard assets in the US and around the world?\r\n\r\nPrivate investors in China are emphatically NOT investing in the US.  This is a central bank manipulation.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vct7","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808956,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"kkrev","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvdds","id":"cvelf","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39225-666b9f90-d35d-47c8-8f43-c09280375496-1566236773"}

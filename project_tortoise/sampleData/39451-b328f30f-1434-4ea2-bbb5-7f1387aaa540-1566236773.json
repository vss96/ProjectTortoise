Look at what the programs are actually doing. They're using XML/HTML libraries to manipulate RSS and generate HTML. They're not using RSS aggregation libraries, nobody would be interested in that.\r\n\r\nThe cool idea to take away is that the style of these XML/HTML libraries is one which allows you to do fairly interesting things with very little work. Essentially, they give you an ideal sublanguage for manipulating XML or HTML, inside of the language which you're already using. They give you various primitive programs, and means of combining those programs into more useful ones very quickly.\r\n\r\nThat's at least what I want everyone to see. :) Haskell and Scheme are both very cool languages, but that's less the issue here.","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39451-b328f30f-1434-4ea2-bbb5-7f1387aaa540-1566236773"}

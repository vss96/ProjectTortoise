I worked at a web company and sat next to a really good graphic designer who did the CSS/HTML and graphics on the site for the company and I learned a ton from him while I was there. Just little stuff you'll pickup through the days. The obvious things are don't try to crowd too much onto the screen, leave plenty of space, limit clicks... stuff like that.

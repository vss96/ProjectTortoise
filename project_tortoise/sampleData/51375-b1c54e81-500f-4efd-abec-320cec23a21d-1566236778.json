{"body":"Isn't the point of new and fancy hardware to provide better implementation of your design?  With the specific-task speed available to the Cell, one can imagine implementing *games of a certain type* better than ever before, much like the Wii's new input mechanisms allow the designer to implement games of another type better than before.  One has upped the ante in a more laymanish, obvious way (because CPU hardware is insanely complex), and that's what I believe the author is ignoring.\r\n\r\nIs one \"better\" than the other?  I think the Wii might be, but I'm not completely convinced yet - after watching the DS, which suffered through a period where **everybody** wanted to use the stylus even when not appropriate (Castlevania:Dawn of Sorrow, I'm looking at you), I wonder if the Wii would be the same way if the \"Classic\" controller isn't a viable option to the designer.  Not every game will be enhanced by Wiimote functionality.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vtff","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167153780,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"RSquared","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cw11l","edited":false,"id":"cw2jx","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809415,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51375-b1c54e81-500f-4efd-abec-320cec23a21d-1566236778"}

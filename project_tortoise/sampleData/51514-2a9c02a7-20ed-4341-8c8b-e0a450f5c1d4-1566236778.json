Without having the incentive of reelection, then why shouldn't someone accept thousands or even millions of dollars from these groups?  I think what you would end up with is a congress made up of a few idealists and a majority of people who were easily bribed.  No one would have to get other folks to go along with their corruption.  Instead, the lobbying group would just bribe everyone (overtly or more indirectly) to vote one way or another.  Laws preventing this would be difficult to enforce, and cases would be difficult to adjudicate.  For instance, what if someone is secretly told that they will be given a gift after their term if they vote a certain way?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm wondering whether the lottery would include everyone in the nation who met age qualifications, or only those who chose to register for it.  Would you include any other requirements?","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167159265,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvxr1","id":"cw2u3","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","retrieved_on":1473809421,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51514-2a9c02a7-20ed-4341-8c8b-e0a450f5c1d4-1566236778"}

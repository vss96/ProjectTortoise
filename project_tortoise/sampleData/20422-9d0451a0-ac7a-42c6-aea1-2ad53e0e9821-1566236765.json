Put in thousands of orders for military parts from Chinese factories to go to war?\"\r\n\r\nIf you hadn't checked there's an arms embargo on China, that means no country can legally import weapons into China or export them out, and under the terms of the arms embargo it includes anything capable of making a weapon including parts.\r\n\r\nThe mainstay of the US military in terms of personel weapons, the M16, is manufactured by Colt (based in the US) and Fabrique Nationale (based in Belgium, also obligated to the arms embargo). US Airforce planes are primarily made by Boeing or Lockheed Martin, now as Lockheed is based in Maryland if that's owned by China shut the fuck up complaining because you're already *in* China!\r\n\r\nThurthermore US military weapons are based on the NATO ammo standardisation, Chinese are still on the Russian specifications as they use the AK-47 and similar Russian derived weapons.\r\n\r\nFinally why in all that's sane would China invade North Korea, when they have a fucking support treaty to it, they wouldn't need to invade they'd just stop sending the country food for a few months till everyone starves to death. It's like England invading Wales, it makes so little sense it actually destroys sense itself.\r\n\r\nOh my god, I think I've figured out how the US people voted for the Republicans a second time, they're so annoyingly stupid you have to nod agreeingly just so they won't say anything.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ubdm","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"created_utc":1165774661,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20422-9d0451a0-ac7a-42c6-aea1-2ad53e0e9821-1566236765"}

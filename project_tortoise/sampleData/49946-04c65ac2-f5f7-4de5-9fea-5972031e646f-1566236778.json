{"body":"Morgellons disease is a form of extraterrestrial, silicon-based parasite which mimics carbon life as much as possible.  Armed with a hive-like intelligence, latest-generation Morgellons sufferers report an almost-Gao'uld-like raport with the vermin, and some speculate that they are getting ever-increasingly adept at forming permanent colonies in host victims that appear and feel as though they actually were carbon molecules part of one's body.\r\n\r\nIt's sort of like if the Replicators latched onto you and started converting you piece by piece until they could communicate with and eventually control you.  First appearing en masse in 2001-2002, Morgellons parasites can be seen as a form of Second Wave (the first being the initial scouts/colonizers that came several tens of thousands of years ago).  The Third Wave, of course, would involve a completely 'terraformed' world (of about 55-60 C) along with a totally enslaved, hive-minded humanity coupled with Faster Than Light travel.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vyxb","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167072489,"author":"hopeseekr","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_vyxb","id":"cvzuy","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809365,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"49946-04c65ac2-f5f7-4de5-9fea-5972031e646f-1566236778"}

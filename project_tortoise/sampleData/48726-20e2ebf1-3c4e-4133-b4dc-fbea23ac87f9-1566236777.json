It is what inspired the authors to write the books that is interesting, whether it was the belief they were directed by God, or the events they witnessed during their lives. \r\n\r\n&gt; carnage and mass extermination aside\r\n\r\nSo often people mention this as some sort of black mark against the Bible. Are there not good moral lessons to be learned from these as well? I think it is telling that these stories are not omitted.\r\n\r\n&gt; Sure this is at odds with what the power brokers at the helm of each faith actually want\r\n\r\nAnd some of us theists would agree with you. Often, these powerbrokers, as you call them, do more harm than good, and are not accurate representations of the faith they posit.

It dehumanises people, it implies that Islam the religion is tied to Fascism - which not only slanders an entire religious group, but is also a big reason why Iraq has been conflated with Al Queda in the public mind.  (Osama bin Laden is an Islamic Theocrat. Saddam Hussein is a Secular Fascist.  Those two groups HATE each other.  To top it off, the guys the U.S. army are actually fighting NOW are best described as Nationalist Anarchists.)   \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong - I've got no love for the Islamic faith or, for that matter, any organized religion (and most of the disorganized ones can be lumped into that bunch.)  But what I REALLY don't like is people being PROUD of their ignorance.  \r\n\r\nIgnorance is forgivable and so long as we are not omniscient, part of the human condition.  \r\n\r\nPRIDE in ignorance is best classified as stupidity.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wcfe","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56748-79f0fac7-548b-4fb2-979f-15432c6f84bd-1566236779"}

Once you've made one copy, almost no labor is needed to make a million just like it. So everything depends on the work done by one person or a small team.\"\r\nThen, he generalizes it to hardware as well, saying:\r\n\"When you buy a computer, pay no more than 60% of the price of the most expensive one in the store, unless you have special needs. Usually, at 60%, diminishing returns have set in.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, he ends with these words of wisdom:\r\n\"And, yes, nowadays it is normal to spend more on software than on the computer. Didn't your CD collection cost more than your CD player? Same principle.\"\r\nMy CD collection does cost more than my player. But two of my audio CD's don't cost as much as my player. Windows XP Pro + Office do cost as much as my computer. And he totally ignores the fact that a computer is much more complicated than an audio player.","link_id":"t3_ujgi","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24379-0df1ff4a-2c2d-477b-b025-333af80b871d-1566236767"}

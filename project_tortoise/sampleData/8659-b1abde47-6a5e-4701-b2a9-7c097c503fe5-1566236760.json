I worked in an offshoot of the main org who supplied spare parts and things to pretty much every section of the world. That part of the company alone took in $80 million a year.\r\n\r\nThey had *two* separate databases (custom applications) containing pretty much the same data. One written in the  70's, in COBOL, the other a piece of turd VB6 app. \r\n\r\nHowever these apps didn't communicate. So the IT guy there was commissioned to write a \"link\". He did this using Microsoft access. It couldn't have been slower (updating one tiny piece of information would take &gt;30 seconds). \r\n\r\nAny way this app then, ta da, exported your choice of data to excel. Before I got the summer job there what they did was have people go through a 12,000 row excel file, delete or update, based on another sheet that someone had marked up in pen.\r\n\r\nNot only did they use excel badly, but they didn't even use it to take the manual labour out of their work. In my first week there I wrote some macros in excel (which i had never used before, being a linux user). This left 5 people sitting around half the day with nothing to do.\r\n\r\nLesson:  Most of the people sitting around in half the offices on this planet could be replaced by a 3 line perl or ruby script.","score":15,"ups":15,"created_utc":1165315183,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8659-b1abde47-6a5e-4701-b2a9-7c097c503fe5-1566236760"}

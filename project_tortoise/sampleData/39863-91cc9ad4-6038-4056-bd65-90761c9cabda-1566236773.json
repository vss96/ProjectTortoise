Whenever he achieved this he would call it the \"book proof.\" However, perhaps it is futile to search for short proofs in all cases, as we know (eg. from the theory of chaos) that seemingly simple things can generate great complexity. So can an information-theoretic approach be used to prove that there are infinitely many more problems with complex proofs than elegant proofs?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question should follow from Chaitin's work on \"elegant programs\" via a Curry-Howard-style correspondence, where type and term correspond to problem and proof. If you look at this work, you'll see that the more interesting question is if it's always possible to decide whether a given proof is elegant or inelegant. In fact, it is not; this relates to Goedel's incompleteness theorem and Turing's halting problem.\r\n\r\n&gt; Also I have a related question: if a proof is very long, can we really believe it?\r\n\r\nProofs, when formalized, can be mechanically checked for correctness. A proof checker, as opposed to a theorem prover, is very simple in theory as well as practice. If you have confidence in the proof checker and the platform on which it executes, then you can have confidence in proofs certified by the checker. The greater uncertainty here is the platform, of course.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39863-91cc9ad4-6038-4056-bd65-90761c9cabda-1566236773"}

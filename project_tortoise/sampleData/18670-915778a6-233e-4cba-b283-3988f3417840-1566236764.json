It is the very lowest.\r\n\r\nZogby's polls have generally been in line with other pollsters, although on the low side.  This particular poll is low, but there's a margin of error of +/-3.2%.  It's not like he's just a propangadist who should be dismissed, as yo implied.\r\n\r\n&gt;Harry Truman's numbers (his real numbers - not his Zogby numbers) were also in the low 30s, but he is now considered to be one of the best Presidents we ever had. The same thing will happen to Bush.\r\n\r\nBWAHAHAHAH!  If there was a reasonable time frame for this prediction, I'd bet you money.  Too bad you'll never have to pay a price for being wrong.\r\n\r\n&gt;Don't forget that the Democrats in Congress voted for this war too.\r\n\r\nDemocrats in Congress = spineless.  The fact that they voted for the war only indicates that polls showed that it was popular at the time, not that everybody thought it was a good idea.","link_id":"t3_u6s9","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18670-915778a6-233e-4cba-b283-3988f3417840-1566236764"}

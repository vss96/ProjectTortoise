Many people could be taught to replicate the \"virtuoso talent\" this woman has. But, these 'skills' are undervalued.  It really about the *character* of the teacher. These character traits involve a respect for children; an assumption that they want to learn and taking action on reinforcing those ideas.  You can find these skills discussed in any number of books: \"Mindful Parenting,\" \"Positive Discipline,\" Children Of A Child-Centered School,\" and \"How Children Learn,\" just to name a few.   \r\n\r\nI did a residency recently at an art centre with \"bad kids.\"  Simply walking into the room and expecting them to participate was enough to get them going.  I was delighted at the first stabbing attempt. It showed I was making progress.  Rather than get mad, I looked at the kid and said, \"Having so much fun learning must feel really scary for you.  That's okay. We'll find another way to deal with it together.\"  The administrators were shocked that in 4 weeks I had these \"awful children\" using exacto knives and spray paint constructively.  It's all attitude.  These attitudes can be taught.  I learned them.  But, I had to \"unlearn a lot of bulltwaddle first.  I might add in my defence - I had a high student/teacher ratio.  That helps.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w17r","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167216748,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52742-1f96677f-9c98-4e48-981f-c53e7f0202b1-1566236778"}

The morons that tune into his shit daily, on the other hand, definitely are.\r\n\r\nI don't even think that's necessarily true.\r\n\r\nI mean, certainly, there are stupid people who fall for O'Reilly's crap, but I know at least one clever, quick-witted, personable, and normally friendly guy who, at the slightest hint of politics, turns nasty and quickly makes it clear that he's a True Believer in O'Reilly, Limbaugh, Fox News, our President, and so forth.\r\n\r\nHe's definitely not a stupid man.  I tend to think of him as  woefully misled and misinformed, with his anger misdirected.  \r\n\r\nMaybe he's very much the exception; maybe most True Believers are just idiots.  But it definitely seems to me that, not coincidentally, the modus operandi of the right wing spin machine is exactly that: mislead and misinform, to misdirect the anger.","link_id":"t3_th82","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807670,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Glaxnor","id":"cti34","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cthjv","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5756-163535ed-41dc-4702-8c11-d1d6e276e54e-1566236759"}

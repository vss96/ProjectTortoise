People who are interested in health and trans fats already know what kinds of food have them.  Most people who don't know don't care.\r\n\r\nSo, this would benefit the small fraction of the population who only eat greasy fried foods because they *don't know that they're unhealthy*.  And yet the cost is forcing every restaurant to do all the measurements to figure out how much trans fats are in the final dishes they serve, which is certainly not free.\r\n\r\nThis also would have the effect of making it that much harder to start a new restaurant.  All of the effects of this policy would be to drive up the cost of food for New Yorkers.\r\n\r\nNo, the government should be doing nothing here.

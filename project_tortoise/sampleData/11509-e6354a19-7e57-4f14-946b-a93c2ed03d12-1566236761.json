Sell the stuff legally over the counter to anyone 18 or older. Put 1/50th of the cost of enforcement into free-for-all drug treatment programs. And watch as millions of americans light up joints and discover that they don't even really care for it so much.\r\n\r\nWould even reduce murder.\r\n\r\nI'm not particularly tough on crime. In many cases (all crimes but murder), I'd lessen penalties. The 3 strikes laws are all bullshit... get some hardass prosecutor who won't reduce, and suddenly your 3 felonies of breaking into vending machines for quarters sends you away for life? I don't even really care to be tough on the kid, I just have no compassion for him. He's forfeited that. But I wouldn't be soft on him either.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165417629,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11509-e6354a19-7e57-4f14-946b-a93c2ed03d12-1566236761"}

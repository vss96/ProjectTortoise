Have you forgotten about Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Webern, Shostakovich, Pierre Boulez, Messiaen, Ginastera, etc?\r\nAnd I challenge you to name a song that has a fugue in it. What is counterpoint is debatable, but I highly doubt that any modern pop song has a subject that gets treated in every voice sequentially, has episodes, retrogrades/inversions/stretto treatment of the subject, etc. Seriously.\r\n\r\nModern pop music is primitive crap. However many 7s or 9s or suspended 4ths you smack on to a chord, or however many times you invert it, it's still the same chord. I-IV-V-I was perfected by Mozart, and that's that.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tn3v","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8897-20457c6d-7624-4304-a9e1-a108389ae0d4-1566236760"}

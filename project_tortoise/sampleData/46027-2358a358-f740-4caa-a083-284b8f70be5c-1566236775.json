{"body":"Here's how World of Warcraft works.\r\n\r\nIt's a lot like paper-rock-scissors, but using the \"mouse\" and \"keyboard\" if you will. You control a virtual character in the game world, and can undertake activities such as crafting armor, baking bread, building bridges and designing model train sets.\r\n\r\nYou use your character to negotiate trade agreements with neighboring countries, like the Night Elves, the Gnomes, and the Unicorns. Sometimes these trade negotiations can be very intense, which is where a lot of the excitement comes in. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if your character dies in World of Warcraft, you die in real life. Which definitely helps you focus, but can be a bit unnerving at times.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vq8u","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166817364,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"conrad_hex","parent_id":"t1_cvr8n","edited":false,"id":"cvs2m","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809218,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46027-2358a358-f740-4caa-a083-284b8f70be5c-1566236775"}

It's a desperate work-around for the absence of a usable update mechanism in the operating system, and if it \"works\" now, it has been a long time coming.\r\n\r\nBut Firefox's auto-update doesn't really work, in that it's not secure.  Installing and upgrading core software like a browser requires special write privileges on your file system.  Otherwise any software could install and modify any other software.  \r\n\r\nUbuntu and Mac OS X users know this: they have to enter a password before installing and upgrading software.  Windows users don't know it because they haven't experienced it.  When things go wrong, they don't know why, probably because they tend to trust Microsoft's explanation.\r\n\r\nHere's an old example of the write privileges problem.  When a web page makes \"[a simple and polite request for your browser to overwrite the contents of your OS kernel with the bookmarks (favorites) file](http://www.crackmonkey.org/fanmail.html#CHAPTER1)\", Windows lets the browser do so.\r\n\r\nSee also: [sudo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo), and [Tim Bray on apt](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/31/Ubuntu#p-1).\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v6sz","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166499523,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37460-f60dba2c-6f89-4138-b232-ba070cca024f-1566236772"}

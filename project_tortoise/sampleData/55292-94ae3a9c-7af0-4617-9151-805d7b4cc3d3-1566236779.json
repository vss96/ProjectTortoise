Nobody says \"well, that's an awful wonderful pill / invention / whatever. How dare you try to sell it!\" As a matter of fact, it's hard (at least for me) to find any ethical or practical arguments against BUYING organs. There are, however, plenty of ethical and practical arguments against the SELLING of organs, which would then of course preclude the buying. Selling somebody a life-saving pill does not put the doctor at high physical risk nor does it consign him to a life of greater possible physical complications than pre-prescription. We also assume that doctors aren't assigning pills that will have negative effects just to make some quick cash.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809555,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw9wz","parent_id":"t1_cw8xn","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55292-94ae3a9c-7af0-4617-9151-805d7b4cc3d3-1566236779"}

{"body":"Why is it that a population reduction is a bad thing?  The Earth is over-populated.  Maybe we have some sort of in-born population cap.  Our bodies understand that there are enough (or too many?) people in the world, and it then hampers our desire to have children.\r\n\r\nSo what if we lose a fifth of the population of the world due to low birth rates?

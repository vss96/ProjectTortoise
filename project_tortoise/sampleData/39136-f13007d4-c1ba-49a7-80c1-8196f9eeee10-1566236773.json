Jews, Muslims, Protestant or Amish, there are always criminals and plain assholes in every group of people.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, although people of all faiths and nations get in semi-violent arguments in busses every day, such stories don't tend to appear in Reddit's homepage very often. Except when it's Jews in Israel, in which case it gets *174 points*.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, no one is anti semite here. Hypocrite, stupid, mindless sheep - possibly.

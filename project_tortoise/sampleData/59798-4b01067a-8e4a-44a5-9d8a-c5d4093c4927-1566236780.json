The same speaker measured by two different labs may yield different response graphs. And some companies just plain cheat when they publish response curves.\r\n\r\nYou can always measure the speaker response curve yourself with something like [FuzzMeasure](http://www.fuzzmeasure.com/).  It uses [log sweeps instead of MLS](http://support.supermegaultragroovy.com/wiki/index.php/Log_Sweeps_vs_MLS), but you still get a FR curve at the end.

{"body":"Unfortunately, I am reminded of how in various previous conflicts, when the actions of one side or another violated the expectations of the other, the phrase \"no honor\" was used just before the new actions became standard tactics.\r\n\r\nFor example, American revolutionaries who, by engaging in guerilla tactics, refused to conform to what the Redcoats expected were accused of having no honor.  Similar accusations were made during WWI when some people got into trenches instead of standing above ground to be killed.\r\n\r\nI think the current state of tactics is approaching the extreme hypothetical limit known in Eastern martial arts as \"fu-kyu\" where anything goes.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ve7v","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166556778,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"keylime","edited":false,"id":"cvean","parent_id":"t3_ve7v","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808950,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39061-d573e501-459e-4c06-a317-4969857b5ed8-1566236773"}

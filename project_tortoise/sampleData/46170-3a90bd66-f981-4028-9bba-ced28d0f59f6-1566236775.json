Wave functions can only be in superposition unless you consider some kind of interaction. Two photons are a good example for (nearly) free superposable wave functions. But if you consider two electrons they interact via the electromagnetic field - and your linearity is gone. Thats where the fun begins.\r\n\r\nFor 'many worlds' we need a mechanism which constrains those interactions to the 'right' parts of the wave function, but this seems for me totally unphysical, because there is only one total wave function. Which mechanism should decide how interactions are limited? \r\n\r\nThe whole concept of many worlds is totally unphysical and everybody who chastises physicists who believe in it is totally right.\r\n","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166821347,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cvsar","parent_id":"t1_cvs8s","author":"kawa","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809221,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46170-3a90bd66-f981-4028-9bba-ced28d0f59f6-1566236775"}

Besides, does that energy consumption figure take into account the extra energy required to gather the much rarer raw materials and produce the fluorescent bulbs.  Also, the cycle rate of fluorescent bulbs is lower, which isn't so good for you in the long run.  Fact is, fluorescent bulbs won't change global warming.  Best case scenario, if everyone changes all their bulbs, that is 50% of 10% of 20% of energy consumption, not all that big a deal (1%).  The only thing that would have any effect is a drastic change in lifestyle, not some quick fix simple technology.","controversiality":1,"score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165094425,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"science","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctdiw","id":"ctdk1","author_flair_text":null,"author":"limukala","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807583,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3816-b03ef623-742b-46fa-a157-c14568749aa1-1566236759"}

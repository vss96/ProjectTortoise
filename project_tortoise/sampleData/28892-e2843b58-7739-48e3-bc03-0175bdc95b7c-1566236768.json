I've read Congo, Airframe, the Terminal Man, the hospital stories, JP, sphere, the one about the chick coughing between the sheets during the affair, a whole bunch of his books.\r\n\r\nI actually re-read my hardbound copy of Timeline this year and made my gf read it.  \r\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be much gray area here.  At the least it is a bad coincidence that should have been edited out.  No matter how mad Crichton was for the critique about his environmental views, child molestation has nothing to do with a global warming debate.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_us8a","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166130361,"author":"jetsetter","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cuszf","edited":false,"id":"cutck","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808554,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28892-e2843b58-7739-48e3-bc03-0175bdc95b7c-1566236768"}

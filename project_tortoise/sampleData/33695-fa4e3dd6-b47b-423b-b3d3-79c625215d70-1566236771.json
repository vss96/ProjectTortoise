{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v3lw","stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"body":"I agree with your article that the government is targeting certain families and kids to attach academic selection.  It seems more than nasty, it is also underhand.  I am sure the Government knows that the partially selective schools involved generally made a definate choice to be partially selective and also have siblings, rather than being fully selective.  Many of these schools are hundreds of years old, and some where fully selective in the past.  So these schools want to both specialise in teaching academically gifted children AND keep families together and educate all abilities.  The Government could not, or was too scared to, stop them admitting some of their intake on ability, so they are, if I can use the word, blackmailing these schools.  The stark choice for these schools, if the draft Code becomes law, will be to lose their siblings OR lose their ability places.  If they drop their selection to 10% on abtitude based on a 'specialism'they can keep their siblings!  if they don't drop their selection places they must lose their family ethos.  I expect, but might be wrong, that many of these schools will keep the families and lose the selection.  So the Government will get what it really wants, a reduction in ability places, but by uusing familieis and kids as the blackmail tool!  Nasty? I think so!!!","ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166353006,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cv3mb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_v3lw","author_flair_text":null,"author":"ekurland","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808748,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33695-fa4e3dd6-b47b-423b-b3d3-79c625215d70-1566236771"}

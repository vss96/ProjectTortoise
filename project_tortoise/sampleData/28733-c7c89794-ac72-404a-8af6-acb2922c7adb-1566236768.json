If this is supposed to throw another log on the Windows/Mac flamewar, it's not working. I just...don't care. As many have pointed out in other threads, widgets/gadgets are not a new concept Apple came up with in OS X. I'm more sympathetic with the argument that Apple stole the current widgets idea from Konfabulator, which was great until they were assimilated by Google. However, as others have pointed out, the basic widget concept can be traced as far back as the old Apple desk accessories model, possibly further.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_usze","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808548,"distinguished":null,"author":"ewokjedi","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cut23","parent_id":"t3_usze","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28733-c7c89794-ac72-404a-8af6-acb2922c7adb-1566236768"}

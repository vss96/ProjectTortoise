{"controversiality":0,"body":"See this is why I don't give money to charities, I only give directly to those in need.  Why couldn't your job be done by 3 part time people freely donating their time, instead of you doing it full time for 70% of all the money you bring in?  And if you're really doing this administrative charity work out of the goodness of your heart and not just because it's a day job for you, then you should only be taking the minimum salary needed to live a lower middle class salary, any more is just stealing from the charity box for your own personal gain.

{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t8ou","controversiality":0,"body":"strongly agreed. I've come very close to being hit twice in the last couple of years, in both case I was crossing  the street and was inside the intersection before the cars arrived. one was an ignored stop sign, the other was where the car turned w/o stopping at a red light (young female drivers on the phone in both cases). In both cases I was saved by noticing early...gave me time to brake hard or accelerate (thankfully the speed limit was 25)\r\n\r\nOne rule of thumb I've found helpful is to make eye contact with the driver. Of course that wouldn't have helped in this case, but can avoid some of the incidents at intersections.","ups":3,"score":3,"created_utc":1165014060,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctai6","parent_id":"t1_ctaev","edited":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807527,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2369-4047ed68-2076-464c-8104-fcc60e63c1c7-1566236758"}

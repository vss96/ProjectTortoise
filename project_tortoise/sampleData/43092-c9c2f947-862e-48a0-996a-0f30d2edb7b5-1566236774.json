It doesn't tell you what happened until halfway into the story. Even [the Sun](http://www.thesun.co.uk) will give you the actual gist in the third paragraph of their stories.\r\n\r\nThen it tosses in irrelevant details like how Dick Armstrong was a coach in the middle of the section where it tries to explain the events.\r\n\r\nThe use of Paula McVey's name is confusing since it's mentioned in the beginning and then at the end as just \"McVey\". You're left trying to remember who the hell it is. As it turns out, she's a random person interviewed.","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1166707930,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43092-c9c2f947-862e-48a0-996a-0f30d2edb7b5-1566236774"}

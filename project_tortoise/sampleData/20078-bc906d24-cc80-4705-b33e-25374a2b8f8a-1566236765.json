Not 'simple' as in 'simple minded'.\r\n\r\nA feature which isn't obtrusive and isn't standing in your way doing things you have to do often, is no problem but in fact an asset. You can have a program with 99% unused and complicated features as long as the common used ones are easy to access, to learn, and to use.\r\n\r\nWhats really not simple is to find, learn and use another program, if the one you use don't solves certain problems because of its limited feature set. Not having one (for a particular user) important feature can be much worse then some additional complicity because of 'unimportant' features. And the more feature you omit, the more probable it is, that some of those were important to somebody. \r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808222,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_ualu","edited":false,"id":"cubmy","author":"kawa","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20078-bc906d24-cc80-4705-b33e-25374a2b8f8a-1566236765"}

If someone disrespects you, you aren't likely to respect them and vice-versa.  I think this kind of mentality about respect would result in a bit less of the \"bitch-factor\" in the \"customer is always right\" mentality.  \r\n\r\nBut, let's face it, some people are just assholes and it doesn't matter if they're the customer, the employee, the father, mother, brother, lover etc. they will always be an asshole and care little to nothing about the feelings of others.  I'm not making excuses for them, by no means, but I don't think we need to eliminate this cornerstone of our capitalist economy (\"the customer is always right\") because some people suck at life.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_upgw","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808527,"author":"Th3_C0bra","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_upgw","id":"curvg","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28113-2bfd05aa-dc73-46ee-8295-b39aaf4d50cd-1566236768"}

The fact that Copenhagen's gibberish was ever taken seriously is an indictment of all mainstream quantum physicists in the 20th century. It was a sign of their desperate clinging to a classical view of the universe and a refusal to accept quantum mechanics on its face. And what do you think it says that \"QM works so good\" and yet quantum physicists refused to take it seriously?\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of what you say, it is nothing but idiotic ramblings.\r\n\r\nThe question is, are wavefunctions PHYSICALLY REAL?\r\n\r\nIf you answer \"yes\" which you must to take quantum mechanics seriously, then you have no problem. At that point you accept the reality of decoherence, entanglement, many-worlds, many-histories and many other wonderful insights into the makeup of physical reality.\r\n\r\nIf you think that the wavefunction is NOT real then you are a fucking idiot. Which you are. Because then you have to ask yourself, *why does quantum mechanics say anything about physical reality*? To which there can be no sensible answer because the notion that something which isn't physically real still has physically real effects is total fucking nonsense.\r\n\r\nNot that this stops fucking idiots from claiming one of two things. Either they say \"magic happens\" and then we call them Copenhagen-fucking-idiots. Or they put their fingers in their ears yelling \"tralala I can't hear you because reality doesn't matter\" in which case we call them simply fucking idiots.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809203,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvqzr","id":"cvrcq","author":"richardkulisz","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45648-2a3d0d91-6054-4400-a2aa-cd9d9d89aa2a-1566236775"}

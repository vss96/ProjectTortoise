Paxton:\r\n\r\n&gt; Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victim-hood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.\r\n\r\nPaxton further defines fascism's essence as:\r\n\r\n&gt; 1. a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond reach of traditional solutions; \r\n\r\n&gt; 2. belief oneâ€™s group is the victim, justifying any action without legal or moral limits; \r\n\r\n&gt; 3. need for authority by a natural leader above the law, relying on the superiority of his instincts; \r\n\r\n&gt; 4. right of the chosen people to dominate others without legal or moral restraint; \r\n\r\n&gt; 5. fear of foreign \"contamination.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism","created_utc":1167237342,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53167-43f0de0f-ee0a-4b5e-86a2-3a9adb5a2559-1566236778"}

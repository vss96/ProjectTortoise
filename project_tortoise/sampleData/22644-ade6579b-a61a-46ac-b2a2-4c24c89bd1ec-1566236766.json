{"body":"Naked shorting is among the most dangerous things because there's no cap to potential losses.\r\n\r\nThat's why people don't (shouldn't) naked short.  If you set the right stops, there's no difference between going short and going long.\r\n\r\nYour problem is that you're being unnecessarily abrasive.  The problem that you mention with shorts covering occurs just the same with longs dumping.  The problem you mention with so many shorts in the market ... well, if you go long, you'll be siding with many many like-minded people also (and thus also not be an insightful genius).\r\n\r\nThe point of investing is not to be an \"insightful genius\" but rather to call the movement (which often times means following the trend, which means betting the same way as much of the market at large) and to limit your risk (put stops, whether going long or short).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ucp9","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165857891,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"duketime","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cuebe","edited":false,"id":"cugfw","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808312,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22644-ade6579b-a61a-46ac-b2a2-4c24c89bd1ec-1566236766"}

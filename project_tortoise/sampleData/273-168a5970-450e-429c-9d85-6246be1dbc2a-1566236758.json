Most if not all IQ tests are written by men.  I have no problem believing that men score higher on IQ tests, but I don't believe this means men are more \"intelligent\".\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as an example, the Stanford-Binet test comprises 10 sections.  Your final score is merely a composite number, and depends on the weighting of the sub-sections.\r\n\r\nIf you weight visual-spatial (which is generally considered to favor males) more than other areas, you will bias the test differently than if you give more weight to the verbal half of each factor.  Two people with identical \"IQ scores\" may have widely different profiles across the sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Parts of the corpus callosum, a major neural system connecting the two hemispheres, as well as another connector, the anterior commissure, appear to be larger in women, which may permit better communication between hemispheres.\r\n\r\nFrom http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00018E9D-879D-1D06-8E49809EC588EEDF&amp;pageNumber=4&amp;catID=9\r\n\r\nFrom this a crude guesstimate might be that multi-disciplinary thinking may favor women, while narrowly focused reasoning may favor men; this may be like, to an extremely rough approximation, two CPU cores vs. one faster CPU core, or less roughly, two network nodes connected by gigabit ethernet vs. 100 mbit.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t48y","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807448,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lemmikins","id":"ct6bm","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t48y","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"273-168a5970-450e-429c-9d85-6246be1dbc2a-1566236758"}

After all, you hear stories nowadays of childen of Bible believing Catholics turning into Agnostics or converting to Buddhism; Atheist scientists finding thier faith again; and so on. A person's childhood experiences go a long way to shape them as they mature, but ultimately, in a free society as adults, they might go anywhere and pretty much believe anything. Granted you did your job as a parent and taught them how to reason and gave them strong morals as a child (either through religion or not), they will end up making thier own conclusions about life, the universe and everything. \r\n\r\nOf course, if you are reffering to what conclusions they might reach if they are isolated from the rest of society at a young age, then I suggest reading William Golding's \"Lord of the flies\".","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ua04","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20186-3acb2377-16e2-4526-ba31-dca907e083d8-1566236765"}

Many of these are just signs of stress.  They will show up in anyone who is being raked over the coals.\r\n\r\nAnd minor inconsistencies can be found in just about anything that anyone says.  We very rarely say exactly what we mean.  We tend to say something that is close enough and rely on the receiver to figure out the most reasonable interpretation.  The trouble is, when you have a hostile receiver (police officer, lawyer giving cross examination, etc.) they can almost always find something that's not quite true or a little contradictory, and then they can hammer on it and fluster the person talking, and then they start showing other signs, like giving too much detail because they're trying to really prove that they're telling the truth.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, one of the most reliable ways to spot a lier is to pay attention to what they tell other people.  Many liers will freely admit to lying to someone else, especially if they think they were serving your interests by doing so.  The thing is, if they're willing to lie to someone else, they're willing to lie to you.","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_ta22","stickied":false,"subreddit":"science","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165077033,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3342-218b7ed2-2080-438c-9a97-384f011ca05d-1566236759"}

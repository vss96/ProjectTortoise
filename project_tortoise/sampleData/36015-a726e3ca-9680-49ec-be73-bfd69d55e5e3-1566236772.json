This chapter does order jews to kill any of their own people to try to draw others to other gods. So it seems as if, if I were a member of a jewish family but left judaism for some other religion and attempted to convert my family as well, they would be obligated to kill me. Didn't realize this passage was in there.\r\n\r\nI don't believe there are any similar passages in the new testament (i.e. meant for christians), but if there are, someone let me know.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166458761,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36015-a726e3ca-9680-49ec-be73-bfd69d55e5e3-1566236772"}

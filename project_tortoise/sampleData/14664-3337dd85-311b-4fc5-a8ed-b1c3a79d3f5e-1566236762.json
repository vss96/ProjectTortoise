The question is whether there is a consistent extension of rational arithmetic which is closed over the operation of dividing by zero. In other words, whether there is a set Q' = Q U {nullity} satisfying all the laws of rational arithmetic, where moreover x in Q' implies x/0 in Q'.\r\n\r\nSimply assigning another name to 0/0 is nothing; if 0/0 is not in Q', then you cannot add or multiply it by another number. Saying 0/0 is in Q' means you can, and is much stronger. In fact, as someone demonstrated [elsewhere](http://reddit.com/info/ty8s/comments/ctyj3), it makes the system inconsistent, since it isn't compatible with other laws like distributivity of multiplication over addition.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14664-3337dd85-311b-4fc5-a8ed-b1c3a79d3f5e-1566236762"}

In the original hours of the Consitutional Convention, know how much time was spent discussing civil liberties?\r\n\r\nFIFTEEN MINUTES!!  And *every* one was against them.\r\n\r\nIf Franklin, Jefferson, and Revere had not subverted Washington, Hamiliton, and Madison, we would have never even had a Bill of Rights!!@  That was only after several states led by the FJR coalition threatened immediate secession w/o Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nDid you not know Washington was \"elected\" without a vote 2 times, beforoe Franklin made it virtually impossible for Hamiliton to crown him King (allied w/ the British, of course)?\r\n\r\nDo you not know about the Original 13th Amendment, destroyed by the British in 1812, that would have made accepting any title or honour (such as Honourable Judge or Attorney Smith) a crime resulting in a stripped citizenry?\r\n\r\nNo of course not.  America was set up as a slave state, was hacked by FJR and has been under-seige ever since.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166719366,"ups":3,"score":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvmu9","id":"cvn5j","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"hopeseekr","retrieved_on":1473809122,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43467-e00bea0c-1cf6-4e22-8c9b-4478e86d549a-1566236774"}

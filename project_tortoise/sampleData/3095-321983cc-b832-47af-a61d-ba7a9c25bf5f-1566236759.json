ABOUT programming.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate upshot is that there's a very very large gap between knowing about programming and actually knowing about making software products that people can use. Now that gap is starting to show up in programmers themselves. Unfortunate.\r\n\r\nI suggest you bite into something you -really- like, and make the best of it.\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3095-321983cc-b832-47af-a61d-ba7a9c25bf5f-1566236759"}

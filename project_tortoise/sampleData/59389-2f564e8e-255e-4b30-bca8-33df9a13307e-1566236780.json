{"body":"1) Entering the vehicle w/o probable cause is violating Brett's rights. If he wanted to do a plain sight search, he could've done it with his flashlight outside the car. The behavior of the officer is questionable and suspicious -- at best.\r\n\r\n2) I've worked out with State Troopers. I call bullshit on your whole \"cops you conversation to judge state of mind, blah, blah, blah\" -- do you know any drunks? 14 shots into a night, and I'm mr. sociable -- no slurred speech, no wobble -- but I in no shape to drive. Alcohol effects all the muscles in your body, and as police officers know and are TRAINED TO LOOK for, the first thing they have to do is shine a flashlight in the guy's face, ask him to look left and look right. The muscles that control your eyes are the smallest and most affected by alcohol. \r\n\r\nIf your eyes \"bounce off the sides like basketballs\" (direct quote from state trooper) you're impaired. And congratulations, you've failed one of three impairment tests. Now you have to get out of the car and touch your nose, and blow into the breathalyzer. \r\n\r\nIf the officer wasn't a douche bag, he could've determined if the kid had be drinking IN LESS THAN 30 SECONDS, with NO two way communication and without having to have the kid GET OUT OF THE CAR. \r\n\r\nStill on the cop's side? 'cause just like the OJ book, I'm not buying it.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wgpl","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167526616,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"author":"redrobot5050","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cwi5i","parent_id":"t1_cwhcs","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809710,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59389-2f564e8e-255e-4b30-bca8-33df9a13307e-1566236780"}

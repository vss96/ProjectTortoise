The WoD has primed society to accept these sorts of abuses and now the WoT is exploiting our failings.\r\n\r\nAs a motorcyclist going back to the early 1970s I have watched our rights steadily eroded away as law enforcement cracked down on \"biker gangs\" (which didn't really exist in any meaningful context prior to the WoD).  I am sure other groups have had their own experiences along the same lines like the high-powered rocketry crowd who I know have come under ever tighter scrutiny by the BATF.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say the situation is worse today than it has ever been but the good news is that more and more people of the \"average man in the street\" variety are aware and beginning to get upset.  My neighbors are pretty average \"church going people\" but they are pretty upset with the WoD as it is clearly a failed policy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it is up to each of us who are aware of our diminishing freedoms to attempt to educate our neighbors about (1) what they are losing; (2) what the historical context is of what our rights are; (3) who is taking our rights away; and (4) what we can do about it (i.e., how to use the soap, ballot, jury, and ammo boxes).","link_id":"t3_tw0u","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13072-de4d6a02-e9c3-40e2-a805-2c449a3170b4-1566236762"}

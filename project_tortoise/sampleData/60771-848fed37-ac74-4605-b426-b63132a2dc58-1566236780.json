{"body":"I'm the original author of this story and I take offense to your statement.\r\n\r\nYes, signing statements have been around for a long time.  The difference is Bush uses the as Dictatorial Declarations, saying he will follow some laws how he feels like, if he feels like.  That is the text book definition of a Dictator.\r\n\r\nYou say that the US Constitution doesn't address signing statements, which is true, thus, they should not exist in the scope of Government since the Governments privileges are outlined in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAnd now Arlen Specter wants to legitimize the use of signing statements?  Just like he wanted to stop the surveillance program right?\r\n\r\nAnd you say Bush has only produced 108 signing statements?  I'm pretty sure it's much closer to 1000, though I'm not sure of the exact number.  I will look into this.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I hope you have a shitty new years, piss off.","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_whsy","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167600476,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jeff419","parent_id":"t1_cwkow","id":"cwkqu","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809758,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60771-848fed37-ac74-4605-b426-b63132a2dc58-1566236780"}

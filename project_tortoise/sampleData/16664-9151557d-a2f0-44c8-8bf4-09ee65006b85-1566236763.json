International affairs are not zero-sum.\r\n\r\nThe same criticism can be made of the economic arguments; just because china is growing, it doesn't mean american interests are in danger - unless you see american interests as simply \"being richer than everyone else\".","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16664-9151557d-a2f0-44c8-8bf4-09ee65006b85-1566236763"}

{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ufsk","subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"All these aesthetic terms do, but I'm saying, when people bring up the art/craft distinction, the only purpose it serves to advance a distinction between kinds of art which are considered advanced by society and those that are not. We in the West are almost willing to give tea ceremony the benefit of the doubt, but I haven't read any round eyes praising flower arranging as an \"art,\" yet it was considered one of the core arts of medieval Japan. Why? Because in the West, we've never had any artists who did something serious with flower arranging, so no one in the West takes it seriously. In Japan, no one took Hokusai seriously until after Van Gogh started ripping him off. Now, we all go back and look at the old Hokusai prints and see the genius that went unrecognized (because it was a mere craft) in its time. Even in the West, painting was a mere craft until the Renaissance, when they discovered how to paint with perspective and suddenly everybody thought, \"Wow, they're serious about this stuff.\"\r\n\r\nBasically anything humans do can be moved from a \"craft\" to an \"art\" if some genius decides to put enough effort into making it good.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165914794,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cujn6","edited":false,"id":"cujnv","author":"earthboundkid","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808375,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24404-16ab4f0b-13b5-4e92-aeaf-b9bb6748c414-1566236767"}

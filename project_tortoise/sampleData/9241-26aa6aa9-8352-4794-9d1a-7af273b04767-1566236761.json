Have you heard of hedge funds? Poor people don't get to invest in those.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that there are not some wealthy people who worked hard for their money. (I do think there's a strong case to be made that once you've made your fortune, you need not work as hard.) What I'm saying is that there are substantial social consequences to the concentration of wealth, and it is those consequences that should worry us when we hear about such shockingly unequal wealth distrubtion.\r\n\r\nIf you don't believe me, try this thought experiment. Imagine that instead of being born into your family, you were born into a wealthy family with, say, millions of dollars. Would you go to the same schools? Have the same friends? Would you date and marry the same people? Have the same career goals? Eat the same food? Listen to the same music? Wear the same clothes?

That's \"good\" for when both the driver and the passenger try to open a sliding door at the same time which can lead to a race condition until one person gives up.\r\n\r\nFinally, although there are the automatic safety interlocks mentioned above, the one which prevents the fuel cap from being ripped away from the body by the sliding door is manual.  On top of that, the door can still be opened manually, even when the safety is engaged.  The damage that is caused in such an accident costs thousands of dollars to repair as it ruins multiple body panels.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Honda has taken protecting us from ourselves to new heights (and lows) of stupidity.  It's just about enough to keep me from buying another Honda.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167603436,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60873-00b53314-7065-475c-a070-ae435a7c546b-1566236780"}

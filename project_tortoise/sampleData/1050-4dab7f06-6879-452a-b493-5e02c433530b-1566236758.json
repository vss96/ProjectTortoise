It actually could be the sign of an economy on the mend, undergoing a needed correction.\r\n\r\nOf course a weaker dollar is a sign of a weaker economy.  A weaker currency is only \"good\" in the sense that it may have some beneficial side effects, kind of like when you have the flu you might also lose weight.\r\n\r\nOne of those beneficial side effects, and I'm surprised no one here has mentioned it, is to decrease the size of the American debt.  America has a peculiar habit of running up huge debts, typically by building weapons and fighting wars, and then de facto defaulting on those debts by devaluing the dollar.","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1050-4dab7f06-6879-452a-b493-5e02c433530b-1566236758"}

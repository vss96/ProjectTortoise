The other two planes (Pentagon and Shanksville, PA) were 757-200s.\r\n\r\nMany people remember it being a 757 and 767. I’m not sure why, but it’s a common mistake.\r\n\r\nI’d like to think pilots could tell them apart (what do they do when ATC tells them “follow the 757” and there are several planes in the vicinity?). But many probably can’t tell the difference at a glance.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7209-ded2575d-26f8-40ae-aeb5-882a15441fa1-1566236760"}

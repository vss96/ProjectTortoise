{"body":"I'd argue that that definition actually reads \"general law\", \"general principle\" or \"general proposition\", which a statement about the non-existence of a particular word doesn't meet, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nParticularly, the process of generali[sz]ation involves going from something specific to something, well, more general.\r\n\r\nYou have something of a point regarding the absolute statement \"there is no word...\", but I would say that it's fairly thin - and certainly arguable - given the lack of recognition (or use) of the word. Given the thin-ness of your position, I didn't find the tone of your response appropriate. Which is why I appear to be arguing about unimportant things on the Internet.\r\n\r\nI'm glad you're happy to use Schadenfreude. I just wish I could spell it without copy-and-paste.\r\n","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vpsx","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166902650,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jbert","id":"cvv6i","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvukk","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809276,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47654-97d0cd4e-535b-4455-8597-c0e47cf27a3a-1566236775"}

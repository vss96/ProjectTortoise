The current code makes doing anything new with it very, very, very slow, and error prone.  It's nasty, from the 13000 line PHP files to the poorly designed database (for instance, one table that has a column containing csv delimited values...).  But, somehow, it works, except when you try and add new features, which takes weeks, and involves ghastly hacks, more often than not.\r\n\r\nSo... at what point do you say that there is enough of The Big Payback to undertake the Big Rewrite?\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809548,"gilded":0,"id":"cw9j6","parent_id":"t1_cw9cg","edited":false,"author":"davidw","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55105-2e8137e5-699e-404a-8d84-6d512db3730e-1566236779"}

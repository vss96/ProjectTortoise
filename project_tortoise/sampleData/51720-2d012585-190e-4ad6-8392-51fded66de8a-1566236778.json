{"body":"These people need something else to do, blaming video games for addiction and violence is ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\"Symptom: Teen spends many hours in front of the computer\r\nThis is the most classic sign of gaming addiction. A teen spends the majority of his free time indoors on the computer, only taking breaks for snacks and the bathroom. This behavior is commonly known as \"grinding\" and \"farming,\" and typically lasts several hours to an entire evening. In the most extreme cases, it may lead to an out-of-control 24 hour gaming binge.\"","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w38l","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1167168408,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"johnnynada","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cw38p","parent_id":"t3_w38l","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809428,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51720-2d012585-190e-4ad6-8392-51fded66de8a-1566236778"}

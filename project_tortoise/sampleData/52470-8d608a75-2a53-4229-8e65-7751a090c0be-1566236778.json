The difference is in your insinuating that the situation has to do more with their being of a different type than their belonging to the common class of the poor.\r\n\r\n'This is in a part of the world where people keenly appraise the abilities of their kids to serve as beggars.'\r\n\r\nThat sentence is a world of a difference away from your now watered down claim about only pointing out how poor people behave.\r\n\r\nYou are being sneaky in tying in a common financial incentive with a certain class of people, where class has nothing do with financial status.\r\n\r\nIt is amateurish to find a plausible explanation and then sneak in a causality argument anchoring that explanation. \r\n\r\nAll this crap aside, explain to people what you mean by people from 'that part of the world' appraising a situation thus. And back that up with a reference and also a counter telling us why people elsewhere behave differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167201443,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52470-8d608a75-2a53-4229-8e65-7751a090c0be-1566236778"}

{"body":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_generations\r\n\r\nI'm glad to see that I'm not the only one of the \"Demonseed\" generation who's had enough of the narcissistic boommers.  This has happened before with the \"Lost\" generation.  They were called crap by their self-obsessed parents who followed the trends of the day which was mainly blaming the children for their own issues.\r\n\r\n\"Baby on board\" - more like \"Baby in the trunk\" in the 1970's when GenX was getting neglected and Boomers were hoping the exorcist would come in and save them from their horrible children.\r\n\r\nThe greatest people nowadays aren't even Boomers - Murtha is the Silent generation (so was Jimi Hendrix).  I've had enough of these commercials for these Boomers who refuse to grow up - not old but up.\r\n\r\nOh well, GenX will be pragmatic and clean up your indulgent mess b/c we learned pragmatism while you got your divorces and \"found\" yourselves and called us the spoiled ones.

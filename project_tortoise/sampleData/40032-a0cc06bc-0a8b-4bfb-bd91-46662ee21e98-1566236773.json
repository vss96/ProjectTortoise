If a) exceeds b), you're wrong. If b) exceeds a), everyone who deals with any banks, brokers, or other merchants is wrong.\r\n\r\nWhich is more likely?\r\n\r\n&gt;To the extent they improve returns for their clients, it's mostly either luck, dishonesty, or salesmanship\r\n\r\nNow you're onto something! Here's what I think: they're in the therapy business. They're in the business of giving people a shot at feeling that they've done the best they can, *and* giving them someone to blame when things go wrong. That's worth something. Or it's not, in which case you can use a discount broker and keep your cash buried in  a backyard -- it works for some people, though for a group that's collectively avoiding the alleged bad bargain of the financial industry, they don't seem especially rich.\r\n\r\n&gt;But the value of those markets seems widely out of proportion to the rewards delivered to their operators and agents.\r\n\r\nAgain, the agents are only rewarded one transaction at a time, and they all compete with each other, so this requires a pretty complicated conspiracy along with some collective insanity.","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40032-a0cc06bc-0a8b-4bfb-bd91-46662ee21e98-1566236773"}

Much of my family is Jewish, but they live in NY, and L.A.  I am part Jewish as is my wife (though in both cases our mothers were non-Jews, so neither of us is technically Jewish, it's fun explaining this to the kids).  We don't go suppressing Palestinians or attacking the Lebanese.\r\n\r\nIf you want to complain about the Jewish Israelis who currently hold power, then you are quite right to do so, but please don't go blaming all Jews for the actions of those bastards.  At every family gathering arguments about Israel come up and we always wind up divided between the crazy conservative hardliners who really do think that the Palestinians are to blame and that the Jews are their victims.  But arguing with them are other Jews in our family who are very liberal and very opposed to the occupation and the behavior.  \r\n\r\nDon't blame all the Jews for the horrible acts some Israelis have committed.  By the same logic all Americans should be blamed for what Bush has done (and I'd be screwed again).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v1y6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808778,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_cv4xc","edited":false,"id":"cv56i","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34500-84587b0a-d7d9-4239-a8e2-c8da947f34c0-1566236771"}

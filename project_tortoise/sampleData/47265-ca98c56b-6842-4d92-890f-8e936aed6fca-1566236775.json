However, I don't think that I will ever move from XML to JSON for client chatter.  If other people want to use it, cool.  It is an elegant solution for its problem domain.\r\n\r\nBut everything I work with is multi-platform, multi-language, etc,  and a JS-centric protocol would harm more than help.\r\n\r\nBut Mike's critiques of many of the w3.org and omg.org XML specs are correct.  They are overengineered to the point of impracticality.  WSDL is practically unreadable.  XMI (not 'ell') should have been a godsend as a replacement for IDL.  Have you tried reading an XMI file?  Impossible.  XML Schema is more work than it is worth.  One of the ones with which I have worked, XPath, recently had a 2.0 release which is so horribly bloated as to be unimplementable by anything other than a corporate code shop.\r\n\r\nBut there are bright points.  A couple of examples:  Mike mentioned XML-RPC.  That is the simplified, easy-to-implement protocol that stole the 'S' from SOAP.  Relax-NG so easily beats Schema and DTDs for clarity and simplicity.\r\n","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166884900,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47265-ca98c56b-6842-4d92-890f-8e936aed6fca-1566236775"}

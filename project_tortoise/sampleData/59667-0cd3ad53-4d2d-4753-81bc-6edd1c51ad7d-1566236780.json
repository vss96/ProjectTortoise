This warning may be turned off by default in some compilers, but I'm pretty sure most compilers have it. Using the warning would certainly be a nicer solution than using his ugly FPSCompare functions. \r\n\r\nThose functions, BTW, are badly named.  They should be called \"IsEqual\". Comparison functions typically return a value saying whether one value is equal to, less than, or greater than another value.\r\n\r\n\"if (FPSCompareInt(x, y))\" doesn't read as good, declarative English. \"if (IsEqualInt(x, y))\" would make much more sense. \r\n","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167539621,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t1_cwh3b","edited":false,"id":"cwimv","author":"dangph","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809718,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59667-0cd3ad53-4d2d-4753-81bc-6edd1c51ad7d-1566236780"}

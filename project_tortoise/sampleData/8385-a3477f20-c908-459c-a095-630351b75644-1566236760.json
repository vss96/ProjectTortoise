He's got a bunch of graphs and no mention of the methodology used to come up with them.\r\n\r\n...however, most of us do suspect that the goverment has been painting a much rosier economic picuture than what is reality. The way that inflation is measured has been tweaked a lot in recent years and I wouldn't at all be surprised if the real inflation rate was somewhere closer to 10% than it is to 3%.  I also suspect that the real unemployment numbers are probably much higher than the reported 4.6%.  But those are just suspicions; I wouldn't attempt to draw up some graphs based upon them.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tkec","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8385-a3477f20-c908-459c-a095-630351b75644-1566236760"}

I'm in the process of teaching myself Python, Ruby,SQL and shell scripting.  I want to try my hand at a compiled language too but have no interest in C++ and have been warned about trying to learn C without a good teacher.  As far as I can tell Objective-C has all of C's benefits and is OO as well.  Most sources I've researched recommend a prior familiarity with C but I've found a book, Programming in Objective-C (Paperback)\r\nby Stephen Kochan, that is meant for folks like me who want to learn obj-c without really knowing C.  Since I've not met anyone else who's taking this approach, I'd like to tap into the collective wisdom of reddit. \r\n\r\nWhy is Obj-C not more popular and am I making a bad choice in trying to pick up this language? \r\n","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1166821333,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46169-21a5e619-cd22-4314-9f67-cd51c5b025c3-1566236775"}

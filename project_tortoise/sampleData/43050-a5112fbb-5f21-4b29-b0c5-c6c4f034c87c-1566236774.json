You actually need new syntax for this?\r\n\r\nIn Common Lisp you don't of course define new syntaxes or anything to do something this simple. But if you want to really decorate your functions/methods you do [method combination](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/07_ff.htm)\r\n\r\n[7.6.6.2 Standard Method Combination](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/07_ffb.htm) has *before* *after* and *around* method combinations.\r\n \r\n[Built-in Method Combination Types](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/07_ffd.htm)  are: +    append  max  nconc  progn  and  list    min  or     standard. \r\n\r\nFor example, if you call generic function that has max method combination, all combined methods are executed and the one with maximum numeric value is returned. You can define your own method combinations too. If this is not decoration then what is?","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vie8","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809105,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"t1_cvjdx","id":"cvm9n","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43050-a5112fbb-5f21-4b29-b0c5-c6c4f034c87c-1566236774"}

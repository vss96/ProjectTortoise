I did not infer that all americans were like that. I think from your reply, that you seem to think I did, and you seem to assume that I've only ever seen america through the media. you are, of course, wrong on both counts.\r\n\r\none last thing, I'm a brit, living in NZ. Kiwis on the whole are a bit nicer than me. Why is it that americans are unable to accept criticism of one part of america without taking it as a personal attack? Possibly the same mindset that is ready to judge NZ just becuase one person who lives there is willing to post views you disagree with on an internet board.\r\n\r\nFFS I attacked the ignorant capslock fucker, and you take it as an attack on your whole country. What you gonna do, drop bombs on me?\r\n\r\nIf you want people from other countries to be nicer to americans, then vote in an administration that doesn't start wars, doesn't lock up huge numbers of it's own people, doesn't torture, doesn't bully others. Or are you still pissed that little ole New Zealand won't let you park your nukes here?","controversiality":0,"ups":6,"score":6,"created_utc":1165822607,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21796-53620375-b169-422e-b568-8a5442308dbd-1566236766"}

About twelve years ago, for fun, I wrote a recursive function to solve the problem for an arbitrary number of balls.","link_id":"t3_ueqk","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808391,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"fandango","edited":false,"id":"cukj8","parent_id":"t3_ueqk","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24758-cc1c2236-75f8-4507-be9c-8991a6a218a0-1566236767"}

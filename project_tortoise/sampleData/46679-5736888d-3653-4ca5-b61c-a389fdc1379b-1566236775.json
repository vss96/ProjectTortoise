If you're looking at doing application development then something like python is more expressive, or you get better libraries in java (and Apple itself moved the NeXT-developed WebObjects away from Objective C and to Java - version 5.0 was pure java). But if you're looking at doing performance intensive stuff you're better off with C or even something else weird like ocaml.\r\n\r\nThe only area I can think of where ObjectiveC is the best of breed is for Mac OS X-based software development. Which is a pretty cool area to be in, but still relatively obscure compared to Web Development (the bigggie - in which java is the clear leader), Windows Development (although is there much of that going on these days?) or embedded programming.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_vs9v","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166840089,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46679-5736888d-3653-4ca5-b61c-a389fdc1379b-1566236775"}

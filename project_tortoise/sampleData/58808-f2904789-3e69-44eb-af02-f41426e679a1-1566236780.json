The only reason it looks so nice on the surface because they had a culture of keeping up appearances... they were *British*, we used to be all about keeping up appearances, stiff upper lip, etc.\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria collected pictures of male nudes, and gave one to her husband. Bathing machines were less likely to have been seen than women going to the water naked. It's true they didn't overtly talk about sex, [they did talk about it though](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_flowers).

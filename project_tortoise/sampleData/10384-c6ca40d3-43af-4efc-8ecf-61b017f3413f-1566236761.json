I was a search engine marketing guy in a very small agency. Everyone there worked from 9-6, I got paid hourly. Every day I'd wake up at 5:30, get ready for the long commute, start at 9, leave at 6 and be home by 7 (traffic was much less at night). By 9 I'd be ready for bed. 2 hours of personal time a day just isn't enough to make life worth living.\r\n\r\nI typically could finish all of my days work by 2PM. The rest would be me trying to think of reasonably productive things to do, but none of them were really all that important. It's frustrating knowing that you can be just as productive and have some kind of personal life as well, but would end up making half the money. It gave me a very negative view of the corporate world, but reading this has given me some hope about the future.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807854,"gilded":0,"id":"ctrw5","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_toqx","author_flair_text":null,"author":"dannyhw","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10384-c6ca40d3-43af-4efc-8ecf-61b017f3413f-1566236761"}

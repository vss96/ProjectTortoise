He claims that powershell is cool because it uses .NET objects and can do cool things like mixing commands that plain text couldn't do : \r\n\r\n\"If we were to pipe the results of the first \"dir\" command in a text-based shell, we could refactor it to a list, but we wouldn't be able to show any data elements that aren't in the original output, nor could we make the common data elements show more detail.\"\r\nI bet he never used any unix shell in his life..\r\n\r\nAs say Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in http://www.artima.com/intv/plain.html :\r\n\"Another reason for using plain text is it allows you to write individual chunks of code that cooperate with each other. One of the classic examples of this is the Unix toolset: a set of small sharp tools that you can join together. You join them by feeding the plain text output of one into the plain text input of the next. There's no concept of trying to make sure the word count program outputs things in a format that's compatible with the next tool in the chain. It's just plain text to plain text, and that's a very powerful way to do it.\"","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809673,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cwg7a","parent_id":"t3_wg1f","author":"Monkeyget","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58511-6720a7b7-21c7-4d7e-a42f-ad83103ecaad-1566236780"}

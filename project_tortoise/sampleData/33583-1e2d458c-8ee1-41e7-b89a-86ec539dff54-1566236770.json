{"body":"Downvoted for: \r\n\r\n1. Misleading title - MPAA doesn't have \"users\", and other than identifying P2P services as one way to obtain pirated movies, how is the MPAA helping piracy?\r\n2. Article doesn't identify the source of quoted material.  If you want, you can find some of it [here](http://www.mpaa.org/piracy_internet.asp) and [here](http://www.mpaa.org/piracy_IDmaterials.asp).  I wasn't able to find the stereo stealing quote.\r\n3. Quotes are taken out of context. The first set of quotes are from a page titled: \"HOW CAN I TELL WHETHER A MOVIE IS PIRATED?\"  The P2P info is from a section called \"WHAT IS INTERNET PIRACY?\"  It's not like they have a \"tips\" page called \"How to download pirated movies on the internets.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to back the MPAA here.  I think their anti-piracy efforts are misguided and laughable.  \r\n\r\nI just find this article misleading and dishonest.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v2u8","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":6,"score":6,"created_utc":1166344238,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"emiller40","edited":false,"id":"cv3cs","parent_id":"t3_v2u8","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808744,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33583-1e2d458c-8ee1-41e7-b89a-86ec539dff54-1566236770"}

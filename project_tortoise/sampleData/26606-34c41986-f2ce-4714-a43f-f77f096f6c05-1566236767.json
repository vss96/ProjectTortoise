For evolution to occur, there must be genetic mutation and selection. Here, we seem to have some lions who adopted some new tactics to hunt buffalo. Some of those tactics failed, causing one pride to nearly die out. Still, lions are more adaptable than previously thought. \r\n\r\nI don't know why they became more muscular though.

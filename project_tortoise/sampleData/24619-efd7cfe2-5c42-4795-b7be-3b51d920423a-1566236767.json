It is pretty much right on target, and someone with your apparent standing in the smart blog community, with a large readership, can perhaps have some effect saying it, I hope. The criticism \"who is this for anyway\" is silly; the art world is seriously ill and really needs a large dose of this kind of common sense. \r\n\r\nThe other comments here (I have not read them all; they fall into a predictable pattern) are more or less the same anywhere these fundamental questions are posed.

I think that kids are more able to imagine themselves becoming an astronaut if they see someone who **looks** like them.  If astronauts were always white men, then girls and black kids would maybe not even think they could ever be an astronaut.\r\n\r\nSo, I think it seems like an important goal to make sure there is at least some diversity for astronauts - for the children's sake.  I don't think the exact ratio needs to be the same as the US population, but there should be an effort.\r\n\r\n(Although their photos are not exactly on the front page of newspapers or on TV anymore, so maybe they are not the role models they used to be).\r\n\r\n------ edit: added this ----\r\n\r\nAnother reason to have a diverse group of astronauts is so that white men (and white boys) don't think that only they have the ability to do the most difficult things.","controversiality":0,"score":-9,"ups":-9,"created_utc":1166119311,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cusfp","parent_id":"t3_us2a","edited":false,"author":"brfox","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808537,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28383-28624d4e-4b89-43c8-84db-fd11cd2df376-1566236768"}

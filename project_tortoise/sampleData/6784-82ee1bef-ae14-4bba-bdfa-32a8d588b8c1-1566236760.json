It's been said before, but I'm pretty fed up by the anti-American sentiment by entertainers who made their millions pandering to those Americans.\r\n\r\nAnyway, were I to speculate as to why Gwyneth would think this, it's probably that she was born into America and adopted England.  She didn't have much choice about the circumstances in her American life (especially early on), but she was allowed to exclusively choose her British environs.  Somebody born into regular old classless Britain and then getting to choose the best that America has to offer might think the opposite (how many wealthy foreigners stay in NYC, e.g.).\r\n\r\nAnother celebrity giving worthless, unqualified commentary in trying to be relevant.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tk2b","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6784-82ee1bef-ae14-4bba-bdfa-32a8d588b8c1-1566236760"}

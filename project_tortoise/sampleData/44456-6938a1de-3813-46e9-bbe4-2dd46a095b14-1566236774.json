{"body":"\"Ontology\" is for philosophers, doing meta-physics. Knowing the \"true nature of being\" for something like an electron or space-time is irrelevant to creating a theoretical physical model to make predictions. \r\n\r\nPhysicists are about looking at things in the real world and understanding what rules govern their behavior. There is no way known, other than Quantum Mechanics, to confidently predict the behavior of atomic systems. Back in 1930, you could maintain there might be something fishy about the foundation of quantum mechanics. Here in 2006, you have to realize that quantum mechanics works, and no comparable alternative exists.\r\n\r\nThe wavefunction is a computational means to an end: computing what a hydrogen atom will do when you shine light on it, for instance. It does not claim to be the explanation of what it means in a metaphysical sense for an electron to exist, or the nature of conscious awareness of the electron, just to predict the outcome of experiments. Which it does very well. \r\n\r\nJust as Newton did not claim (\"I frame no hypotheses\") to understand the true nature of universal gravitation, but simply found that the assumption of such a law could be used to compute the behavior of the moon, the planets, apples falling from trees, the tides, and so on.\r\n\r\nPhilosophical bullshit about the \"conscious mind of the observer\" and Schroedinger's cat as some great mystery is useless and bad philosophy. It isn't physics. And it doesn't mean physicists are full of shit when they claim QM works.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vk0o","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166741227,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"sickofthisshit","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvow6","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvotg","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809156,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44456-6938a1de-3813-46e9-bbe4-2dd46a095b14-1566236774"}

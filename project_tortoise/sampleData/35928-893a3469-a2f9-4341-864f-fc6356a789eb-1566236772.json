The vast majority of Muslims are not terrorists. Therefore, if you see Muslims praying, the probability of them being terrorists is negligible.  Furthermore, if they really were terrorists, they wouldn't do things like kneeling down in the middle of the airport terminal to draw attention to themselves.  So I'd say if a group of Muslim men kneeled down and started praying in the middle of an airport terminal, they would almost certainly not be terrorists, and no rational person would be in any way frightened.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_v7ee","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166456662,"score":38,"ups":38,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"35928-893a3469-a2f9-4341-864f-fc6356a789eb-1566236772"}

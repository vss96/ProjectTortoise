Like, if I'm translating from English to Japanese, the wizard will have to ask, \"When you say 'close the door,' you mean a Western style door, right?\" since Japanese style doors have a different name and verb for \"to close\" in Japanese. You could make a program that can untangle stuff like that between two languages, maybe, but to make it work for every single language would be hard as hell.","controversiality":0,"ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165735150,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cub0y","parent_id":"t1_cuals","edited":false,"author":"earthboundkid","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808211,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19808-342eff5d-1656-46f9-96dc-a5a1c0614c8c-1566236764"}

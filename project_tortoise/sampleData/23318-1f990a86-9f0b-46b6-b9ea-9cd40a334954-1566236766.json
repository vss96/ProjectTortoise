But the fact that they are not exploitative of every opportunity to turn a buck, even obvious ones is what has the business community perplexed.  Ad revenue is a no-brainer from a bottom line stand point.  It's going to generate positive income.  But management does not make decisions based on the bottom line.\r\n\r\nCommunist is definitely the wrong word for such a philosophy.  They're just independent thinkers.  They have a vision of what they want the business to be, and they are happy with it being that, and nothing more, and all of the \"upside\" in the world isn't going to have them stray from this vision.  I wouldn't call such a position admirable, it just is what it is, a different way to approach business.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ug5r","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23318-1f990a86-9f0b-46b6-b9ea-9cd40a334954-1566236766"}

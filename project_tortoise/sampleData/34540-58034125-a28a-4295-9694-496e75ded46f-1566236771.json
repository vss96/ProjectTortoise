According to wikipedia, these particles do not move \"faster than light\", they move faster than light does in that particular medium, not faster than light in a vacuum.  Once I looked up the wikipedia explanation I reread the NY Times statement and saw that they are saying the same thing, but it's uses a very misleading wording that initially made me raise my eyebrow and question the accuracy of anything the rest of the article said.  It's not a big deal, but it's worth clarifying.","link_id":"t3_v57v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34540-58034125-a28a-4295-9694-496e75ded46f-1566236771"}

Specifically, the conflict resolution for eager versioning.  All the updating and buffering is NOT atomic, and thus you are prone to getting a non-coherent set of data, plus you can't full verify before a commit.\r\n\r\nE.g. say I'm messing with variables A, B, C, and D.  I update them, then check them all, and then commit.  The problem is that as soon as I check A, another process might change it, same with B, C, D.  So I can write them, verify them, yet I can end up committing an incorrect transaction.\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808309,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_uc0l","edited":false,"id":"cug9j","author_flair_text":null,"author":"lemmikins","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22553-3d2bc614-6207-4210-9238-0734445869a7-1566236766"}

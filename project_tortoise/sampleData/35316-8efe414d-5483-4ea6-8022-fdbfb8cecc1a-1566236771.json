{"controversiality":0,"body":"Nono, absolute zero is absolute, not relative. A few degrees kelvin means that everything still has a little energy. Absolute zero means nothing has any energy at all.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the present model the universe would only approach absolute zero. There would always be some infinitesimal energy in the system (assuming it's not quantized... hrm...) so stuff would still be happening, just on a smaller, slower scale.","link_id":"t3_v0hl","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166425021,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cv6ou","parent_id":"t1_cv6ii","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808807,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35316-8efe414d-5483-4ea6-8022-fdbfb8cecc1a-1566236771"}

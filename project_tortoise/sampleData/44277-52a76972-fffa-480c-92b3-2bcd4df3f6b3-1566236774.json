{"body":"I've done this myself as a former delivery driver for a pizza company. A good driver will always load his things so he accomplishes a good clockwise circle. Sometimes its even faster to make a clockwise loop even if you have just one stop a quarter into the loop.\r\n\r\nGoing clockwise also opens up options if you hit traffic or some other obstacle... Stuck behind a city bus? Take the next right into that suburb.\r\n\r\nThey didn't cover this in training but its one of those things you pick up from more experienced drivers.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vn5e","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166735919,"score":15,"ups":15,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"stevarino","parent_id":"t1_cvnzo","id":"cvok2","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809151,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44277-52a76972-fffa-480c-92b3-2bcd4df3f6b3-1566236774"}

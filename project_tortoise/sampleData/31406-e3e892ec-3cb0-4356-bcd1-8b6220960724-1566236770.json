{"controversiality":1,"body":"Well, tha article wasn't a review of a work by Falwell and that whole crew, was it? So why should it single them out? \r\n\r\nAnd he's not even at the 'fight you' stage, is he? Most establishment people could care less what Dawkins thinks.\r\n\r\nI'd place him in the same category as Falwell. Just because he's anti-religion doesn't mean he's different than all the other fundamentatlists. Falwell hates gays, Dawkins hates religionists. Anyone who calls for the death of people who don't 'think right' are all the same to me: dangerous fundamentatlists.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uyar","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1166216986,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dell","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuyd5","id":"cuymp","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808654,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31406-e3e892ec-3cb0-4356-bcd1-8b6220960724-1566236770"}

I worked in the tee shirt screenprinting industry for a while and realized that basically, the people ordering the shirts don't care about what people will like as long as they can get the most shirts at the cheapest price.  Those big, cotton shirts are the cheapest and easiest to buy in bulk and are produced by the huge wholesalers. The better designed, better fitting shirts have much lower demand and tend to be made by more of the niche-market wholesalers like Ameican Apparel that care about design and comfort. But these are really expensive as you would expect and conventions that give away \"free\" shirts usually just want to save a couple of bucks. \r\n\r\nI've printed over a thousand mastercard shirts, all size large, and all of a really shoddy quality.  I made about the same number of paypal shirts once but they sprung for the pricier 50/50 shirts in varying sizes.  I was proud of them and took home a size small for my scrawny frame.  They should just give you an iron on transfer and 5 bucks for the purchase of a shirt if they are just going to order bunch of cheap shirts that 90% of people will find ill fitting and hideous.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_v4hp","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808777,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Owlie","parent_id":"t3_v4hp","id":"cv55d","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34480-b7e99abc-2c56-45f8-91b8-75c068cff618-1566236771"}

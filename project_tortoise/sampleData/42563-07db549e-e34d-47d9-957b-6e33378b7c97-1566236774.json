Mazl tov, by the way.\r\n\r\nHowever, you should refrain from vitriol against Christians.  Remember, none hates his old religion and loves his new one like a convert, and that doesn't exclude converts to atheism (or whatever you are now).  It's just a psychological fact.\r\n\r\nmangleon has tried (and failed, since he requires insults with which to argue) to make the point that many people see only evil in Israel.  Many people also only see evil in the United States, Iran, North Korea, or the Arab world.  People need to not only read positive stories about Iran or negative stories about Israel, but all the stories they can find before they can call themselves informed.  Real life is one huge gray area.\r\n\r\nIMHO, Israel is a nice and *necessary* country full mostly of good people which has done some very evil things because they can't relax enough to get out of \"danger - fight or flight?\" reactions.  However, their Arab neighbors and the Palestinians have attacked them using terror.  In that manner, the Arabs have goaded the Israelis into striking at them.\r\n\r\nThe only thing capable of defeating terrorism is courage, and Israel doesn't seem to have enough of it to fight *when necessary and only when necessary*.  The United States and Europe, by the way, have even less courage in the face of terrorism.","retrieved_on":1473809083,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvl3s","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvkip","author_flair_text":null,"author":"EliGottlieb","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42563-07db549e-e34d-47d9-957b-6e33378b7c97-1566236774"}

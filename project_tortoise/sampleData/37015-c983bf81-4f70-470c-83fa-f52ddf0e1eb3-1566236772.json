{"controversiality":0,"body":"If it were true that the SS system paid out much less than was paid in, there wouldn't be any problem with the finances!\r\n\r\nThe problem is exactly the opposite: that the typical retiree gets (perhaps slightly) more out of the system than the value of his contributions over his working life.\r\n\r\nThis should not be confused with the GWB sleight-of-hand which claims that a worker could invest his contributions in T bonds and get his own retirement funded risk-free, so we can junk SS; that only works because that worker is not doing what is needed to pay *today's* retirees. Nor should it be confused with the possibility that GWB and the other baby boomers will screw the system up so bad that nothing will be left for today's 20-somethings.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v8uv","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166482518,"author":"sickofthisshit","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cva5i","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv9om","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808871,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37015-c983bf81-4f70-470c-83fa-f52ddf0e1eb3-1566236772"}

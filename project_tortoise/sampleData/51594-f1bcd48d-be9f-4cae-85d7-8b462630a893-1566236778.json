I don't remember if the example provided one.\r\n\r\nSecond, if you swing a rope over your head, it's relatively easy to keep it spinning without much trouble.\r\n\r\nThe laser example that provides power isn't my first choice for providing lift, but keeping it focused on the moving structure can be done via negative feedback.  This isn't really much of a concept killer.\r\n\r\nThe space elevator isn't necessarily rigid either.  As long as the laser can stay focused on the elevator, the elevator structure can flex without a problem.  Most of the reason buildings flex is to prevent positive feedback rather than from risk of snapping in the first gale.  You're confusing buildings with trees that snap in high winds.\r\n\r\nI don't believe there's as much risk of positive feedback with the space elevator as there is with a building or a bridge.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge for an example of positive feedback)","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vz0r","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809424,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nosoupforyou","id":"cw2zf","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw0ep","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51594-f1bcd48d-be9f-4cae-85d7-8b462630a893-1566236778"}

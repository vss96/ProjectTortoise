I'll only say this about the subject: there have been many instances where people have survived only after a few have ventured out together to get help, but it's always a bad idea to go out on your own. However, given the circumstances he was in, it really doesn't come as surprising as to what he did. I'm sure, had he known the outcome of his story and having survival training (which most of us lack) would certainly have aided him in making a better decision so to say - but he did what he did, I am sure in the best interest of his family and in desperation. I saw some of Kim's reviews on Cnet and was quite pleased with him as tech reviewer. Too bad what happened to him, my condolences to his family.","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13272-262adbee-3b53-48e0-86df-bc5232492515-1566236762"}

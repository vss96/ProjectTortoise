I think two things have been directly attributable to the change.\r\n\r\n- How to Win Friends and Influence People (From Introvert to Extravert)\r\n\r\n- Functional programming (From Sensing to Intuition-- the T/F and J/P are much more balanced, as well)\r\n\r\nThe second one, in particular is very interesting.

My college has smoking restricted areas outside, which is just insane because there's a vast difference between someone smoking near you inside and someone smoking near you outside, namely the fact that it clears within a few seconds or less outside.\r\n\r\nI have friends that smoke, and I have no problem with them smoking around me. Why should I? Apparently because they have a vice, well I crack my joints 24/7, I've drink enough caffine that I swear my body actually synthesises it in my body now. I have a list of personal faults longer than my arms combined, I *am* a personality disorder.\r\n\r\nI believe everyone has a huge list of disgusting personal habits and I don't judge them on them because it's hypocritical. The only time I've ever felt uncomfortable around people smoking was when I was playing poker with my girlfriends family, the game went on for about 4 hours and my eyes started hurting from the persistant smoke, however I won so I can't really complain or Karma will bitch slap me.","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1165780811,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cucnr","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuc71","author_flair_text":null,"author":"electromagnetic","retrieved_on":1473808242,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20617-fc8a26d0-76f2-4020-ab64-580f2ed795bd-1566236765"}

{"body":"\"Ah now I understand why the modern pop audiences love fugues and counterpoint.\r\n\r\nThere's no 'bound' about it.

A major difference, though, is that modern music can get there allot more quickly, which is the point I'm making about modern audiences.  Modern audiences are incredibly sophisticated and can catch on to complex musical structure that would baffle people a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nEdit:  Yay, a negative score.  Either I said something too profound or insanely stupid.  I'll let it be a mystery.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tn3v","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-9,"ups":-9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165318491,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctoa8","edited":false,"id":"ctohm","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807790,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8705-27b55b1a-4b7b-48f4-9a41-7978f30daf8f-1566236760"}

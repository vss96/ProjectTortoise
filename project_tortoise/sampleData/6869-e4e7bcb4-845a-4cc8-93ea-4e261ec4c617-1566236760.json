{"body":"Newspapers and magazines use columns because it has been proven that line widths maximize at a certain point to be effective.  At a certain line length, the reader often loses place on which line he is on, potentially skipping lines or reading the same line twice.\r\n\r\nColumn width should be fixed, and screen size independent, because many people (myself included) are using widescreen LCD's.  I have a 24\" widescreen, and a line that is 80-90% of the screen width would be very hard to read, as I would be losing my place constantly.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tjeu","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1165251330,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"kermityfrog","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctju7","id":"ctkly","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807716,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6869-e4e7bcb4-845a-4cc8-93ea-4e261ec4c617-1566236760"}

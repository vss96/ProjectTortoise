Sheer geographic area certainly matters, but not all acres are equal.  Population and resources count more.  Islam dominating vast areas of desert does not equal Christendom's holdings.  To this day Muslims fantasize about the glory days of [al Andalus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Andalus).  Would you rather live in Spain or the [Arabian peninsula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_peninsula)?  Muslim scholars now say that Allah blessed their lands, but it wasn't apparent until the discovery of oil, which took Westerners to develop.  \r\n\r\nFurther, the map does not accurately reflect the reach of Christianity throughout history.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166638021,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cviou","parent_id":"t1_cvh8d","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"degustibus","retrieved_on":1473809036,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41309-33eeac1b-98a8-43fe-b9d6-d84390b433d1-1566236773"}

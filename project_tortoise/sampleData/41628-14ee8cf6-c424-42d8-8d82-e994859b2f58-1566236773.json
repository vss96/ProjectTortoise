{"body":"True, but the problem is in determining what is correct or not. Economists cannot perform experiments or even quasi-experiments at large scales. There are no independent variables to manipulate isolated from other factors, so all research must be correlational or archival in nature. This runs into serious issues of confounds and third variables. Economists create models to try and explain what they see, but there's always the danger their models resemble the old theory of planetary epicycles (i.e., frequently descriptive, but occasionally very wrong, and operating under incorrect assumptions such as that the earth is the center of the solar system and not the sun.)\r\n\r\nEven at small scales, though, many economists don't run experiments, which I think is a massive mistake of the field. If they'd done that, they might be thinking more critically of using game theory to try to interpret human behavior. \r\n\r\nI've been following the new field of neuroeconomics very closely, and I think it bears a lot of promise for the beginnings of making economics into a real science.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vcvm","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166644909,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"pihkal","edited":false,"id":"cvjc0","parent_id":"t1_cvfs9","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809050,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41628-14ee8cf6-c424-42d8-8d82-e994859b2f58-1566236773"}

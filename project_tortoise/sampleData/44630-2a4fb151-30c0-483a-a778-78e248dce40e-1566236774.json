{"body":"Good description. If I understand you correctly you are saying that the free will is the feedback loop of our mind where by it continuously modifies itself based on it's own outputs.\r\n\r\nI don't think I object to that definition of free will. \r\n\r\nWhat I do object to is the idea many people seem to have that the will somehow stands apart from causality. As if it where a magical thing interacting with the universe from some alternate plane of existence.\r\n\r\nI think based on your description I will no longer refer to free will as incoherent (I merely view any definition which ignores causality as absurd). Though, I will probably still refrain from using the term simply because it is so often misunderstood.\r\n\r\nEdit: btw, bonus points for the \"Children of Dune\" reference. Haven't read it yet, but I loved \"Dune\".","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vf8l","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166747219,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"djwhitt","edited":false,"id":"cvp86","parent_id":"t1_cvofs","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809164,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44630-2a4fb151-30c0-483a-a778-78e248dce40e-1566236774"}

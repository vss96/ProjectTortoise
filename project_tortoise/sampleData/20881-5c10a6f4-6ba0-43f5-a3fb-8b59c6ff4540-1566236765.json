{"controversiality":0,"body":"The 80:20 rule applies to readability.  If you want to talk about time taken, then &lt;strong&gt; is *better* than &lt;b&gt;, because it's quicker to find in a large block of HTML text when you're debugging.  But that's not the point.\r\n\r\nAs has been said elsewhere, the reasons not to ban &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and the rest in favour of &lt;span class=\"...\"&gt; are:\r\n\r\n* They work on non-CSS-enabled browsers (this is the biggie).\r\n* They have a semantic meaning: a book title is properly displayed in italics; lacking a &lt;booktitle&gt; tag, this means that &lt;i&gt; has this meaning, among others.  Complaining that &lt;i&gt; is overloaded is like refusing to use the word \"set\" in everyday speech because it has a godzillion different dictionary definitions.\r\n* Religious fundamentalism is always, without exception, evil.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u9w3","subreddit":"programming","ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1165788719,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cud36","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuc2i","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808249,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20881-5c10a6f4-6ba0-43f5-a3fb-8b59c6ff4540-1566236765"}

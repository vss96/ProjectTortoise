And according to the same Christian doctrine, God is the greatest and there is nobody above Him.  Which means everything He does He has only Himself to please.\r\n\r\nSo, the Father inflicked pain on the Son to please, okay, maybe the Holy Spirit.  But since they're all the same being, you could also say that God inflicked pain on Himself to please Himself.\r\n\r\nMan I'm in the wrong religion.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uwtg","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808642,"author":"xenu","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cuxrx","edited":false,"id":"cuy1o","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31127-60ae6bdf-ee16-43d2-889d-5ee4d6c9731f-1566236769"}

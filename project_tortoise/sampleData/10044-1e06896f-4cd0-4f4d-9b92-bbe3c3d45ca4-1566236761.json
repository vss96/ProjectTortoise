A burn over 20% of an adult body is considered to be serious; this will get 50% of the body. But it's even worse, burns to the face/hands/feet/genitals are considered far more serious and this is guaranteed to get part of them all.\r\n\r\nThese weapons are known to cause burns if someone has anything metallic on because it reflects it onto part of the body already getting dosed, AKA doubles the dosage. This means that someone in the beam that doesn't get out in the necessary time *will* get burnt and then you likely have a very gruesome and horrific death to look forward to.","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10044-1e06896f-4cd0-4f4d-9b92-bbe3c3d45ca4-1566236761"}

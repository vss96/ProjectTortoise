According to Wilipedia, \"Brakhage is revered as one of the most important experimental filmmakers of the 20th century, and his work has had some small impact on mainstream cinema. The credits of the film Seven, with their scratched emulsion, rapid cutaways and bursts of light are very much in Brakhage's style. Among Brakhage's students were the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and he is featured in their student film Cannibal! The Musical. The character Stan in South Park is apparently an homage to Brakhage, in name if nothing else. The opening track of Stereolab's album Dots and Loops, \"Brakhage\", is also named after him\".","link_id":"t3_u321","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165561781,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15534-c82d397a-db33-484e-b2b5-62e74532019e-1566236762"}

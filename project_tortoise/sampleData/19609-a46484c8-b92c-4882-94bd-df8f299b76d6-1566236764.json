Flinch. Protestant child? Squirm. Muslim child? Shudder. Everybody's consciousness should be raised to this level. Occasionally a euphemism is needed, and I suggest \"Child of Jewish (etc) parents\". When you come down to it, that's all we are really talking about anyway. Just as the upside-down (northern hemisphere chauvinism again: flinch!) map from New Zealand raises consciousness about a geographical truth, children should hear themselves described not as \"Christian children\" but as \"children of Christian parents\". This in itself would raise their consciousness, empower them to make up their own minds and choose which religion, if any, they favour, rather than just assume that religion means \"same beliefs as parents\". I could well imagine that this linguistically coded freedom to choose might lead children to choose no religion at all.\"\r\n\r\n-Richard Dawkins","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19609-a46484c8-b92c-4882-94bd-df8f299b76d6-1566236764"}

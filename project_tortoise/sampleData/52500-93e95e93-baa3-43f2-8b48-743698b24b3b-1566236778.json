Ford. President Ford was a great American who gave many years of dedicated service to our country. On August 9, 1974, after a long career in the House of Representatives and service as Vice President, he assumed the Presidency in an hour of national turmoil and division. With his quiet integrity, common sense, and kind instincts, President Ford helped heal our land and restore public confidence in the Presidency. The American people will always admire Gerald Ford's devotion to duty, his personal character, and the honorable conduct of his administration. We mourn the loss of such a leader, and our 38th President will always have a special place in our Nation's memory. On behalf of all Americans, Laura and I offer our deepest sympathies to Betty Ford and all of President Ford's family. Our thoughts and prayers will be with them in the hours and days ahead.\"[61]\r\nfrom\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford#Death\r\nbush hasn't given that speech yet but I have even money he will use it verbatim....","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52500-93e95e93-baa3-43f2-8b48-743698b24b3b-1566236778"}

I don't consider it opulence in the first place. Opulence is Hearst Castle: hoarding all the junk you can find just so you can impress people. The art and architecture we see in those photographs -- St. Peter's Square, the Sistine Chapel, and yes, even that modern sculpture in the first picture -- is not meant to win friends at a cocktail party. It's meant to simultaneously exalt God and translate just a kernel of the beauty people see in him into something concrete that may be shared with all humanity. Pretty Christ-like, that.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166122710,"score":10,"ups":10,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28536-2c8e0183-54d0-4cc5-991b-08d0988fed4f-1566236768"}

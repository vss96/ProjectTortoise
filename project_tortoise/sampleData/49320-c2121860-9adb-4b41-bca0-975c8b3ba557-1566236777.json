Didn't mean to strike a nerve -- there's so much real estate in your post that I hardly know where to start -- lessee, I don't think it would be an exaggeration to suggest that people resent being \"talked to\" in a condescending way. Yes. When you presume to \"help\" me because you \"are sure\" I'm unhappy with my computing experience, it wears thin in a hurry -- and believe me, there's lots of it.\r\n\r\nMac users are very often \"evangelical\". Just do whatever you do and preach to someone else. I was in Books-a-million a while back, and saw a magazine on how-to-fix-your-Mac or something to that effect, plus I've been using a 'puter for a long time, so I know Macs aren't trouble-free, either.\r\n\r\nyou said:\r\n&gt;Why do Pro-Mac posts incite you to make Anti-Mac posts?\r\n\r\nI normally do not. Reddit is not the only place I frequent, and every time I run across someone who has to tell the world what a wonderful OS he has, I die a little bit. Sometimes I respond.\r\n\r\nI can't stand MS or Bill Gates, but I can't remember the last time I had a problem with my PC. Mac users seem to think \"Windows\" is still like Windows '95. I'll make a deal -- if you **ever** catch me singing the praises of Windows, I'll send $50 to the charity of your choice and post the receipt. Please have the same consideration.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809340,"gilded":0,"id":"cvyj6","parent_id":"t1_cvydr","edited":false,"author":"DA5lD","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49320-c2121860-9adb-4b41-bca0-975c8b3ba557-1566236777"}

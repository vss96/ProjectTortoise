Preventing your kids from having contact with these people in school isn't going to solve anything; it will just leave them unable to deal with them later in life.\r\n\r\nIf you had a horrible school experience, then maybe you should become *involved* in the school you send your child to, so that your child and the other children who go there have a better experience -- instead of writing *yet another* rant about how the school system is fundamentally broken, beyond repair, and must be replaced with something completely different.\r\n\r\nThere's a reason we developed schools.  Schools are a pretty good idea.  Not everybody can afford to homeschool their children, and not everyone who can afford it is qualified.  It is more efficient to relegate this task to specialists in various fields.  It is the parents' responsibility to keep an eye on the running of the school and *try to fix it if it's broken*.\r\n\r\nSchools have to be supported by communities.  Schools break down when parents start seeing them as somebody else's problem, and something they don't have to put any care or effort into.\r\n\r\nRants like this remind me of software developers who let their projects become bogged down by bugs and kludgy hacks... but it's OK, because the next version will be a complete rewrite, which will fix all the problems!  And when that version goes to crap, they'll just totally rewrite it again!  And again!  Because actually fixing problems, instead of scrapping what you have and starting from scratch, is *hard*.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30170-a352ab0c-d61b-4af3-b11f-ac0c933eb698-1566236769"}

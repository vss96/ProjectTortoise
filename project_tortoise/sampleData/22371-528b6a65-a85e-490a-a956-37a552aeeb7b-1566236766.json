Just because we might be on the verge of recession, this isn't all bad news.  Without market volatility and decline, we'd be in even bigger trouble.\r\n\r\nFor the people talking about investing in gold versus the dollar:  This is not some crazy phenomenom.  Gold has long operated on a trend inverse of that of the dollar.  The dollar market raises, gold prices decrease and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nHousing prices are a poor indicator of an \"economic storm.\"  It is another bubble, much like those of the past.  Dot com, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, etc.\r\n\r\nFor fairykarma who asked how the public could be aware of such crisis when they don't read telegraph and reddit, etc:  If you're basing your financial decisions on the articles that regularly hit these sites, woe unto you.\r\n\r\nAgain people, get a grip and know that you're probably just fine.  Save and invest wisely.","link_id":"t3_ucp9","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808302,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"shawnlhood","edited":false,"id":"cufvb","parent_id":"t3_ucp9","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22371-528b6a65-a85e-490a-a956-37a552aeeb7b-1566236766"}

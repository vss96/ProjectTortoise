We know that pouring money in just fattens the coffers of the thugs in charge. Sending in troops to \"control things\" ultimately doesn't work.\r\n\r\nIf the US is going to interfere in another country's business, I think a subversive economic approach would probably give us the best return on our investment: send in aid workers who will help dig wells, build and staff schools, educate farmers into latest techniques, create entrepreneurial foundries coupled with micro-loans. \r\n\r\nStaff it all with youngish people in return for paying for their college. Back it up with a military hovering nearby ready to kick anybodies ass who tries to cause trouble.\r\n\r\nExpensive? Yes. But probably cheaper than what we've spent on the war. I'm guessing the world might not mind that kind of \"foreign intervention\".","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vurq","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1166905863,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47698-da331665-be2e-4c79-8cf3-6cff37dd92c7-1566236775"}

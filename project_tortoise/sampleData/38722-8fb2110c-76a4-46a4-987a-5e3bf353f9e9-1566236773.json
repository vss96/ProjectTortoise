China artificially makes your money worth more by making the savings of the Chinese people worth less.  It is a transfer of wealth from China to the US.  It's somewhat puzzling why US politicians get so worked up about this.  The dumping argument doesn't quite hold because these really aren't industries the US is competitive in anyway.\r\n\r\nThere are two other related points about China that are consistently overlooked:\r\n\r\n1) Their growth is totally dependent on burning ever more massive amounts of domestically produced coal.  The China manufacturing boom runs on coal.  When they can't produce more coal, for either supply or ecological reasons, the boom will stop.\r\n\r\n2) China is ecologically near collapse.  The current boom is dependent on the continued destruction of their environment.    China will have large scale human health and food supply catastrophes in the foreseeable future.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vct7","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":3,"score":3,"created_utc":1166549557,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38722-8fb2110c-76a4-46a4-987a-5e3bf353f9e9-1566236773"}

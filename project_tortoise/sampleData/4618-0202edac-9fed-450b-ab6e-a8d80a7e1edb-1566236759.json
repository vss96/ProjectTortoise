He should have realized that a police officer would never instruct him to *force someone to perform a sexual act over the phone*, let alone the other despicable things he did.\r\n\r\nI also place a big heap of blame on the assistant manager, Summers.  She should have had alarm bells going off in her head when the \"police officer\" told her to get her fiance to watch the victim.  Also, if her manager was supposedly on the line, why didn't Summers, at some point in the two hour call, ever try to ask her anything like, \"Are you ok with this?\", especially since the instructions she was receiving were against stated company policy.  Yes, I realize if she'd tried to ask her manager something the caller would probably have come up with some excuse, but this should have been a clear indicator the caller was bogus.\r\n\r\nI think they deserve what they got, and probably should have recevied harsher sentences.  I think it's a shame the caller got off scott free.\r\n\r\nI hope Ogborn wins her lawsuit against McDonald's.  They share the blame, too, for allowing this to happen.\r\n\r\nEdit: Corrected typos.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807618,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cteaw","id":"ctfc9","author":"emiller40","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4618-0202edac-9fed-450b-ab6e-a8d80a7e1edb-1566236759"}

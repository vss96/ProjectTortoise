From my experience I'd say that to even get close to nailing a piece really requires practice.  Sometimes when I play I sound perfect as far as I or others listening are concerned, though almost only when I have been practicing a lot. But in music, the key to expressive playing is often small variations in timing that the study would call imperfections.  I really would not want to play mathematically perfectly, even in the more rigorous Bach keyboard pieces some variations in timing and volume are needed to get the piece to sound \"right.\"  You can hear midi files of pieces that are played with no variation in timing or dynamics and they sound like crap.  But against the study, those variations themselves are a result of control, not the inability to control minor variations.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vmcm","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46060-d450972a-627b-48d0-a13d-bc8419fc9b82-1566236775"}

{"body":"Oh please, you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. \r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the future budgets is Medicare and Social Security, BOTH of which Bush tried to present solutions to keep them viable and affordable, but the media, AARP, and the Dems went fucking apeshit for purely political reasons.\r\n\r\nMost politicians are not concerned about fixing problems that are 50 years away, they are concerned about getting re-elected. Bush tried to take on the reward-less and political suicidal problem of Social Security and was mercilessly ripped for it. Privatization of Social Security was the #1 reason I voted for Bush in 2000, and it's been a huge disappointment for me that he's been unable to make it happen, but I ultimately blame the Reps and Dems in Congress for killing it.\r\n\r\nThe best we &lt;30yr olds can do now is max out our Roth IRA and 401k and shelter as much income from taxes as possible because we ain't getting shit in 40years.","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_vc4j","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166543296,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cvd6n","parent_id":"t1_cvd0r","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808928,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38436-bf495ed9-6a74-4bb8-a135-b2f4623e7ef2-1566236773"}

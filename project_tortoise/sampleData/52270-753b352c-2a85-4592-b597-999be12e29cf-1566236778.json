Bush and the Republicans obviously have no empathy for the troops. They sent them into an unnecessary war and covered each other's asses by saying it was just a mishap and stupidity instead of full intention and lies.\r\n\r\nThese men and women, many of whom were driven into the army by economic needs and lies (\"Trust me, you won't be sent into Iraq if you don't want to. Plus, the war is actually over.. Just sign here.\"), or out of genuine but obviously betrayed love for their country and a good cause, are being formed into an anonymous body of a powerful tool.\r\n\r\nSo of course people may ask why the Bush twins or anyone close to any Republican aren't over there right now. Obviously a draft wouldn't solve the problem because these chicken hawks know how to dive under it, citing \"other priorities\" like Cheney during Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that is left is to cast a public spotlight on them and make them a bit uneasy. If the Bush twins actually went to Iraq it wouldn't be possible to deploy them as normal troops anyway, given their VIP status. That remains up to mortals like Jim Webb's boy.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167192203,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52270-753b352c-2a85-4592-b597-999be12e29cf-1566236778"}

Learn self-defense because it'll help you with #1 and when situation != #1. \r\n\r\n3. Don't think because you got your &lt;color&gt; belt in &lt;martial_art&gt; you're invincible. \r\n\r\n3.5 If your working against a bigger opponent, remember that it doesn't take too much strength to break a finger. \r\n\r\n4. Sometimes a rapid escalation in violence can nip it in the bud. If you know it's coming, get the first shot in and make it a doozy. To paraphrase Jim Harrison, nobody knows karate if you get in a really good sucker punch.\r\n\r\n5. If you're in a fight for your life, fight dirty, definitely. Lots of bad things can happen, but all of them are better than being dead. Aim for the groin, the throat, etc. Seek to maximize pain and damage. Use anything you can as a weapon. Stop when you're safe, and get away when you can.\r\n\r\n6. Violence begets violence, and sometimes pacifism begets violence. Walk away when you can. Show mercy when you have won. \r\n\r\n7. If there's a knife involved, you're probably going to get cut. Just try to make sure it's only the one time and not on any part that's hard to repair.\r\n\r\n8. Guns? Aim center-mass. Never aim at an extremity. It's too easy to miss--esp. with a handgun. And don't underestimate your target's ability to reach you before you draw/aim/shoot. \r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vjjh","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809094,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ewokjedi","id":"cvlm6","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vjjh","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42821-3a9e2caa-2697-428c-a487-29818a8c4352-1566236774"}

Most of the clothes they sell are really good and really cheap.  They can't screen out middle class people from shopping there.\r\n\r\nHell I even shop there occasionally.\r\n\r\nAs for the clothes that go to the recyclers, I can attest that they are clothes that have tears, stains, missing buttons, etc., or have sat on the rack for at least a month without selling.  They should pay to shuttle crates of this stuff overseas?  It would probably end up recycled there too.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809156,"gilded":0,"id":"cvowq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvoud","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44463-3e1de25d-42a0-48f7-872e-fee39c9cd47a-1566236774"}

I don't even think it was necessarily a bad decision.  There was already a rumor going around that there was a firearm stashed in the trash can.  Running that type of thing up the beaurocracy is probably much slower than just grabbing the thing and handing it over.\r\n\r\nIf someone is caught with the firearm then you treat them as if they were caught with a firearm.  If someone brings one to you and says, \"I found this.\" then you treat them as if they found it and are turning it in.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_uvo6","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808636,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dwils27","edited":false,"id":"cuxov","parent_id":"t1_cuwe7","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30931-6826d935-6479-46c3-8b78-9fdeff46abe3-1566236769"}

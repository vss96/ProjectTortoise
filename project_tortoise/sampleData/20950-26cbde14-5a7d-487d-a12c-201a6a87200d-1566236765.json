Further, I did not say \"EVERY US President\" I said \"Just about every\" there is a difference.\r\n\r\n\"How can you possibly know that?\"\r\nHer own words! If you are trying to tell me she is NOT being used to advance an agenda.... then I am all ears to hear why you think this is not so.\r\n\r\nIf you are not outraged at this, then I ask you simply this -- if the tables were turned, and the eight year old girl were advancing a *Christian* agenda, would you be? If so -- then you are a hypocrite. If not, then I dont have a leg to stand on -- but this would mean you would not be able to post things like Christian parents have no right teaching Christianity to their kids.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u9s2","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-1,"ups":-1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165790768,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20950-26cbde14-5a7d-487d-a12c-201a6a87200d-1566236765"}

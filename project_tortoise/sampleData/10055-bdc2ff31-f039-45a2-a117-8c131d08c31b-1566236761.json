Go to church every week, and I'll agree with you Rise, there is a significant percentage of the  members of the Mormon church that have very intolerant attitudes towards gay people.  I hammer the tolerance and christlike love issue every chance I get.  Intolerance is one of the worst traits of any group, whether it's a religious or political group.  The intolerance in the Mormon church, however, seems to me to be rooted mostly in social tradition.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think there is a trend in the Mormon church to be more accepting and tolerant, as my generation is much more receptive and tolerant to other lifestyles.  Not that we don't disagree with them on a doctrinal viewpoint, but when it comes to day-to-day interaction, we simply don't have any problem being around or being friends with gay people. I have gay friends, and like them just fine.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_tpok","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165357708,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10055-bdc2ff31-f039-45a2-a117-8c131d08c31b-1566236761"}

{"body":"I think you are misunderstanding the purpose of a guideline. Breaking the 7-10 line rule doesn't mean your code is going to blow up, but it serves as a warning for a programmer who doesn't have a good sense of when code is getting unmanageable. Thinking twice about whether this is really the best way to write the code every time your method goes over 10 lines is really not a bad thing in Smalltalk (in Java you unfortunately have encapsulation problems that force you to change the rule such that it ignores finally blocks and other ugliness).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u0r5","subreddit":"programming","ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1165566670,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"xcbsmith","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu393","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu2xm","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808065,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15607-cda463df-13d7-4050-9e81-bc5048dafe31-1566236763"}

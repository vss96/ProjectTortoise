If an asset is easily tradeable, then it's price will move to the point where, roughly speaking, there are as many people thinking it will go up as there are people thinking it will go down.\r\n\r\nAlways bear this in mind when a newspaper columnist starts talking about how the price such-and-such will likely go up (or down) in the future - what makes him more clairvoyant than the people who actually trade for a living?  If everyone thought the price was going to go up, then they would make damn sure they profit from the change by buying more of it *now*, which drives the price up to its future value *now*, leaving it in a state of \"could go either way\".\r\n\r\nThere are of course exceptions - what if the market isn't liquid (housing would be a good example), what if there are insiders who know more than they should (the article does fleetingly touch on this point), what if there are outsiders who know far less than they should (.com/housing/etc)?\r\n\r\nIf an article doesn't focus on these kinds of points, ignores the \"no free lunch\" principle, and instead talks about how well known facts (like the rise of china, middle east instability) or well known opinions (like peak oil etc), are going to move the market in a certain direction, then it is junk.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165850456,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cufvn","parent_id":"t1_cudpn","author_flair_text":null,"author":"acrophobia","retrieved_on":1473808302,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22375-678663fe-88bc-4473-854f-00eff62954fd-1566236766"}

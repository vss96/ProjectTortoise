The government controls the very basis of the free market: the money and the markets themselves. Its manipulation of these are far more powerful and more difficult to understand and detect than such obvious stuff as destroying a dairy company.\r\n\r\nIn a totally free market, money systems would compete, legal  and law-enforcement systems would compete, making power centers unlikely in these most powerful of modern-day power centers. In fact, if the monetary and legal systems were privatized it would probably take most of the power of modern nation states - at least the power they wield over their own citizens.\r\n\r\nEdit: sorry for not addressing your specific issues re: negative externalities. I agree that these are problems. The the free market solutions are somewhat convoluted (although not as convoluted as what we have now), but they have the advantage of discouraging yet another power center in the form of a huge, costly, corrupt and ultimately ineffective government bureaucracy.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ubuw","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808245,"author":"NoFixedAbode","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuctm","id":"cucv6","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20750-ff0e137d-ccef-4a68-9d1c-26dfc2366615-1566236765"}

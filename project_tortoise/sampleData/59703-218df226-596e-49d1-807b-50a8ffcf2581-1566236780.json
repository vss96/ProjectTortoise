I'm assuming that when the phone is powered down it is not receiving or transmitting, therefore can't be notified to go into snoop mode. Even if it's already on snoop mode, I think the power button would still kill it - cell phones typically have pretty horrible usability standards and I can't see them suddenly wising up for the FBI. Therefore the power button seems a safe solution to this problem at least until battery life significantly improves and we have true \"standby\" devices.\r\n\r\nThis can all be verified by walking by a small radio or other cheap electronic device with a speaker, although not completely verified unless the FBI is curious about you.","retrieved_on":1473809720,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwi8j","id":"cwips","author_flair_text":null,"author":"stevarino","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59703-218df226-596e-49d1-807b-50a8ffcf2581-1566236780"}

The particular things that the state does are justified by how it works.\r\n\r\n&gt; How about the drug war? Is that an implicit agreement? Spending half of the money they take on crazy foreign wars? How about that?\r\n\r\nYou are confusing the justification for the state's existence with the justification for its actions.  In the case of the USA government, it is a democratic republic.  Its existence is justified by the social contract, but it's *actions* are justified by the fact that elected representatives of the people created laws enabling the government to do such things.\r\n\r\nIf you have a problem with wars, if you have a problem with taxes, if you have a problem with prohibition, then don't blame the social contract permitting the existence of the state, blame your representatives and your fellow citizens for making the state act the way that it does.\r\n\r\nIt is only if you deny that people should fall under the jurisdiction of the state *at all* that you should have a problem with the social contract.  In this case, whether the government takes money from you for feeding the poor or whether it is taken from you to further wars and prohibition, it makes no difference.","controversiality":1,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808521,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_curdv","id":"curlk","edited":false,"author":"Bogtha","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27972-231efcca-0973-48de-8053-08c7122131da-1566236768"}

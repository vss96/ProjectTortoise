That's so *special*).\r\n\r\nIf you really want to spend lots of money to celebrate your engagement, there are hundreds of better things to spend it on -- an overseas holiday, part of the cost of a house, a car, a trust fund for your hypothetical children's education, nice furniture... just about anything I can think of is better than a diamond ring.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u6tj","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165709989,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19288-eaaf8c0a-9abc-4ee8-ae26-2afd8af6c907-1566236764"}

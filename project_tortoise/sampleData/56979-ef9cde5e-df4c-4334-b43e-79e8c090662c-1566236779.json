They were building magnificent homes and markets with sophisticated cooling techniques when most Europeans still lived in mud huts.\r\n\r\nCorrect, but sandstone isn't an adequate building material for a metropolis. Not only would the harvesting of it be extremely inefficient and cumbersome, just for the building surfaces let alone to actually try and build anything with it. But I agree, they could do a lot more to actually keep the feel of it being of Persian architecture and not make it look like Vegas.\r\n\r\nBut then again London has plenty of tach in it, someone actually thought it was a good idea to construct a giant crystal phallus in the middle of the city that won awards... although I suppose it keeps well with traditionally European culture of putting giant phallus everywhere, it was only a matter of time till they made a building into one.\r\n\r\nI wish they could just build a building that actually looked like a building and not a mutant penis or an alien that's been wacked with a pry bar. I mean there's like the Empire State building that still looks like a normal building, but not much else thanks to the post-modernists.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wcfe","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809619,"author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cwdcc","parent_id":"t1_cwd27","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56979-ef9cde5e-df4c-4334-b43e-79e8c090662c-1566236779"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"In Algol (oooh - was it 60 or 68?) you had first class labels.\r\n\r\nYou could call a function with a label as argument. Then later, you could jump to the label in question.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n  Function A have a label labelA in its body.\r\n  Function A now calls B with labelA as argument,\r\n  and stores it in, say, a global variable.\r\n  Function B calls C.\r\n  Now C gotos to the label stored by B.\r\n  The effect is to remove the stack frames on the stack representing the calls to B and C, and continue with the statement labeled by labelA.\r\n\r\nThese labels are effectively \"continuations\". \r\nHowever opposed to call/cc continuations, only \"upwards continuations\" are supported.\r\n\r\n","link_id":"t3_ujj3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166277372,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"soegaard","edited":false,"id":"cv0s1","parent_id":"t1_cuzl7","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808694,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32364-4641dbe2-26af-476e-a86e-7158f5139fd2-1566236770"}

If he (or someone just like him) was teaching your science class and was saying “evolution and the Big Bang were not scientific” or “that dinosaurs were aboard Noah’s ark” would you care? How about if they were teaching this to your son or daughter? \r\n\r\n&gt; If their beliefs offend you, then you can speak up. But I'm not going to do it for you.\r\n\r\nI agree, people need to speak for themselves. \r\n\r\nI've been reading [this](http://forums.kearnyontheweb.com/index.php?showtopic=2955) discussion started by Matthew LaClair’s father Paul. I have to commend Matthew for speaking up initially and Paul for the time and effort he has put into the subsequent discussion. Sometimes speaking up requires a lot of courage and I think this is a good example.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v6h2","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166482532,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37016-6413434d-1ee5-4988-92d6-6944c59f15ac-1566236772"}

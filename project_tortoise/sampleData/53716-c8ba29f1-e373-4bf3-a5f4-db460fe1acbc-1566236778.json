Read the above quotes. They claim that Leverett is lying in his Op-Ed positions and his analysis. Their accusations of lying are actually lies. It is the diarist who misrepresent the situation with Iran and Syria. You admit yourself that the things the diarists claim did not happen, actually happened. So how can you possibly claim their conclusions based on these lies remain valid? You can not if you are self-consistent or honest. Which appears to be more and more the situation.\r\n\r\n2.You project I have some \r\n&gt;\"deep trust for some set of Western Elites\". \r\n\r\nThis is indeed projection, because it is what you yourself are actually doing. You have essentially backed the neo-con, naked empire position, which if anything has proven to be an abject failure over the last 6 years, and has demonstrated convincingly to the world the clear limits of what US military power can achieve.\r\n\r\nI trust anyone only as far as I can verify. Leverett's Op-Ed is verifiable true in all its positions. You have admitted as much. Accepting Leverett's position's and thesis is not a factional endorsement, but rather a factual one. You on the other hand do not seem to need facts from which to draw conclusions, as your continued endorsement of the positions of your dishonest and absolutely inaccurate diarist continues to indicate.\r\n\r\n3.You do not believe in diplomacy. \r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the \"son of a diplomat\", this is an unbelievable statement. Diplomacy works, has worked, will continue to work, because even at this late date, everyone in the world receives more advantage from working with the USA than against USA, even without military concerns factored in. Though China is scooping up more and more of the nations of the world into its growing sphere of influence as we ineffectually rattle our sabers.\r\n\r\n4.You somehow believe Iran is an actor that can not be negotiated with. \r\n\r\nYou, as the diarists you have cited, have no evidence of this. You yourself conclude Iran must be rational because as you acknowledge after 9-11 they worked with us on Afghanistan. Yet several paragraphs later you claim it is impossible to negotiate with them because they have no reason to cooperate. And yet they did have reason to cooperate after 9-11, and they did cooperate. Further they have offered us a comprehensive treaty which we did not even attempt to address, which officially we do not acknowledge. If there is any irrational party in the current situation it is the US administration and their backers, who want war with Iran, which seems to be your unstated position here. This coincidently remains the neo-con position.\r\n\r\n5.You believe that they have attacked \"us\". \r\n\r\nYou cited Khobar Towers and some organization in Argentina. Those are not attacks on the USA. Who you are identifying as \"us\", I don't know, but it's clearly not the USA. Ask most US citizens about the Kobar Towers they won't know what you are talking about. Yes some US Soldiers died in the Towers, but more people have died in the WTC, which was on American soil and was not attacked by Iran or Iraq or Afghanistan for that matter.\r\n\r\n6.You cite some obscure example from the 19th century to indicate the US is not always the dominant player in a negotiation. \r\n\r\nObviously China with 1.2+ billion people, about 300 million of whom live in first world conditions, is a country that is on the rise, that has the potential to seriously challenge US power world wide, and therefore would be unlikely to be a supplicant in any deal with any nation ever. Iran is no China.\r\n\r\n7.You claim the US has no \"soft power\". \r\n\r\nThis is a ridiculously wrong statement. The US under Bush/Cheney has chosen to abandon non-military avenues of dealing with the world. The US hasn't lost any non-military power. The current administration refuses to use any.\r\n\r\n8.You are against international Justice.\r\n\r\nI think that law and justice are the basis for civilization. I think the Nuremberg trials were the first attempt to address the atrocities of Germany and were well worth it. I think the pursuit of Pinochet was worth it, had it been possible to get him into court and try him. I think that a trial of Saddam internationally would have been a good idea. The Kangaroo court in Iraq however is just a mockery of justice. The attempts at military tribunals in Gitmo are also a mockery of justice. I don't claim that Saddam or the many unnamed people in Gitmo have not committed crimes, I claim the \"courts\" that attempt to \"try\" them are a mockery of real courts and real trials. At this point we have really strayed from the Op-Ed which is the topic of the thread.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nMy position is that the Leverett Op-Ed is correct, that the current administration has refused all diplomatic attempts to handle the Iranian situation, and that the diplomatic solutions remain available and viable. Further it is not really possible to refute this position which is exactly why the Op-Ed was ham handedly censored.\r\n\r\nI don't know that there is any value in continuing this discussion, since your view apparently is unchangeable. I am open for discussion with anyone who wants to discuss facts. I have cited many many in the last 5000+ words. You have refused to address any, and have continued to expand you specious position with irrelevant references, the 19th century Chinese emperor and Ottman Empire examples and their flawed conclusion being the latest example. I have confined my discussion to completely refuting the examples you have cited as you strayed farther and farther from the Op-Ed headlining this thread. Until you attempt to address the reality of the Op-Ed's contents and my complete refutation of your \"evidence\" you are just wasting my time. Worse you are advocating a position that you can not support because you do not grasp even the most basic truths that underlie the situation which your \"position\" attempts to address.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vq1i","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167253569,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53716-c8ba29f1-e373-4bf3-a5f4-db460fe1acbc-1566236778"}

Think about the ICU stays, etc ($10k a day minimum) that will arise during that year. Costs for the procedure are low, but maintenance is what gets you. The tab for this case was picked up by \"the foundation\" (a small investment considering the publicity). They aren't paying full price, but I can assure you when it's not an advertised case this company will bill a lot more for their device. \r\n\r\nPeople die of heart failure by the hundreds each day. This company just wants to increase their bottom line by delaying the inevitable.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808649,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cuxvw","edited":false,"id":"cuyev","author_flair_text":null,"author":"ruschr","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"31294-af383123-b975-4c1c-8c50-952100c5af23-1566236769"}

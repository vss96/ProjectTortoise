{"body":"In Reddit's defense your thread was also upmodded. \r\n\r\nAlso I believe rocky_m's post was upmodded in spite of his discrimitory remarks rather than because of them (at least for most of the voters). It provided information pertinent to the discussion.  For example I didn't know a Clitoridotomy was an actual surgical procedure before reading that, or that it was practiced in the West until relatively recently.   \r\n\r\nI agree with you that there are some common biases amidst your average Reddit commenter.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tk48","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165280847,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"thevalarauk","parent_id":"t1_ctma4","id":"ctmur","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807759,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"7977-6dcc942c-b342-49fd-9404-a430918ef0ac-1566236760"}

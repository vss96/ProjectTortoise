Rails is so popular it boosted Ruby adoption quite a bit.\r\n\r\nWell to me the most useful definition of popular for a web framework is how many developers actually use it, and you have already conceded that the population of ruby developers is fairly small. I would never deny that it has been fairly influential.\r\n\r\n&gt;So does Rails\r\n\r\nbut not as many, but to be fair it has not been in use as long, so time will tell on this one.\r\n\r\n&gt;Complete rubbish. You act as if there's some dark cabal of Rubyists issuing edicts to the effect of \"THERE SHALL BE ONE FRAMEWORK AND NO OTHERS BEFORE IT\".\r\n\r\nnow that is complete rubbish, and an obvious attempt to set up a straw man to be attacked. I called it a view, not a tyrany enforced by a dark cabal. There is not shortage of ruby users stating that python should just \"get one good framework\". The attitude seems prevalent and as a result I stand by my statement.\r\n\r\n&gt;I cannot conceive of how you arrived at such a position &gt;when both Ruby and Rails are fucking open source apps. &gt;Nobody is forcing people to work on or with Rails.\r\n\r\nI have never suggested that DDH looms large over ruby developers wielding a whip and forcing him to do his bidding. I am simply saying that ruby developers view only having one decent web framework as being a good thing, and I do not.\r\n\r\n&gt;The competition already happened. You blinked. You missed it.\r\n\r\ndoesnt sound like much of a competition...\r\n\r\n&gt;I don't know, maybe because it's a good framework?\r\n\r\nwouldnt 2 , 3 , 4 or more good frameworks be even better?\r\nI find it hard to believe that anyone would take the position that ruby is the ultimate framework for every concievable application.\r\n\r\n&gt;Ruby doesn't have a huge number of developers.\r\n\r\nThats actually another pretty good theory. I suppose if manpower is lacking, concentrating effort is a fairly reasonable thing to do. That said, several interesting and still popular frameworks in the python world are 1 man efforts, so I find it unlikely.\r\n\r\n&gt;Camping, and Nitro. Borges \r\n\r\nI will confess I have never heard of these before, I shall have to set aside some time to check them out.\r\n\r\n&gt;Rails is to metaprogramming what Seaside is to continuations.\r\n\r\nHardly, metaprogramming was a well known and popular technique long before rails came along. Possibly it did it for rails developers, but certainly it did not spur the widespread interest in the topic for the first time as Seaside did for continutations. If you want to make a popularizing claim, then go with the full stack approach, there it is deserved.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808202,"gilded":0,"id":"cuajd","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu85q","author":"seanodonnell","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19552-cba8ffec-22b5-4085-91da-94078730d02c-1566236764"}

Hashing is still safer and has much less liability (because there's no reasonable way for the site operator to back out the passwords, and even less, with a key, for hackers to do so without the code).  Encryption, though it does have all sorts of obvious benefits over cleartext, allows for a constant-time means to back out the cleartext, which is automatically (to me) makes hashing worth the (infrequent) hassle of forgotten password shenanigans.\r\n\r\nI thought hashing passwords was SoP these days.","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1166125612,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cusxq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuswp","author_flair_text":null,"author":"duketime","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808547,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28651-f0564484-d059-478f-8c88-be1f41500fa0-1566236768"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"While I agree with the first part, I disagree completely with the second because she doesn't have a clue to the meaning of the phrase.\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend works part time in a coffee shop, and some of the people that go in there are complete ass holes. One had a go at her because she was taking too long making eigh*teen* coffees despite her getting every one of them correct.\r\n\r\nNow the second phrase, it's not aimed at everyone it's aimed at ass holes that she's complaining at in the first place. Every normal person treats you with respect so thus they get your respect, and similarly everyone you meet gets your respect so long as they're not acting pompus or something.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of the 'earn respect' idiology is that if you treat someone as a human being you'll be treated like one yourself. If you treat someone like they're shit, you'll be treated like shit and it could equally be called karmic respect.\r\n\r\nShe doesn't seem to get the point that if you *combined* the two of working in food/retail service and that you have to earn respect it would quickly sort itself out when all the ass holes no longer get served because they didn't deserve respect.\r\n\r\nFinally, the customer is usually wrong as the customer usually doesn't know what they want. I've heard people complaining about how their website was designed, even though they *asked* for it. I wouldn't go into a restaurant and tell them how to make my food, because the whole point is I want *them* to do it and I pick them because I like how *they* do it.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_upgw","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166118846,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuseb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_upgw","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808537,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28363-f816b271-8492-4cc4-bebd-d1ffdac99c7f-1566236768"}

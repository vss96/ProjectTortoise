In a lawsuit, money can be demanded from the defendant in three ways: a) a fine; b) legal fees of the prosecutor and c) compensation for damages, economic or otherwise. \r\n\r\nOnly government actors can demand (a), whilst legal fees can only be demanded in criminal cases (although they are often offered in settlements or bargains). Hence, in this case, we are left with (c).\r\n\r\nYet how could the RIAA *possibly* justify damages of 1.6 trillion? As pointed out elsewhere, this has an equivalence of some 82 billion records, which is more than the total number of records sold in the last century. This will not ever hold up in a courtroom. \r\n\r\nThe RIAA mad? Perhaps, but probably not. They will not get their money (I doubt they ever intended to) but they will succeed in shutting down another easy method to download music illegally.","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47141-8529d403-9188-4797-84fe-3892e12176a0-1566236775"}

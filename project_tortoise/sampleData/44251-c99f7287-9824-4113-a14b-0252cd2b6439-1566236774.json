{"body":"If we could prove that whatever caused the previous ones was also causing this one, then we would have all this leftover cause, so to speak: the human contribution to the environment, which you would expect to have the effect we’re seeing. It would be *bizarre* if all human activity was having no particular effect.\r\n\r\nThis is what I was trying to get at with the tree metaphor. If you know something occasionally happens for random reasons, it only slightly discounts the obvious conclusion when it happens at the same time as a cause which fits the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nTo put it yet another way: We’ve indirectly observed many warmings that we know didn’t have a human cause. But since humans have been doing enough to be a plausible cause, we’ve had a sharp warming trend. So we only have one data point on human influence, but so far its correlation with warming is very strong.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vm6j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166735472,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"celoyd","id":"cvoiz","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvof6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809151,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44251-c99f7287-9824-4113-a14b-0252cd2b6439-1566236774"}

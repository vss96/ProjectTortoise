My friend had never had truffles before but he had a suspicion that's what was grated on top. He can afford it so he didn't complain, but still never expected it to be $55. In the end he said he was no so upset but just boggled as to how macaroni could have come out to $55 given the other prices on the menu. He's also a very cool, very nice guy, so give him some slack eh?\r\nOh and BTW he didn't even eat any of the dish, he let his friend have the whole thing because the portion was so small. After all, he had his $18.00 pot pie coming soon!","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17402-1ea7e648-1fcd-4680-bf30-f7c0491e67c7-1566236763"}

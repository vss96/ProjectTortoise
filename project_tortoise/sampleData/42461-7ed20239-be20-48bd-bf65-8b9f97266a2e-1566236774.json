The canard that driving under the traffic flow speed is as dangerous as driving over has been [debunked in traffic engineering literature](http://www.tfhrc.gov/safety/speed/speed.htm).  The original study counted accidents where drivers had suddenly pulled out onto the roadway and got smashed from behind as \"driving less than traffic flow\" accidents.  Removing those showed that driving under the traffic flow is far less dangerous than driving over, and not much more dangerous (from a being rear ended perspective) than driving at the flow.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, there is the undeniable fact that the only thing that makes driving at the speed limit dangerous (from a being rear ended perspective) is other drivers *breaking the law and driving faster.*\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vjh2","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809080,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jvance","id":"cvkxi","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvkh4","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42461-7ed20239-be20-48bd-bf65-8b9f97266a2e-1566236774"}

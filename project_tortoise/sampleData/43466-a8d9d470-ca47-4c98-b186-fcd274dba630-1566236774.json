In Europe, Asians prefer the term Oriental, which literally means ‘those from the East’.\r\n\r\nI've never quite understood this one.  I see Oriental Markets, and Oriental Food all over the place.  Is it one of those, \"It's ok for us to use it, but not you\" or is it one of those things where Asians don't really care but bleeding-hearts cry about it for them.  You'll definitely get chastised less for using Oriental than saying Chinese/Japanese/Korean/etc and getting it wrong.","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1166719363,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vmh8","edited":false,"id":"cvn5i","author":"PhilK","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809122,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43466-a8d9d470-ca47-4c98-b186-fcd274dba630-1566236774"}

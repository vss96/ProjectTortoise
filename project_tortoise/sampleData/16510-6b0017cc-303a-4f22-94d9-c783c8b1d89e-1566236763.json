{"body":"I'm an American studying abroad (with a bunch of other nationalities), I got real tired (real quick) of people making \"Lazy American\" jokes.  Especially from the French kids.  Some of us have observed the following:\r\n\r\n* The Dutch are lazy: when the sun's out.\r\n* Italians are lazy: when women are present.\r\n* The British are lazy: when there's a bar within 5 miles.\r\n* Americans are lazy: when they're not working.\r\n* The French are lazy: all the time.\r\n\r\nSeriously though, [5+ weeks of vacation](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0922052.html), in combination with a 35 hour work week, is crazy.  In my past work environments, 60 hours/week happens more often than not.\r\n\r\nEurope has taught me to slow down a lot, but not quite that much :)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u4ag","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165600759,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"furyg3","id":"cu57h","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u4ag","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808100,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16510-6b0017cc-303a-4f22-94d9-c783c8b1d89e-1566236763"}

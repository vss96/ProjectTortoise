Due to the extreme influx of foreign investment in Thailand, the dollar is actually cheap there, and their local currency is overvalued. This is an attempt by their Central Bank to ensure that the bhat won't be devalued severely when the investment stops or when foreign investors decide to take back their profits and force a currency crisis. The high interest rate in Thailand is making foreign investment profitable, while artificially keeping the value of bhat high. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A POSSIBLE PLUNGE IN US DOLLARS. As a side note, the dollar is already in historically low levels.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vcwo","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39832-6174be28-5280-4d4e-9996-0b329070cd63-1566236773"}

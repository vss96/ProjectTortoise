{"controversiality":0,"body":"Heh, I don't think you know one thing about Lisp.  What's this BS about \"one big lambda function.\"  What kind of moron would write like that?\r\n\r\nI'd love to develop a game in Lisp.  It would be so much better.  I used to hack with OpenGL in CMU Common Lisp, and let me explain why it's so much better than C++:\r\n\r\n  INTERACTIVITY.\r\n\r\nYou can CHANGE YOUR GAME while PLAYING IT.  Recompile code on the fly!  Add new functionality.  Inspect objects at runtime.\r\n\r\nIt's sweet, and you can use all the OpenGL/glut/whatever functions just the same, or have a higher level interface.\r\n\r\nFsck C++.  Why go through such pain and suffering?\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uuzg","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":9,"ups":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166164628,"author":"ricercar","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuvbw","parent_id":"t1_cuv46","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808591,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29887-30b0ae67-be4b-4dd0-98f0-4e15577d9e60-1566236769"}

When you cook for yourself you prepare everything for a single meal, while a restaurant has to push out several different meals in a short period of time.  The way a restaurant differs from what you would do at home is that they will have the various components of the meal prepared (but not \"cooked\") and ready to go so that to finish the meal all they need to do is finish cooking everything, combine the elements on the plate, and get it out the door.\r\n\r\nThe vegetables will all be blanched or par-cooked so that they can be finished quickly, the sauces (or at least the sauce bases) will be ready to go, etc.\r\n\r\nFor a software equivalent, think about the difference between using a LAMP stack and ajax library that is combined with a small bit of content to make unique site vs. rolling your own web server from libwww and using some javascript \"recipes\" to achieve a specific effect.  The former is what a restaurant does while the latter is what you do at home.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51736-6417294f-9b27-41d8-859c-18b217412850-1566236778"}

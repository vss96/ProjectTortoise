([Action] should have an arrow pointing back to [External-Event], and [Conclusion] back to [Interpritation]).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that what people refer to as the \"Will\" are the above diagramed feedback loops.  That is \"The Will\" is not the External Event, the ability to Interpret an event, or to draw a Conclusion, or even to Act.... The Will is the Loop itself.  This makes The Will a dynamic real-time system, not a static capacity.\r\n\r\nAs Frank Herbert points out in \"Children of Dune\": It is imposable to understand a dynamic system by stopping it.  To that end, while we can never be 100% free of external influences, it is very possible to envision a situation where peculiarities of the processes of Interpretation, and Conclusion, unique to an individual's reasoning process, self-reinforce through each successive iteration of the loop such that the end-action is far more a product of those accumulated peculiarities than it is of all external influences.  \r\n\r\nFurther, the processes of Interpretation, and Conclusion can also serve as \"External Events\" that in turn can lead to action that might alter the manner by which future Interpretations and Conclusions are made.  That is to say: One's actions are not limited in scope to external phenomena, but can be used to change the methods by which one interprets data, arrives at conclusions, and thus alter the dynamics of the feedback loops that gave rise to the action in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis self-reinforcing nature of the will, allowing it to alter it's own future behavior in a manner far more dominated by it's current and past behavior than external pressures is how the Will can be said to be Free.\r\n\r\n* edit to get the diagram to render more-or-less correctly","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vf8l","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":2,"score":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166734367,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44197-5d997540-26b0-49ad-909e-82f6e2f896f9-1566236774"}

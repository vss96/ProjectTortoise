{"controversiality":0,"body":"Because many people still trust doctors implicitly. They are told they need a med, get a prescription, take it to the pharmacist and gets it filled. They assume that all of these highly trained people are going to do the right thing. Some people are intimidated by docs, some are shy, some assume that of course the doc and the pharmacist will watch out for them - after all that's their job. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor should ensure that what they're writing can be understood and the pharmacist should ask what the condition is and think about whether what they *think* the med is fits with the condition... else what good are they?\r\n\r\nShould people do what you do? Yeah. But for various reasons not everyone will and continuing with the silly practice of scrawling text on a pad when we have far better methods of communicating critical information is just asinine.","link_id":"t3_td5k","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165094194,"score":5,"ups":5,"author":"corwin","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctdjl","parent_id":"t1_ctdi8","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807583,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3811-3a009450-ada4-4ca8-a7ba-f6141c55aed0-1566236759"}

{"controversiality":1,"body":"Your opinion is stupid and willfully ignorant of reality, damn near delusional. Even so, whichever assface modded you down should have his nuts squashed. So I modded you up.\r\n\r\nThe 37 year old man, had he been in prison so long, will end up being a real sociopath. Who can spend 2 decades in a prison without becoming one, short of those rare saints that only show up in touching prison movies?\r\n\r\nBut, this isn't fair to your argument. Your argument supposes that there can be a better outcome if they don't send him away for that amount of time.\r\n\r\nWhat then? He should feel no discomfort at all for taking someone's life? Maybe send him to detention and make him attend therapy twice a week? Some psychologist can bill the state $300 an hour leading the kid to make up excuses about how he did it because momma wouldn't let him have the candy bar in the grocery store checkout line?\r\n\r\nIncarceration can't bring the man back to life. It can't fix this kid's soul either. But lack of it will cause real problems. People will die without it. We don't go to the zoo, and say \"that tiger's been locked up long enough, the things change so much, maybe he'll behave like a kitten!\". We sure as hell better not do the same for animals even more dangerous.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_trhc","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165369567,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cts03","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctru1","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807855,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10441-f683ec4b-c328-46c1-8aa0-d5c4758764c2-1566236761"}

I refer you to a history book called Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives by Alan Bullock.  Hitler was Roman Catholic and Stalin was Russian Orthodox (both were Christian). Stalin was kicked out of the Seminary school (attended in tiflis from 1894 to 1899) in his fifth year for being too activist.  The school encouraged students to inform on each other and this led him to be very distrustful (he also suffered an abusive drunken father which likely contributed to his distrustful nature).  That led him to purge many military and church leaders once he came to power, but it didn't turn him into an Atheist.  In fact, after the war he declared the Russian Orthodox Church to be the state church.  This was the result of his Christian upbringing, his mother wanted him to become a priest and he nearly did.  Far be it for many people to pay attention to truth when slurring and dehumanising people, countries, and even philosophies they wish to hate.  A lie not corrected, told often enough, becomes generally accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v6h2","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166490623,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"score":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37251-3f9eb815-d69a-43a0-9274-f9a89c82bf94-1566236772"}

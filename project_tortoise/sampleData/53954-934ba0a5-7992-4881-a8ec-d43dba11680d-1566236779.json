But then, Dick still had some sense of decenecy.  And Ford pardoned Tricky Dick.  But he didn't pardon Nixon for Nixon.  He pardoned him for a good of the country.  And history has appeared to say that it was the correct thing to do now.   It was time to move on.  \r\n\r\nNow, the current occupant of the White House isn't as good as Nixon.  Nixon, in his own demented way cared about America.   But Bush and Company... they haven't studied enough history to care or not care about America.     I miss Ford.  I even miss Nixon a little now a days.","created_utc":1167261745,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cw51e","edited":false,"id":"cw76e","author_flair_text":null,"author":"davidreiss666","retrieved_on":1473809505,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"53954-934ba0a5-7992-4881-a8ec-d43dba11680d-1566236779"}

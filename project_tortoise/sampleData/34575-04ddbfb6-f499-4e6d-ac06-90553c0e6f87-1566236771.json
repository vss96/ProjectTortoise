It would make marriage &amp; divorce laws a lot easier. I have a lawyer friend that was saying here in CA we have TONS of laws that very carefully skirt around calling it \"marriage\" and call it a \"civil union.\"\r\n\r\nGo ahead and legalize it. I'd rather see gay people marry than see more drugs legalized.\r\n\r\nIt's backwards anyway - if I was a gay man, I could cover my partner under my medical insurance. But since i am not, I cannot extend coverage to my girlfriend.

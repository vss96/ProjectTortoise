Every time you come across a story that includes non-public information from a US government source, make a little mark on a piece of paper.  At the end of the week, see how many marks you have.  My guess would be at least 30.\r\n\r\nIn each of these cases, the source is breaking a promise that he or she signed when accepting government employment.  Sometimes out of the goodness of his or her own hard.  But generally not without some political advantage.\r\n\r\nEach of these stories will have an enormous effect on everyone working on the problem.  Have you ever worked on anything that was the subject of an NY Times article?  Then you know.\r\n\r\nYes, I was exaggerating.  The US still has some secrets.  But not many.\r\n\r\nFor Baker and the Saudis, see [here](http://scoop.epluribusmedia.org/story/2006/12/13/15227/165).  For a discussion of Leverett, Syria, and Iran, see [here](http://lebop.blogspot.com/2006/01/appeasing-iran-leverett-on-us-iran.html).\r\n\r\nNo, it is not precisely that these people are personally corrupt, any more than Bush or Cheney is.  Every single one of them means well and thinks he is right.  They are just aligned with certain perspectives as a result of their personal experiences and backgrounds.  If anything, this is the cause, not the result, of the financial connections.\r\n\r\nWhat I worry about with attitudes like yours is the enormous credibility you ascribe to people who are praised in official organs like the NYT, versus the enormous suspicion you apply to people who are condemned by it.  I would find a consistent approach of either credulence or paranoia much more attractive than this double standard, which places enormous trust and power in the hands of people simply because of their institutional affiliation.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vq1i","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46890-729c380d-2091-4920-b203-4a2b48756cde-1566236775"}

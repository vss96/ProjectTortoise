Its a nightmare.  But why resort to such artifice?  Most people people are in the middle: aborting and taking to term can both be unthinkable, sometimes.  They are both emotionally ugly choices.  But our laws give at least some deference to the pregnant mother before stepping in and taking over her body.  Such legal intervention is as nightmarish as your story.  For the government to take over the decision is an act of violence as much as abortion may seem to be (since nobody on this earth has the wisdom or scientific insight to really say what kind of \"life\" a fetus is - somewhere between a person, a potential person, and a blob of cells).  The woman should be able to speak for the sake of the potential person and for herself.  So contribute something realistic to the discussion instead of invidious nightmare stories which bear no relationship to reality.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tc0e","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165065975,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3193-2c6b8dd0-0ed5-4de3-a60b-a8129123a752-1566236759"}

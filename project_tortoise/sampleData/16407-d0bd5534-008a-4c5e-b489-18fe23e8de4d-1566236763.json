I even start by saying \"This is a thinking question, not a coding question.\"\r\n\r\nEven if the code is wrong, sometimes people don't code well on a white board, you can see if they're thinking by asking the following questions:\r\n\r\n1- How would you test this?\r\n2- What is the run time? \r\n3- Given the language used for implementations, what was easier/better versus another language?\r\n4- Can you think of an alternate way of solving this problem?\r\n\r\nPeople you want to hire tend to draw diagrams, notes and random scribbles as they work.  They're also objective about what they produced and will be honest if the solution is suboptimal, even if they can't grasp a better solution during the interview.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808097,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cu4o1","id":"cu51d","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16407-d0bd5534-008a-4c5e-b489-18fe23e8de4d-1566236763"}

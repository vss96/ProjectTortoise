Wham! You ARE right. You are absolutlely right! I mean it! The point of my article wasn't - doctors are a$$holes, most of the doctors I've had or met were great. If that's the way it came across to you I do need to modify it. The reason I listed the Gall bladder complications was to illustrate what I wasn't told. The only way I found this information was to dig for the answers years later when my brother had his problem. You see, from my background we were never taught to question authority figures like doctors even though they don't know everything. I mean they are human, like the rest of us and sometimes they make mistakes, right? So you need to ask questions. Never trust blindly. That's my point. And you're right about the colon cancer thing. It wasn't the doctors fault he didn't tell me, he didn't know. What I should say is this - When you make a big medical decision there may be long term complications no body knows about yet. Not even your doctor.\r\nThanks starwarrior.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807992,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctzbn","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctygn","author":"solson","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13752-e74e4a14-9b09-422d-9d5f-ba91027440a4-1566236762"}

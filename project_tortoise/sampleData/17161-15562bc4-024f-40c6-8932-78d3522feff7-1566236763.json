But it does seem to be a feature common to Chinese students in general.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u3fx","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808123,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"feijai","parent_id":"t3_u3fx","edited":false,"id":"cu6bd","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17161-15562bc4-024f-40c6-8932-78d3522feff7-1566236763"}

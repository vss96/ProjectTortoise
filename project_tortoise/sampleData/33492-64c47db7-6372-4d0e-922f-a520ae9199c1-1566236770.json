{"controversiality":0,"body":"Well, you are technically correct that its not *directly* pegged to the dollar. Now, it is pegged to a \"basket of currencies\" (the dollar being the main egg in the basket of course). \r\n\r\nAnd the truth is they keep a very tight band on it - only letting it deviate 2 to 3% from that \"basket\". It is not \"free floating\" however.\r\n\r\nNow to answer your question; It would help them and hurt them. Domestically it would hurt them - oil prices would soar. Internationally it would help them with respect to trade. \r\n\r\nThe real point to all of this, is that a cheaper dollar does not affect the US all that much (after all oil is still traded in dollars) - especially if our main trading partners currency falls commensurate with us.\r\n\r\nThis conversation is getting to the core, of why these types of \"OMG, CHINA CRASH TEH DOLLAR!!!\" articles are so mind-numbingly stupid.","link_id":"t3_v0o4","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166337542,"score":0,"ups":0,"author":"econo","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv36b","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv2o2","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808740,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33492-64c47db7-6372-4d0e-922f-a520ae9199c1-1566236770"}

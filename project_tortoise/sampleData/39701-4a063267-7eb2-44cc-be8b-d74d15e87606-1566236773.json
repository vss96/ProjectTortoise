{"body":"I'm glad you liked it. :-)\r\n\r\nI'd like to point out that the heavy-lifting in my program is being done by the SXML libararies (the \"ssax\" and \"sxml-tools\" modules in Chicken) -- they are doing the parsing and the XPath queries. The syntax of my Hart minilanguage (e.g. (a (@ (href \"/\")) \"Home\")) is heavily influenced by SXML syntax. So, while I'm happy to share my code, the lion's share of the work was done by other, brighter minds.\r\n\r\nI agree with your \"50 lines is short enough\" conclusion. I felt that I had written my version at \"about the right size.\" No need to wedge it into an unnecessarily smaller space.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing your HXT example; hoping to see more in the future.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_vebh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166571776,"author":"gmfawcett","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cvfgn","parent_id":"t1_cvexz","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808972,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39701-4a063267-7eb2-44cc-be8b-d74d15e87606-1566236773"}

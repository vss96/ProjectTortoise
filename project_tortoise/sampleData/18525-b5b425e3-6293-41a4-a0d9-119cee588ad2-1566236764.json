There is a _huge_ bureaucracy in government and the private sector--literally millions of people--who do nothing but handle a transfer of money from one place to another. And, unsurprisingly, most of the money winds up in the middleman's pocket.\r\n\r\nCharles Murray proposed replacing all government \"charity\" with a single distribution of 10,000 per person. (Nothing new there--the left has often wanted such a thing.) But his idea is specifically to destroy the middleman. A view from the left:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.crookedtimber.org/2006/06/01/charles-murrays-in-our-hands-left-or-right/\r\n\r\nWhen you give to charity, you are giving to two groups:\r\n\r\n1) The presumably indigent (the starving of Africa, AIDS victims, etc)\r\n\r\n2) The presumably able-bodied (the office-workers who move the money, send out advertisements, do PR, talk around the water cooler, etc.)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Actually, his purpose was also to force responsibility upon people; instead of a government agent deciding what goods and services are provided, a person is forced to choose his own fate with his 10k.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u89o","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18525-b5b425e3-6293-41a4-a0d9-119cee588ad2-1566236764"}

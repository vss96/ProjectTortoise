{"body":"The reason why the whole world isn't using functional languages is very simple: shitty library support.  The real silver bullet for most programmers is access to large, high quality libraries, with the primary examples being the .NET runtime, or Java's libraries.  Programming tests that require writing 100% of the code from scratch are just flat out inaccurate, because you are measuring the wrong thing.  The bulk of modern development time isn't writing code from scratch.  It's writing code that interfaces with libraries for networking, or XML parsing, or database handling, or whatever (see http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LordPalmerston.html for a fuller treatment of this topic).  The functional programming language community is more interested in marginalizing their access to external systems rather than making it easier (research into monads being a great example of that).","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_twtt","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165519299,"score":10,"ups":10,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"petrov76","edited":false,"id":"cu0np","parent_id":"t3_twtt","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808017,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14354-d30c60cc-033a-4b7c-b4a0-aa90840a8bdf-1566236762"}

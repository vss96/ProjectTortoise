They were performed over 5 years in the 90s. Check out [DMT: The Spirit Molecule](http://www.blackclover.com.au/files/Rick.Strassman-DMT-The.Spirit.Molecule.2001.pdf)[pdf] for a full account of his studies.  It is possibly the most interesting non-fiction I have ever read.  Don't be confused by the title.  This isn't a new-age spirit-journey crystal worship book, but rather a detailed account written by a scientist.\r\n\r\nDMT is fascinating, as is psilocybin, and I would highly recommend it to anybody that likes to perfom these sorts of experiments in the comfort of their own home.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vdx0","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166560162,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39206-fee69e23-10a1-4f55-9df3-2eaed8cac219-1566236773"}

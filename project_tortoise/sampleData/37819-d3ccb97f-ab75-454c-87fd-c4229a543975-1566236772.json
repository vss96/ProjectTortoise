The idea is that it the universe is not only constantly expanding, but that the expansion is accellerating, then eventually everything will start to move away from everything else at (reletive to the other thing) faster than the speed of light. That is, since the other side of the universe is expanding so quickly away from you, the amount of universe actually within speed-of-light distance from you keeps shrinking, until eventually subatomic particles within individual atoms are no longer within speed of light distance of each other. This causes some seriously fucked up amounts of Strong and Weak Nuclear force energy to be released, so much energy that the laws of physics totally break down, everything goes crazy for an unspecified period of time (as time has broken itself), and then the universe begins again via huge hard-to-explain explosion.\r\n\r\nThe above is, of course, an entirely casual explaination. Real scientists doen't refer to Strong and Weak Nuclear forces as \"seriously fucked up\".","link_id":"t3_vb4k","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808903,"distinguished":null,"author":"connor","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvbsb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvbmq","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37819-d3ccb97f-ab75-454c-87fd-c4229a543975-1566236772"}

Ever wondered how to rappel down the side of nine stacked shipping containers with a bomb-sniffing German shepherd dog strapped to your chest? Blackwater can teach you. \r\n\r\nI laughed :)\r\n\r\nThat said, I think Blackwater is an excellent addition in the US Arsenal.  As the article mentions, Blackwater employees are unathroized to run offensive operations.  As such, they can be employed to protect infrastructure, VIPs or provide logistical support while freeing American troops to actually go after terrorists.  This combination can only mean that our troops will finish the job and be home sooner.\r\n\r\nThat said, I will never deny that there are rotten apples among military contractors just like there are in any other organization.  However, you are not going to scrap the entire government of the US because we have one President you think is lousy, now are you?","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vg01","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809042,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Eugi","edited":false,"id":"cvizb","parent_id":"t3_vg01","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41455-f51138e9-9437-432d-8b97-850fee339d4b-1566236773"}

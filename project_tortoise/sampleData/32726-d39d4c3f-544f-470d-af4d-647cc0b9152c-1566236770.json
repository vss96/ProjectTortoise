If you use continuations to 'rewind' to a previous state, all mutations of mutable objects are not 'rewinded' and this creates lots of opportunities for errors. It's similar to the synchronization issues we have with multiple threads. \r\n\r\nIn a referential transparent language this won't happen. You can simply go back to a certain state or resume another without having to worry about side-effects.\r\n\r\nFor mutable languages some kind of transactions based system which captures the whole mutable state of a certain part of a program would be of better use (but I can't imagine how to integrate this into Java).\r\n","link_id":"t3_v0d8","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166300307,"score":4,"ups":4,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32726-d39d4c3f-544f-470d-af4d-647cc0b9152c-1566236770"}

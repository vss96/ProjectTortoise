But not in the same way.\r\n\r\nThere are beliefs and groups for which the act of believing or being a member is a significant focus, and in these groups it seems common that those who believe are encouraged to make promises to continue to do so, and pushed in the direction of considering their current agreement with the underlying premise to be part of the definition of themselves, so that it is hard to change.\r\n\r\nIt's not only organised religion which does this, I guess - thinking about it, things like \"Silver Ring Thing\" do it too. Yes, that's run and motivated by religion, but it's not a religious belief, it's just another case of taking a statement to some children, and getting those who agree with it to promise that they always will.\r\n\r\nSome atheists may feel more comfortable if those they care about hold the same opinion, much like lifelong Democrat voters, or people who think soccer is a rubbish sport. But atheism is just a belief about the world, not a belief about belief - no part of it is a commitment to continue to think this thing, or threats of what will happen to you if you stop thinking this thing. It's not your identity, it's just what you think right now.\r\n\r\nSo the statement you suggest an atheist parent might come out with is possible, much as \"Don't disappoint me someday by playing soccer, son, play a real sport!\" is possible. But it's not backed up by the same framework of believing in a belief which is itself about belief.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165852747,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22448-0d65b003-1141-438f-b9f7-e415af9dd000-1566236766"}

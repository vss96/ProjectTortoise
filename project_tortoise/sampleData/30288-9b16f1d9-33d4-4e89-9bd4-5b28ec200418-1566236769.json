He's been dramatically wrong on just about every major issue during the Bush administration. Based on that track record alone I would caution Obama to do just the opposite.\r\n\r\nServe a term or two in the Senate, especially a democratic Senate where you can do real legislation and then run for office. Running now just invites a fight with Hillary.\r\n\r\nHowever if Hillary doesn't start to come forward with some results for her tenure, I'm not sure she'll be getting my vote. \r\n\r\n[BTW if you are a redditor and you would rather watch Obama's speech first hand rather than rate it 2nd hand based on the slobberings of George Will you can see it here.](http://reddit.com/info/uo6s/comments)","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30288-9b16f1d9-33d4-4e89-9bd4-5b28ec200418-1566236769"}

The dream was that Iraq would become a prosperous nation, friends with the US and an inspiration to all the Islamic countries. \"What a great democracy we have, and we owe it all to the USA! They're not trying to convert us all to Christianity, they just want everyone to be free!\" The rest of the Middle East would emulate them and forge ties with us, the bad countries would worry that they were next and go along with us out of fear, and a generation from now, it would be as successful and America-friendly as Japan.\r\n\r\nUnforatunately, it doesn't look like it's going to work out that way. But i think that was the dream. In particular, WMDs and oil never had anything to do with it. I think WMDs were just an excuse, a means to get to an end that we thought was noble, and i think oil had nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the big mistakes made were to underestimate how hard it would be to form a peaceful democracy in the region, and how much the rest of the world would hate us for acting like an empire. The latter, in particular, was far too high a price to pay for the slim chance we have of pulling off the dream.","link_id":"t3_u9by","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19193-a1f0793f-4772-494a-9bb3-1e198a2042fe-1566236764"}

I believe the princess is a generic symbol for a powerful nubile female, but that how they are interpreted depends on the people who’re casting themselves. For example my friend was an innocent princess lost, in her fantasies, who would be rescued by an indulgent royal family. I saw myself as the diplomat, who would prove her worth in the court of the troll king and later, as I matured, lead rebellions to reclaim her country. Other girls I've talked to saw princess to mean 'spoiled diva'. One female I know rejected being princess all together for the role of a pageboy to defend her older sister, the princess. So I wish there was some sort of study because I don’t think the idea of princess is homogenous as one might think.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vwpr","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809340,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Phia","id":"cvyjc","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vwpr","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49322-4e3772de-7fde-4417-b064-3310195aee13-1566236777"}

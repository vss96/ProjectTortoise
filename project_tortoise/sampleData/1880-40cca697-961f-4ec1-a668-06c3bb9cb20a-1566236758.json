{"body":"SF_engineer, if the SF stands for San Francisco then you should know in California a law was just passed that makes talking on a cellphone (using a hand held phone) while operating a car illegal.  Though it hasn't gone into effect yet.  Honestly, I don't think the government did this to provide protection but rather to tax indirectly and make soccer moms feel safer.  The ticket is a small fine, something like 20 dollars.  But the bill doesn't outlaw distracting activities, like eating while driving, CB radios, shaving, putting on makeup, etc.  All of that is still fine.  The legeslation only outlaws cellphones.\r\n\r\nSadly a similar story just occurred in Los Angeles this morning. [A woman and two children were hit at a bus stop](http://cbs2.com/local/local_story_335121540.html)  The driver said he was reaching for his cell phone.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t8ou","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165001145,"author":"trivial","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ct94r","edited":false,"id":"ct9lj","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807510,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1880-40cca697-961f-4ec1-a668-06c3bb9cb20a-1566236758"}

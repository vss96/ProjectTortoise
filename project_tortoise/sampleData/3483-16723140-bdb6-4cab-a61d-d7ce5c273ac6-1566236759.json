Many times somebody will begin a side-discussion that you don't really want to read about and you have to scroll all the way to the end in order to skip it.\r\n\r\nA button (javascript or something) would be really handy for just collapsing those comments onto themselves. Of course if that was implemented an expand button would then also be needed to undo the hiding action.\r\n\r\nIf anybody has good programming skills and is capable of making a greasemonkey script or something I suppose that would work too, but I think that this idea would benefit a lot of people.\r\n\r\nDiscuss.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3483-16723140-bdb6-4cab-a61d-d7ce5c273ac6-1566236759"}

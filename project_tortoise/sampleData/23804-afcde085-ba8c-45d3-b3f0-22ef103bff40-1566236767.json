It reminds me of the book \"Rape of the Masters\" by Roger Kimball. (If you haven't had a chance to read it, I suggest you do.)\r\n\r\nOne the principle problems you face in sharing your opinion on this topic is that you are in essence communicating a value: that something isn't relative. In our culture, having values can often be translated as being intolerant and therefore bigoted and undesirable.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the problem with art today--I'm speaking particularly of abstract art--is that it is valueless or value neutral. Therefore, there is little room for discussion about taste because there is nothing to taste.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ufsk","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":2,"score":2,"created_utc":1165887760,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"23804-afcde085-ba8c-45d3-b3f0-22ef103bff40-1566236767"}

The PHP code was started in Dreamweaver as a prototype and became an unmaintainable mess.  When I lost my 2nd developer, I re-wrote the whole app in RoR by myself, changed the DB model significantly, and integrated a new graphic design in much less time than it would have taken me to re-do it in PHP.  30k lines of PHP became 6k lines of Ruby and 10k lines of view code/HTML.  Now I can do things in a week of part-time coding that would take others a month or more.  My site has 12,000 registered users and has generated over 100k in revenue.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w0ju","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809409,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"stalcottsmith","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_w0ju","id":"cw283","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51191-7061d830-03e5-42b7-98ac-43d8746e33f4-1566236778"}

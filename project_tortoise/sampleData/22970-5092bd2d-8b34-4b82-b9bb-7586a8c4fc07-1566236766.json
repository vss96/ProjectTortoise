I would agree that anarchy is a pretty good starting point.  However, people are far more ingenious about usurping power than you appear to give credit for - government monopoly is only one kind of monopoly.  When Europeans first came to America, there was really  no government monopoly.  Rather, there were people with guns, there were people who got there first, and the ensuing land grab has yielded power bases that remain essentially intact today, 300-400 years later.  In addition to government monopolies, there are resource monopolies and expertise monopolies to contend with.  Standard oil killed off competition using strategies that required no government monopoly for assistance.  When two local powers find competing against a third difficult, it's natural for them to merge and then crush the third, resulting in a new, permanent concentration of power.  Repeat that process enough times, and you end up recreating all the power structures that have been created in the history of humans.  Family/tribal power bases, religious-based, city/state, nation-state, etc.  I don't think there's a single, principle-based solution that can successfully prevent any and all end-runs humans will inevitably try to make around the prevailing system.  In the end, we need a hard-edged pragmatism that recognizes the price of freedom is eternal vigilance, safeguards, checks and balances, the occasional smack-down, and not-so-occasional dismemberment of power bases.","link_id":"t3_ubuw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165865287,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"22970-5092bd2d-8b34-4b82-b9bb-7586a8c4fc07-1566236766"}

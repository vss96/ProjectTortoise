There is still a kind of recoil, but it is gradual instead of instantaneous. The \"contraption\" (gun) is given an angular force by the motors spinning up the barrel. So if someone holds it in the stocks illustrated in the video, it will in addition to its weight yield a continuous force against the palm of the wielder. Since the bullet is gradually accelerated to its muzzle velocity, the recoil is also gradual. There is no change in bullet velocity the instant it leaves the gun, hence there is no opposite force working from the bullet on the gun in the instant of firing.","link_id":"t3_w4nn","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809477,"distinguished":null,"author":"marvin","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw5p8","parent_id":"t1_cw4xj","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53105-966498c9-7028-417e-a2ca-102083b7647d-1566236778"}

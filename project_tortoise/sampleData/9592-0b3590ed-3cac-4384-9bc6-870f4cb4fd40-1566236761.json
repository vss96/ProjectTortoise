I lived in Saudi for half a year and, indeed, shop and stall owners leave their merchandise unattended, go do whatever pressing business they need, and come back to it after an hour or so. You only appreciate that difference when you go back to a place like England and then see how too fast and often your stuff can be \"nicked\"; you name it, a phone or an umbrella you leave at a table while you go to the toilette only to find it's gone when you're back, a jacket you leave on your chair while you get another book from the shelves at the library, a Halloween pumpkin at your doorstep that your girlfriend meticulously cleaned and carved over a day or two and decorated with a candle gone within ~10 minutes or so of being put there. I even recall that in Amsterdam I got distracted for a couple of minutes I was at a payphone by talking to a passerby I had met before and when I looked back to the payphone the phone card was gone! It's just ludicrous.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165345802,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_ctpg8","id":"ctqfi","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ooouuuurrrriiiii","retrieved_on":1473807827,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9592-0b3590ed-3cac-4384-9bc6-870f4cb4fd40-1566236761"}

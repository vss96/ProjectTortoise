When ambushed, SOPs dictate that a heavy weight of fire is to be laid down to either side of the convoy, and all vehicles are to accelerate to full speed until out of the KZ other than the front marker, who is to turn and provide supp. fire to the rest of the convoy if possible. Here, everyone just seemed to drive on, despite the fact that in the case of ambush, indiscriminate suppressive fire is not only permitted but encouraged.

Take a seat. I'm turning 40 in two months, my (american, btw) employer just kicked me out of an IT job I held for 13 years, because they are restructuring IT to operate from the United Kingdom. They didn't bother to ask me if I'd go to the UK. I might have. Nope. They just kicked me in time for christmas (albeit I'm an atheist, so please don't cry over the bitterness okay).\r\n\r\nThere's next to no chance I'd ever get a similar job again. I'm just too frakkin' old.  However, I'm taking this as an opportunity to try something new. Getting self-employed in an area unrelated to IT. Damn this autumn day in 1983 when I bought that Commodore 64 from my first self-earned money :-D\r\n\r\nIt's likely that I will fail with that, but what the hell. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. So far I've always been on the winning side, at least from my self-centered, egoistic point of view. *shrugs*\r\n\r\nEDITED for spelling.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52250-1074f0e8-d197-4924-b4f6-c73f1f020582-1566236778"}

{"body":"Here's a few examples of FDA/USDA incompetence and meddling causing serious health problems:\r\n\r\n1) The FDA regularly blocks beneficial techniques/technologies from being used. For example the FDA prevented for decades the us of irradiation to eliminate e coli bacteria from meat products, despite it being used for years in other countries with no side effects, thus causing many preventable illnesses and deaths.\r\n\r\n2) The FDA generally lags far behind in implementing safer food standards. For instance, it is the *food industry* that is cutting way back on trans-fats as evidence mounts that they are very unhealthy. FDA bureaucrats are now jumping in and screaming for superfluous laws so they can claim responsibility for the reduction of trans-fats in foods.\r\n\r\n3) The FDA prevents accurate labeling. They [prohibit meat producers from identifying their products as being screened for mad cow disease](http://blog.mises.org/blog/archives/002566.asp). They prevent vegetable producers from labeling their produce as non GMO. They prevent producers from claiming scientifically proven health benefits on their labels.\r\n\r\nAnd it goes on and on.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w9wu","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167353458,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":-1,"score":-1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoFixedAbode","parent_id":"t1_cwavv","edited":false,"id":"cwb5n","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809579,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55944-452d0568-9224-4c7a-b0db-b91bc3096f47-1566236779"}

But for variables and function names, you have to type it out a bunch, so you should make it no longer than it needs be. With `fibonacci` there's already no ambiguity. (What else would `fibonacci` possibly do besides generate fibonacci numbers?) So, you may as well not make it needlessly long.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166097706,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"cur7p","parent_id":"t1_cur5p","author_flair_text":null,"author":"earthboundkid","retrieved_on":1473808514,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27832-0b61c451-a38f-47da-8414-0aea303e462f-1566236768"}

In any case, if you want to object to my attibution of rights to a state, that's fine with me.  It honestly sounded a bit odd to me as I was typing it.  In any case, I don't think it affects the argument, because the state uses its *authority* to further its own interests and sometimes those interests would not be furthered by the exercise of that authority to its fullest extent.  In my example, we would say that the state, through its agents, was acting unreasonably, even though it was exercising its authority to no greater extent than allowed.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, I suspect part of what motivates me here is that whenever I hear about citizens living in truly oppresive governments, I'm affected more by sympathy for the citizens than anger at the government.  The two are often intertwined, but here we have an example were they can be pretty clearly divided.  I know this isn't much of an objective argument, and I don't expect to convince anyone by this, but if I had to be honest with you I'd say that my reaction is affected by the fact that I just don't feel badly for this kid.  \r\n\r\nAlso, though no one has said this explicitly, I often encounter people with the attitude that it doesn't matter *at all* how the victim of police malfeasance acts, as long as he acted within his rights.  I just think that a good policy would be to punish these cops less than you would a cop who acted the same way to a very polite and cooperative motorist.  If you think a cop acting like this without provocation should be punished more harshly, then you have to admit that the driver's actions are at least somewhat relevant.  I know you never claimed his behavior was completely beside the point, but that's not an uncommon attitude in these situations and I don't really understand it.","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wgpl","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809699,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mpecsek","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwhfr","id":"cwhk9","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59087-2088df73-1881-438d-914f-2e252c65e95e-1566236780"}

{"body":"When I was 12 or so, I realized during the school day that I had matches in my pocket from camping over the weekend.  I threw them away, but stupidly mentioned it to a friend of mine.  He told a friend of his (but not mine), who dug them out of the trash and turned them in to the principal.  I got called in and chewed out for over an hour, threatened with suspension, etc, etc, for bringing matches to school.  I tried to explain to him that I threw them out as soon as I found them, but he didn't seem to care (or was intent on trying to scare me).  WTF?  Luckily they didn't try to take it farther, but I could've easily been in the same situation as this kid.  Public school authorities are about as braindead as airport screeners.  Letter of the law is all they care about.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uvo6","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166227514,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jimbobhickville","id":"cuza6","parent_id":"t3_uvo6","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808667,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31720-7f3f82d3-66d1-4e9a-a0c6-8c3ceea19ee6-1566236770"}

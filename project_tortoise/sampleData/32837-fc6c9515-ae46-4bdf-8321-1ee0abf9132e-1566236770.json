Even if the author of this paper did  disprove evolution, which he didn't, that in no way proves that God created the universe. To suggest that intelligent design created life one would have to create a falsifiable hypothesis and then test it hundreds of times. The fact that this was published shows a complete lack of understanding of the way the scientific method works, and so the guy in question deserves to be fired.","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v1v6","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808718,"author":"Alex3917","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv1zr","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cv1yx","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32837-fc6c9515-ae46-4bdf-8321-1ee0abf9132e-1566236770"}

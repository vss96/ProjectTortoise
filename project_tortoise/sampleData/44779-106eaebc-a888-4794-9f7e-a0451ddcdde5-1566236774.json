If you do not think it is such, you will have to explain yourself better, instead of repeating yourself again and again.  You grow tiresome, and you get nowhere.  Though I have to say, I don't think mangleon's original comment, \"'\"Man, I really hate blacks, it must be their fault.'\" made a lot of sense, either... I guess he/she meant we are putting the cart before the horse - or the chicken before the egg - or something... he/she is saying because we already hate Israel we will see everything Israel does as bad?  Now what does your comment have to do with that?  Do you see how tangential your comment is?","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vija","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44779-106eaebc-a888-4794-9f7e-a0451ddcdde5-1566236774"}

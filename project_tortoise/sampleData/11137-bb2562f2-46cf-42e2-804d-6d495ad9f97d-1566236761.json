{"body":"When asked recently about Iraq, George Bush said “we’re winning and we will win unless we leave before the job is done.”\r\n\r\nThis seemingly ludicrous statement made me wonder if the president had lost track of the facts. I was stumped by his stubborn insistence until I realized that I have no idea whether it is true or not because I don’t know how Bush defines success. By my definition we are not winning the war in Iraq or the purported war on terror. But could it be that we are winning by his definition?...How, I wondered, could the president say we are winning? What is his definition of success in Iraq and what factors does he consider? \r\nAnd then the simplicity of his reasoning hit me. The “we” he is referring to is not the American or Iraqi people or even the terrorists. The “we” he talks about are his friends and family members — the wealthy upper echelon who invested heavily in this war. He is talking about corporate America and CEOs. He is talking about those represent the oil industry. He is talking about the Iraqi “dissidents,” like Ahmad Chalabi, who helped create this chaos.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ttca","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165398594,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"MALCOMR","id":"cttcf","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ttca","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807881,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11137-bb2562f2-46cf-42e2-804d-6d495ad9f97d-1566236761"}

He's really quite lucid at times but for some reason he's more than willing to sacrifice his intellect at the altar of his idealogy and that often makes him foolish at best and dangerous at worst.  Same with Bush.  Which DOESN'T however mean that *everything* he says should be dismissed out of hand.  \r\n\r\nMany of the people critizing his position on this are really just anti-Gingrich which is more than fine with me but I suspect that almost all of them would feel veeeerrrryyy differently if they were the ones who *might* come out on the shit end of the deal, no matter how unlikely that outcome might be.  That is evidenced by the fact that almost no one that has disagreed with or down modded my remarks have offered a viable alternative to what happened.  From the saftey of your laptops its easy to appear detached, sophisticated ,and logical but I think reality would show most of you to be hypocrites and I find it fascinating that so many of you can't own up to even the glimmer of a possibility that your lesser angels might be engaged if you were waiting to board that flight.  Even with the relative anonymity of this board a lot of you can't honestly consider your feelings.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v7ee","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166500825,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37489-28adb464-9ef9-4a7c-82f8-f7f18e656816-1566236772"}

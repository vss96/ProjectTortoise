There is a mad rush of money on R&amp;D now for energy production as well as conservation, this is going to impact heavily on the oil industry.  I could be wrong though, China and India may keep demand high.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807448,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct62v","id":"ct69m","author":"Fountainhead","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"239-a8073803-d4bd-48bd-9187-a6856d90a776-1566236758"}

The reason I found this article in the first place is that I'm looking to buy some cheap powered computer speakers that don't lose all the bass (like most do). I noticed that most of the lower end products have a frequency response range of 60Hz to 20kHz. A couple of offerings boasted ranges of 40Hz to 20kHz and even 35Hz to 20kHz. Now, despite what the article says, these should sound better than the 60Hz ones, won't they? I mean, they'll give better bass, won't they?","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167582327,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60238-f44291e9-f583-4b54-aee7-9665050823cc-1566236780"}

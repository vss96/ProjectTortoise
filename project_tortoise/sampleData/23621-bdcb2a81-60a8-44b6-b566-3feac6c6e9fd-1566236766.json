Okay, that last one's not science, but for a science writer, his record of being monumentally wrong about science is nothing short of incredible.  Think of him as the John Dvorak of Science.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uhgq","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808346,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"feijai","id":"cui4k","parent_id":"t1_cuhya","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23621-bdcb2a81-60a8-44b6-b566-3feac6c6e9fd-1566236766"}

Most lisp hackers i know    (that is to say, people who code a lot of CL, and/or make their living coding CL) are not perfectionists at all, but rather pragmatists. Lisp is not perfect, not by a long shot.\r\n\r\nMany programmers like having MTOWTDI. I'm sure the intersection of that set with the set of Lisp programmers is quite large, hence things like Macros, the MOP, programmable syntax, and all the other things that make lisp a language for people who are not afraid of doing something that does not have a \\\"well-defined way to do it\\\".\r\n\r\nLisp has both LOOP and recursion. Both FORMAT and WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING. CAR and FIRST, ELT and NTH. Why anyone who thinks as you describe would want to come near Lisp is beyond me.\r\n\r\nFeel free to speak for yourself, but using a meaningless term like \\\"people\\\" does nothing to get your point across.\")","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uefm","subreddit":"programming","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165879762,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"23554-345d081e-c3d7-48b8-a43c-01acf7060a99-1566236766"}

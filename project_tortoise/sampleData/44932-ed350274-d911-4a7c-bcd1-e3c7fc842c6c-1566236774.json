On the other hand, I own yellow rocks that look a lot like gold but aren't. You can tell a real chicken from a fake with your eye. To tell fake gold from real gold, you need to do fancy tests. That's why coins were invented. It was hard to press coins in those days, so it was usually a safe assumption that any pressed coin was made by the government hence 100% pure. (This wasn't always the case historically, but close enough.) However, even in those days, the only reason why a coin had value was that you had a safe assumption that you could either use the metal yourself or find someone else willing to buy it. In a post-apocalyptic economy, it's unlikely that you'll find anyone who wants to buy your gold unless they happen to be a jeweler or whatever, since they can't use it themselves and don't know anyone who can. So, whether you use gold or so-called \"fiat currency,\" the value of the money _always_ comes from the fact that you believe you can find someone else who is willing to trade for it. There's no difference between the two.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809175,"gilded":0,"id":"cvpuk","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvnlj","author":"earthboundkid","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44932-ed350274-d911-4a7c-bcd1-e3c7fc842c6c-1566236774"}

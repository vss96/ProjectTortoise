I prefer the latter. However, your description of the brain using things like 'shadows' to interpret the reflectance of objects isn't correct - though this may seem counterintuitive. The reason is that the concept of shadow is a post-hoc description of your perception of the world, and not an accurate description of the light that falls onto the eye. Indeed, the visual system has no direct access to surfaces or illuminants (shadow or otherwise) in the world, and so has no direct way of using a 'shadow' to generate it perception of the world. As such, seeing a surface's reflectance is mathematically impossible using the retinal image alone. Thus, all the brain has to go on are its statistics of what information 'meant' for behaviour in the past. It is these past behavioural significances that you're seeing.","link_id":"t3_t1z0","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164946321,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"513-7d044ded-898b-49e7-8eda-ed5534c98df7-1566236758"}

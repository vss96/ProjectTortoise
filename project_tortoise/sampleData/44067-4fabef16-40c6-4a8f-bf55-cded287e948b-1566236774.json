You can teach yourself to rationally identify things that would cause such cues and then maybe produce a counter-trigger. Say, maybe SS uniforms look really nifty but you train yourself to associate them with nastiness and unpleasantness. You train yourself to associate swim suited girls sprawled across sports cars as being a tool applied to \"suckers\" and thus feel all the negative emotion associated with the idea of a \"sucker\".\r\n\r\nWhile the negative associative training you describe does work, it requires a conscious effort and thus is not the primary mechanism that people use to control motivations.  Far more important is the simple fact that familiarity breeds contempt.  Much as you lost interest in the Winamp visualization plug-in, so one could lose one's interest or respect for a particular illusionistic visual device used by a painter.  Two Point Perspective doesn't raise our eyebrows anymore for example.  \r\n\r\nAs you point out there's little point in arguing definitions of common terms, but I think you suggested definition: \"that which conveys meaning in a non-rational sense\" has a serious problem in that an awful lot of art has nothing \"non-rational\" about it.  The Renaissance painters were intentionally creating rational art.  There is really almost nothing in the human condition that is truly \"non-rational\", perhaps you meant sub-conscious?\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44067-4fabef16-40c6-4a8f-bf55-cded287e948b-1566236774"}

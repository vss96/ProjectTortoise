For virtually every argument on one side of the fence, there's an equally valid argument on the other.\r\n\r\nThe best analysis we can do strongly suggests that human activities are the controlling factor. You’re saying that it doesn’t matter what the analysis says until it has all the facts, and from an academic point of view you’re right. But the risk is huge – we aren’t deciding how strongly to word the conclusion of a peer-reviewed paper, we’re realizing that we may have hundreds of millions of lives at stake.*** Beyond a certain amount of risk, waiting for absolute certainty is irrational and unethical.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if we’re contributing a significant amount to a catastrophe, even if we aren’t the contolling factor, we should knock it off. Any 10˚ (say) rise would be a big problem, and if it were perfectly natural it would be just as wise to try to stop it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, for me the best argument against a catastrophe is that it’s *easy* for people to believe that there’s a huge disaster coming which might be fended off by good behavior. Fear of impending eschaton goes back a long way. This doesn’t change my mind, of course. (I suspect we evolved that kind of fear for good reasons, even though most examples we can think of were stupid.)\r\n\r\n*** This is often overlooked: the worst-case scenario is not that some birds die out and people living on the waterfront have to buy new houses. It’s that the entire undeveloped world is hit by famines and mass displacements faster than the developed world can intervene. If Bangladesh floods, Southeast Asia is hit by big typhoons, or Sub-Saharan Africa has two drought years in a row, whole subcontinents could get like Darfur is now. We can’t (won’t) handle Darfur and we wouldn’t be able to handle that.\r\n\r\nEdit: formatting and typos.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vm6j","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809146,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"celoyd","id":"cvobe","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvnud","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44113-80dafbb6-75b0-4d48-860c-2d87f5a15c74-1566236774"}

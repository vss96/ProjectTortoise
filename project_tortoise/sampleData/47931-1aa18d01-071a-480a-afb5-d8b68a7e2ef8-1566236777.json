{"body":"I agree that static typing has some advantages for development over dynamic typing.  However, dynamic typing has substantial advantages over the 1950's era explicit static typing used in Java too.  Compare the complexity of generics in Java or C++ with generics in a dynamically typed language like Python.  It's so simple that you don't have to do anything.  Of course, you can achieve the same simplicity in a staticly typed language using Hindley-Milner type inferencing like Haskell or ML.\r\n\r\nFor the most productive language types for large projects, I'd first pick an implicitly static typed language (OCaml, SML), then a dynamicly typed language (Common Lisp, Python), and finally an explict staticly typed language (C#, Java.)  The ease of metaprogramming and 4-10:1 increase in code density in the first two language types more than makes up for the Java's environmental advantages.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vr55","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166918829,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"bquark","parent_id":"t1_cvvoo","id":"cvvs6","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809287,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"47931-1aa18d01-071a-480a-afb5-d8b68a7e2ef8-1566236777"}

Something that challenges the brain.\r\n\r\nI can't remember the last time I heard two women talking on public transport and it was beyond hair/date/hate boss/blah.\r\n\r\nOf course, it does maintain and train your social aptitude and social intelligence if you will. It doesn't make you a rocket scientist.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t48y","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164973878,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1005-e24f845c-52ff-4949-b67d-87c15d9bd5d0-1566236758"}

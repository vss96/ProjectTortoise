{"body":"The probability one is a good'en.\r\n\r\nIt comes down to the fact that the question assumes (but doesn't explicitly state) that there is a uniform distribution over the positive numbers, which the number in the envelope (a random variable) is drawn from.  The problem is that there is no way of defining such a distribution, even in abstract mathematical probability theory.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you fit an actual probability distribution (i.e. one with measure 1) to the set of outcomes, the statement\r\n\r\n&gt;because you could have just as easily picked the other envelope in the first place, but yet again it seems at first sight that the expected value of the other envelope is 1.25X\r\n\r\nbecomes false.  The probability of the other envelope being larger becomes less and less likely as the value revealed by the first envelope increases.  So you can no longer just add up and divide by two.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_veo0","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166637341,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"acrophobia","edited":false,"id":"cvime","parent_id":"t3_veo0","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809035,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41279-60226593-8655-4f9b-a87a-6d77f356e9a4-1566236773"}

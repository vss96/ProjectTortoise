{"controversiality":0,"body":"I bought a macbook in the spring and the hard drive died after about 4 months. Apple were willing to send me a new one by 48hr courier and let me replace it myself (changing a macbook drive is easier than swapping ram so I figured this was the fastest and safest way). \r\n\r\nI bought a macbook pro in the summer and saw the notification 3 months later that if there was any buzzing sound near the screen to call them. They asked me to send the machine in to them to get the motherboard replaced. They sent a box and shipped it from the UK to Holland or somewhere and replaced the motherboard + a whole bunch of other components and shipped it back _the next day_. \r\n\r\nThe same machine's hard drive then died 3 months later (6 months after purchase). HD replacement on the macbook pro is a horrible warranty-voiding job that requires more or less disassembling the whole thing (taking out the keyboard, unattaching ribbons all over the place etc). Apple told me I had to take the machine to a dealer to get it fixed. The dealer waited two weeks for a replacement drive from apple and then installed it on the same day (when I got the machine back it was with dirt all over the cable, box tatty and specks on the screen like someone choked on their coffee). \r\n\r\nI don't have applecare on either machine but that shouldn't make a difference to a dead hd type problem (in Europe at least). I thought the way apple dealt with the second hd failure was a disgrace and of course I'm now wondering if they have a bunch of bad laptop hd's.","link_id":"t3_wd3v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167417788,"score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"chu","id":"cwdq7","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wd3v","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809628,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57180-689a0aa1-71d5-44c4-bb92-54af6ff501ea-1566236779"}

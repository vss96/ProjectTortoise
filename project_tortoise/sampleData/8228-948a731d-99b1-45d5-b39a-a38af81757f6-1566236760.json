What?  Didn't the author just spend several paragraphs explaining how MS will  be playing a shrinking role in the OS market?\r\n\r\nIf MS won't loose any market share, then it follows that Vista probably won't be the \"last of its kind\"...\r\n\r\nOverall a poorly written article that seems to only be popular because it criticizes Microsoft.

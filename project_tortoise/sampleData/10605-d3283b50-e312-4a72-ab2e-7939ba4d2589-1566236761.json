The main principle I've heard is empathy: people behave civily to each other because they feel good when people they identify with also feel good.  But this principle doesn't seem very strong.  How can empathy rationally support one person dying for another?  They don't benefit at all from their action...Such a morality also would undermine discipline and striving hard in general.  And even more disturbing, it is the regimes based on atheistic thought that have been the most inhumane.  For a good portrayal of the problem here, see Joss Whedon's Serenity.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that I am not arguing for theism, although I do find theism more plausible.  I just don't see that atheism has a better effect on humanity, not that that necessarily matters.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tq6l","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165374844,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-8,"ups":-8,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10605-d3283b50-e312-4a72-ab2e-7939ba4d2589-1566236761"}

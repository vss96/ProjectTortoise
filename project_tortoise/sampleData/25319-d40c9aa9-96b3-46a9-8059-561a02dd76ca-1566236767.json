I came to school today and this was brought to my attention by one of my classmates.  I immediately ran to my computer and Googled it. As I watched it I was appalled at the actions of the UCLA police force. I think it was barbaric and the situation could have been handled in many better ways. I don’t know why Tabatabainejad was punished in such a dramatic way for actions that seemed very minor. I have read many things about Tabatabainejad and I believe that judgment was one of the major contributions in the actions of the police officer and that to me makes the situation much worse. I know you are aware of all of this already I just wanted to put in some impute because I feel very strongly that this was a crime that the police officers committed and no one else. And I am a strong believer that no crime or inappropriate action should go unpunished or at least unnoticed. I am willing to do anything I can to show my support for the students of UCLA and especial for Tabatabainejad and his family.\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_rhjm","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25319-d40c9aa9-96b3-46a9-8059-561a02dd76ca-1566236767"}

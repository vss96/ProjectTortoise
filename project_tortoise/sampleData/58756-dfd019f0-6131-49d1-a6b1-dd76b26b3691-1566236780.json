{"body":"This site was ridiculous. Not that it's not true that you can make money from a blog -- you can! However, the text on the website didn't wrap right and the text was also bleeding over into other cells. The moron is using non-standard HTML (needs to take a visit to the ol' W3C.org website and also test in at least IE and Firefox). Also, you should not just blog, but create other sites with a forum and something special on it in order to drive eyeballs there to those Google AdSense ads. The webhost I recommend is [hostgator.com](http://www.hostgator.com/) because you can affordably scale well with them and they have a lot of features for Linux PHP. Also, I recommend visiting [wickedfire.com](http://www.wickedfire.com/) to learn more about this new industry and get more advice to drive up cash from your sites.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wgna","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167497197,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"supermike","parent_id":"t3_wgna","id":"cwgrr","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809683,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"58756-dfd019f0-6131-49d1-a6b1-dd76b26b3691-1566236780"}

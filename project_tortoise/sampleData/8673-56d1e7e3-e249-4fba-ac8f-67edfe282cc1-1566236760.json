Why not just release the whole book? If people like it, it will be easier to get it published because you can just show publishers your download statistics. And once it's published, if you believe cory doctorow, you'll still be making money, even tho your giving the whole book away.\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tnlk","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807788,"author":"robbie","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cto79","id":"ctoes","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8673-56d1e7e3-e249-4fba-ac8f-67edfe282cc1-1566236760"}

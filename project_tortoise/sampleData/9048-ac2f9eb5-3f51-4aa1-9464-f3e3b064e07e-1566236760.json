Pot is in fact most used by people to self medicate for depression, and is in fact thought to be capable of curing IBS as those with IBS have a second type of caniboid receptor and it's been found out that stimulating that causes bowel repair. However they don't know why they have a second type, but the logical guess work is that these people evolved to have one from prolongued exposure to pot.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9048-ac2f9eb5-3f51-4aa1-9464-f3e3b064e07e-1566236760"}

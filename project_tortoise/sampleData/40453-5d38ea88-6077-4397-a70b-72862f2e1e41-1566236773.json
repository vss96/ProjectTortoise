{"body":"The strawman you're putting up is: that I'm supposedly arguing for letting him do whatever he wants to do. I'm only talking about his visitor logs, whether releasing that should be his decision or not.\r\n\r\nDo you think we should be able to make public his personal notes? His telephone records? Anything we want, because he's done a bad job?\r\n\r\nIn this instance there seems to be a loop hole through the secret service.\r\n\r\nYou said \"The vice-president is an elected official who is restrained by the laws that define his office.\"\r\n\r\nBut, can _you_ cite any law that requires him to release them, or allows us to do it? Unless there is one, he shouldn't be forced to do so.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uuhf","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166602559,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"staunch","parent_id":"t1_cveqo","edited":false,"id":"cvgti","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808999,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40453-5d38ea88-6077-4397-a70b-72862f2e1e41-1566236773"}

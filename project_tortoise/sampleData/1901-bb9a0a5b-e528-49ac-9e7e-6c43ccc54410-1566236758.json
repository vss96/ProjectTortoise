This person is a psychologist?\r\n\r\nNow Jay claims that twins who know they have a twin are more similar than the twins that don't get in studies, adoptive families are too much like original families, adopted twins were sometimes raised in the same home for some amount of time before, and that researchers are biased in favor of genetic conclusions.\r\n\r\nAs for the last one, I'd like to explain away any evidence Jay presents by saying it is biased against genetic conclusions. The second thing, basically you graph effect vs that and there is some effect that decreases with time, and it's all accounted for. The first one, well, this is a pretty weak kind of bias that exists in Every Psychological Study Ever.\r\n\r\nNow he complains that researches are finding differences between reared together and reared apart twins, and that's mistaken because they're.....similar.\r\n\r\nStudies like the kind he insists on at the bottom of 9 have been done, and they agree with other studies.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the author is an ideologue who understands psychology poorly and the journal reviewers are idiots.\r\n\r\nNow, why would you have gotten this paper if you weren't a quality psychologist who knows the literature? Hmmm, could it be cited in one of his popular [books](http://www.amazon.com/Gene-Illusion-Psychiatry-Psychology-Microscope/dp/0875863434)? This Jay Joseph fellow has an axe to grind and it shows.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t48y","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1901-bb9a0a5b-e528-49ac-9e7e-6c43ccc54410-1566236758"}

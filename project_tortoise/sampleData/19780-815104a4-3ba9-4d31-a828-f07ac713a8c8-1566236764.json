These have four main faults: (1) it will produce a crazy electrical problem that will run throughout the vehicle, causing things to break; (2) it will have an antifreeze fault that will end up spraying antifreeze on you through the heater; (3) it will suddenly start to suck up more gas than normal; and (4) the transmission will completely die and have to be replaced.\r\n\r\nBut when it worked, here's what the experience was like. First, it handled awesome around corners. It hugged corners so well that I was going around some at 70mph that I normally wouldn't even think of doing with an SUV. Second, the look of the vehicle was fantastic -- it is very cute. Third, there was plenty of backseat room compared to other SUVs and mini SUVs.\r\n\r\nIf the dang thing would have worked perfectly all the time, I would have kept it up until today.\r\n","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165733642,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cuayz","parent_id":"t1_cuayj","author_flair_text":null,"author":"supermike","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808209,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19780-815104a4-3ba9-4d31-a828-f07ac713a8c8-1566236764"}

The high oil prices of the 70s spurred an amazing leap in exploration, drilling and transportation (pipeline, supertanker, etc.) technologies.  The factor the peak oil apocalyptists forget about is the price of the commodity affects its use:  As oil becomes more scarce, the price will rise and spur the development of effective alternatives.  Oil won't fly to $150 per barrel overnight and by the time it reaches that point it'll no longer be in heavy use (if it's in use at all).\r\n\r\nThe 'easy oil' may be at or past its peak today, but the harder to mine and process materials (like the bitumen deposits in Alberta -- more oil than Saudi Arabia, etc.) are just now being touched.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, just as oil starts running out and the price rises, the amount of available oil in the world increases dramatically yet again.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tyxw","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165513450,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14121-63f34cbd-77ca-4435-9efc-5769a9074b92-1566236762"}

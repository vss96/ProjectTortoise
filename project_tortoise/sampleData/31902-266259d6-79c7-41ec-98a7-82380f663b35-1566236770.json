'Cept the Native Americans.\r\n\r\nThere's no question that, over time, you could compensate for the situation.  But it's not trivial to replace millions of low-cost workers quickly.\r\n\r\n&gt; Produce might go up 10% in cost without illegals.\r\n\r\nDon't forget hotels, cleaning crews, gardening, construction, cooking, labor of all sorts...  And I am pretty sure it's a lot more cost effective than 10%.\r\n\r\nBut it's all beside the point, as there is no practical method to deport millions of people and keep them out.  Republicans talk about getting rid of them to get votes, then turn around and profit on their cheap labor.\r\n\r\nHow could you possibly secure a border that large?  The only way it would work is if the largest industry in the U.S. became the \"get rid of illegals\" agency.  Otherwise you couldn't even keep up with who's already here.\r\n\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31902-266259d6-79c7-41ec-98a7-82380f663b35-1566236770"}

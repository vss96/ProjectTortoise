Most people I know who remembered Traveller and also saw Firefly said \"Hey ... that's Traveller, only in t.v. form!\"  I can see a MMORPG falling along similar lines: trade, piracy, bounty hunting, smuggling, combat. \r\n\r\nYeah, lots of people will just want to be Mal or Zoe, but it's that way with any game, right?  If they pull off the ambience of the Firefly 'verse, maybe pushing a trade angle somehow to motivate moving around between moons/planets, I can see it being a pretty fun place to game.\r\n\r\n\"Go to quadrant 313 and bring back the fingers of 13 reavers for a shiny pair of boots!\"\r\n\r\n:-)","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_u1x9","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165630663,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17667-ae28130f-0f66-466a-a85b-895ab578a480-1566236763"}

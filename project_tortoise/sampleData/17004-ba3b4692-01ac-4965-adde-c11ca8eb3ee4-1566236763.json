In the future we will have much greater access to all of the stuff money can buy. Thus, when deciding whether to spend your chasing money or chasing the intangibles, chase the intangibles, because the money will take care of itself in the future, as long as you have at least a reasonable amount of money.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Maslow's hierarchy is pretty out of date. A  better motivational paradigm would be either Alderfer's ERG theory or Herzberg's two-factor theory.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17004-ba3b4692-01ac-4965-adde-c11ca8eb3ee4-1566236763"}

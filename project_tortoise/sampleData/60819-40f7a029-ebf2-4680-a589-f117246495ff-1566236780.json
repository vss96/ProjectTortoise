The author seems to pick on statically-typed languages in particular, but the problem he describes is just as prevalent in dynamic languages.\r\n\r\nI only half agree with you here. While I agree that it really isn't a polymorphism issue, the promise of statically typed langauges give good reason to pick on them more than other langauges that have the same faults.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wixp","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809759,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"grauenwolf","id":"cwksv","parent_id":"t1_cwk9y","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60819-40f7a029-ebf2-4680-a589-f117246495ff-1566236780"}

{"body":"OK, what about the halflife of the photon?  Do we say \"theory X says a photon has a halflife of several billion years, rather than the conventional viewpoint of infinite, therefore the theories disagree by an infinite quantity and its like saying a human is infinitely tall\"?\r\n\r\nNo, because this whole idea that ratios of measurable quantities from one pair of theories are equivalent in some way to ratios of entirely different measurable quantities from another pair of theories is baloney.\r\n\r\nI have given evidence that the ratio completely breaks down under fairly normal circumstances.  If you can give me some convincing reason as to why this ratio has any significance beyond mere rhetoric, I'll reconsider.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w8sr","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167330450,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"acrophobia","parent_id":"t1_cw9ks","id":"cw9uj","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809554,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55262-a0f82bc6-03a1-4565-bc5d-fd607c5446a0-1566236779"}

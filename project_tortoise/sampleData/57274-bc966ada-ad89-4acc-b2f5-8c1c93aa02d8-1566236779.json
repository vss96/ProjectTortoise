It depends on how you count, I guess, and they're vague to the point of misleading.\r\n\r\nThe actual mountains range is around 1500 miles long and around 150 miles wide on average.  That's ~225000 sq. miles, which is around 0.1% of the (~200M sq. mile) Earth's surface.  If you exclude oceans and only count *land area*, that would bring it up around 0.3%.  (I work on aviation mapping software and I deal with geography and terrain data a lot and have for 10+ years.)\r\n\r\nThey're probably counting the \"watershed area\" of the mountains, which extends as much as thousands of miles around the mountains themselves, all the way to the ocean in most directions.  If you count the watershed instead of the mountains themselves and you count it against land area only, you might get 10%.\r\n","link_id":"t3_w8w9","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167420190,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57274-bc966ada-ad89-4acc-b2f5-8c1c93aa02d8-1566236779"}

I hate going out for a drink with friends, RARELY finding a bar/restaurant with a non-smoking section, and still coming home smelling like cigarettes, even if we did manage to find a place with a so called \"non-smoking\" section - where they seat you 3 tables away from a guy puffing away and call it \"non-smoking.\"\r\n\r\nI hate the fact that there are still smoking cars on trains...seeing as people walk up and down the enclosed train cars all the time and spread the smoke everywhere.  I ended up with a hacking cough for the weekend as a result of a 5 hour train ride in a car NEXT to the smoking car, not even in it.  People can smoke in train stations, airports, bus stops, public malls, restaurants, bars, etc. though luckily they just banned it INSIDE THE CLASSROOMS at my university.\r\n\r\nI could care less if you smoke outside away from windows and doors...if I don't like the smell or the cough or the headache it gives me I'm free to walk away.  If  you want to kill yourself for a tiny little nicotine buzz (yes I tried smoking to see what the deal was...I just don't get it), go ahead, but just don't let it affect me!\r\n\r\nIt's kinda the same way I feel about religion...do whatever the hell you want, as long as it doesn't affect me!","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ubmh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165797641,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21127-f5b0b201-30da-43e3-95b5-dac58e535a99-1566236765"}

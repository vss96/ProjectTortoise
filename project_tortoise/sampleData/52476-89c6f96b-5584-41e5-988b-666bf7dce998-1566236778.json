What's the leap of faith when someone types in \"www.hotmail.com\" as many people do according to one of the linked reports?\r\n\r\n&gt; IE /isn't/ uninstallable, Google is.\r\n\r\nWho cares? You don't have to use IE, and you don't have to use Google. Perhaps you can't physically remove IE from your computer, but what of it? You can't physically remove Google from the Web.\r\n\r\n&gt; Google isn't deliberately trying to hijack other people's trademarks. If you search for \"Flickr\", it doesn't suggest \"Picasa\". That would be a bigger issue.\r\n\r\nI think the folks at Bloglines would beg to differ. Whether it's \"intentional\" hijacking is irrelevant; Google's tip appears on a search for \"bloglines\".\r\n\r\n&gt; The suggestion for \"photo sharing\" are below 2 paid advertisements anyway.\r\n\r\nNot always. Reload the search results a few times and you'll see that sometimes there are no ads at the top, only on the side, putting the tip on top. The article links to a screenshot of one such case.\r\n\r\n&gt; whereas MS posting anything you visit to find recommendations screams EVILLLLL SPYWARE\r\n\r\nMicrosoft doesn't have to post anything to check for \"google.com\" in the client. I don't think Google's address is changing any time soon.\r\n\r\n&gt; If people /are/ using the search bar to find sites, they're probably searching for specific things with specific names. I doubt seeing a Google alternative is really going to sway many people if they get a link for Google's Orkut if they're looking for MySpace.\r\n\r\nRight. And someone navigating to an address intends to go to that address, so maybe an IE tip wouldn't be that effective. That wasn't the question. The question was whether the analogy is valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w3h0","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809453,"author":"LiquidNitro","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cw4ib","parent_id":"t1_cw4hb","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52476-89c6f96b-5584-41e5-988b-666bf7dce998-1566236778"}

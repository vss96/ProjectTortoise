In this way the vocal minority represents the silent majority. I’m not sure if it is laziness, fear or something else but because the silent majority continues to stay silent they must assume responsibility for their inaction and understand that from an outsiders point of view they will continue to be lumped in with their vocal counterparts. \r\n\r\n^ You can generally insert any religion or broad viewpoint here.\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808851,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cv7jw","edited":false,"id":"cv931","author_flair_text":null,"author":"bluffy","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36434-c5717b31-750c-40b1-860b-42557713c386-1566236772"}

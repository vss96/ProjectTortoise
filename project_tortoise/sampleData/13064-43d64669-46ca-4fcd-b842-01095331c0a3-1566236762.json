{"controversiality":0,"body":"Not always - in *equilibrium* this is true, but markets are seldom in equilibrium.  If buyers believe that home prices will drop in the future, yet sellers believe that houses *ought* to sell for much more than the buyers are asking, then the bid/ask spread will keep increasing as inventory builds up.  Eventually the sellers may face facts, realize that they're not going to get a million dollars for a 4-bedroom house that they don't want anymore, and drop their asking price until it sells.  But it's by no means guaranteed that both buyer and seller will behave rationally in the short run.","link_id":"t3_tvcu","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165461583,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctxin","id":"ctxkp","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807958,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13064-43d64669-46ca-4fcd-b842-01095331c0a3-1566236762"}

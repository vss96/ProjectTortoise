{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; The game is, frankly, not very good.\r\n\r\nWell, there's the understatement of the year. It's complete crap, in fact. From concept to implementation to its sinister motives (propaganda).\r\n\r\nI especially enjoyed the [anti-evolution \"informational\" screens](http://media.pc.ign.com/media/757/757683/img_3893709.html) and [other intelligent design drivel](http://www.gamespot.com/pages/image_viewer/frame_lead.php?pid=928956&amp;img=2&amp;sid=undefined). The subtle [\"911\" imagery on top of ambulances](http://media.pc.ign.com/media/757/757683/img_3187458.html) is slick too.\r\n\r\nConsidering the in-game ads in this game, and blatant dobson-style propaganda, it would be very interesting to see where the money came from. Did EBGames, Washington Mutual, US Army and Ad Council really pay to be part of this garbage?\r\n\r\nIt sure smells a whole lot like american family association, family research council and concerned women for america all over.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ulcz","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165963150,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":5,"ups":5,"author":"dln","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cumpc","parent_id":"t1_cum5k","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808431,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25812-0806ca2e-b488-48c8-a4b9-6a9b54f92735-1566236767"}

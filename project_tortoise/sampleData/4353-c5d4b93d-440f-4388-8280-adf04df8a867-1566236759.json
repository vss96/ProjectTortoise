When I compared linguistic/mathematical talent to economic opinions, I was noting that expertise in one field doesn't always apply to another, and that Chomsky or Einstein's beliefs should be judged on their merits, not on who espoused them.\r\n\r\nWhat should I be measuring or am I mismeasuring about Gates' and Buffett's charitable giving? They're redistributing money from American software consumers and investors (among others) to starving children in Africa. On a utilitarian basis, that's a pretty good trade. The fact that such a trade can be made without sacrificing lots of future productivity by eroding property rights is a huge bonus.\r\n\r\nCan you link to any particular Einstein essay on his political beliefs? I'd be interested in what you mean by this. As for Gates Sr. and Buffett, it's certainly great to speak out against corporatism and regressive taxes -- but mostly because such policies are counterproductive, not because they happen to make the rich better off. Free speech makes the rich better off, too -- it's no worse for it.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_tcs0","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4353-c5d4b93d-440f-4388-8280-adf04df8a867-1566236759"}

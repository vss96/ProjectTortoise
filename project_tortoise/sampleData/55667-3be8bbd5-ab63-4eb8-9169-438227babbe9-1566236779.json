The Big Replacement has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Based on newer technology than the old code. (In my company's case it was on Windows instead of Solaris and it used COM.)\r\n2. It won't have any of the flaws that the old codebase has since the company has knowledge to avoid making them again. (I'm laughing as I type this.)\r\n3. It will provide superior features and enhancements over the old codebase, and our customers will love the company.\r\n\r\nThe Big Replacement is basically the Big Rewrite with better marketing.\r\n\r\nDON'T BE FOOLED!\r\n\r\nThe same corporate culture that produced the old ugly codebase will also produce The Big Replacement. Even if it starts out neat and clean The Big Replacement will evolve into the same mess that old codebase was.","created_utc":1167344089,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":8,"ups":8,"subreddit":"programming","parent_id":"t3_w995","edited":false,"id":"cwaog","author_flair_text":null,"author":"MelechRic","retrieved_on":1473809569,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55667-3be8bbd5-ab63-4eb8-9169-438227babbe9-1566236779"}

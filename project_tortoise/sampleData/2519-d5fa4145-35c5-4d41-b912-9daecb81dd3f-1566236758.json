(Probably not the first auction company/companies you think of, either. :P) So far, I've been learning and improving my Java, Perl, shell scripting, and a bit of C here. And I've been having fun.\r\n\r\nNo internships on my resume. Gained a lot of my Java knowledge from working for another company earlier this year... They did service catalogs. I barely understand what their software does, even to this day. Oh well.\r\n\r\nDid a bit of work for a stealthed startup - PHP + mySQL stuff, system administration, and AJAX-ish side projects.\r\n\r\nIn school, the last language I learned before graduating was Lisp for my compilers class. That was fun. I learned a few other languages in school too.\r\n\r\nI think I still like C. But more than that, I enjoy coding and learning (new languages and stuff in computer science). One day I'd like to do stuff with computer security. No idea what, yet.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t9kv","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807531,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctaro","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct9lw","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2519-d5fa4145-35c5-4d41-b912-9daecb81dd3f-1566236758"}

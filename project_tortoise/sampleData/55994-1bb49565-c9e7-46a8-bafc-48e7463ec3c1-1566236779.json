Sounds like it was packed DURING the duration of the whole debacle.\r\n\r\nAlso, once they decided to honor the lower price, they were agreeing that *that was the price of the computer*.  It was a manager's call.  If I announce at a BMW dealership that all new BMWs are now $1, they'd be stupid to sell it for that amount, and stupider yet for selling it and then thinking they have a claim against me.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it being private property, they are allowed to show anything legal that they want.  It's quite obvious from the audio alone without even having to look at it when porn's being played.  If you glance at it even for a second, you'll know, too.  I don't think anyone is damaged by seeing porn for a second, and if they stood there, watching, then it was *their own choice*.  Whatever expectations you may have (PG store), once you see that those aren't being met (porn), it's your own fault if you don't get your kids away from it.\r\n\r\nWhat they could really get him with is trespassing, if it was closed to the public when he went in.  However, since he had the keys (they hadn't asked for them back), hadn't been replaced yet, and was *still being paid*, it's arguable that he was officially STILL officially an employee at the time!\r\n\r\nIt would cost them more money to sue him, and they'd have to dredge up the tapes from years ago, which probably don't exist.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1167355194,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55994-1bb49565-c9e7-46a8-bafc-48e7463ec3c1-1566236779"}

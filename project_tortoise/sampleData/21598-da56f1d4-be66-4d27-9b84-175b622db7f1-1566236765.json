The libertarians cook the books to make Pinochet's economic policies look look a lot more effective than they actually were.\r\n\r\n&gt;His bumped off socialist organisers as he was consolidating power and the relatives and idealogical supporters of these people are understandably upset about it.\r\n\r\nIt's not just socialists who are against murdering political prisoners.  Pinochet's [Caravan of Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravan_of_Death) should be regarded as evil even by capitalists.  Pinochet deposed a democratically elected leader in a military coup, he sent out death squads to murder those who disagreed with him politically, he was responsible for the killing of an American journalist (Charles Horman), his regime burned political protesters alive, and Pinochet was also accused of being a drug smuggler by those who worked with him.  One doesn't need to be a socialist to regard Pinochet as a vile leader.  Leaders should be judged by how they act, not whether they are on your ideological team.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808272,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cudas","edited":false,"id":"cueae","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21598-da56f1d4-be66-4d27-9b84-175b622db7f1-1566236765"}

What kind of argumentation is that?  I'm asking you to take the \"possible\" and \"desirable\" thing as a given, for a hypothetical web application.  You can't just nullify givens like that.\r\n\r\nI agree that it might be a bad idea for _webmail_, but is it really that hard to imagine an application where it's _not_ a bad idea?\r\n\r\nUpon reflection, I probably should have said \"fully compatible\" instead of simply \"compatible\".  We can both agree that there are situations where your methodology works very well.  I'm just saying that there are plenty of situations where it doesn't, and in those situations, your methodology either becomes restricitive, or moves you toward the two versions scenario.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165333639,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","id":"ctpe9","parent_id":"t1_ctp9j","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"bhagany","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807806,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"9074-866acb3f-cabc-4689-a14c-938e3e28a783-1566236760"}

It is, somehow, more irritating for me to hear it espoused by highly educated women than by other women because I used to believe they were clear eyed critical thinkers, my own sentimental and elitist stereotype.  Some of these women, who would never tolerate stereotyping of black people as stupid, lazy, violent and worthless, tar all men with that brush.  The basis of the friendships of so many of these women is their professed contempt for men, their cynicism about marriage.  This relentless cynicism may be the result of disappointment and fear, but it is a destructive, divisive force.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808042,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u1zo","id":"cu21c","author":"thevalarauk","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14973-f41d549b-51cd-4be0-ad4f-adfd2199cebc-1566236762"}

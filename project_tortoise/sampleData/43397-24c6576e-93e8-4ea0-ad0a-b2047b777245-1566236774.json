{"body":"ok so i'm not really one for posting blogs but this definately seemed like an appropriate occasion:\r\n\r\nThe greatest spin bowler of all time, a Wisden cricketer of the CENTURY, the man who has single handedly won more test matches than any player previously and possibly to come, Shane Warne has retired. \r\n\r\nFor someone who pretty much doesnt remember cricket before Shane Warne, this is a sad day. I remember watching the 'ball that shocked the world' that ripped back at right angles behind Gatting's legs and smashed the wickets into pieces.\r\n\r\nI could sit for hours and watche Warnie bowl. Even if he didnt take a wicket in those hours it was simply magical to watch. I think it says something about a man when generations of backyard cricketers shout out \"Bowling Warnie!' every time someone bowls a nice delivery.\r\n\r\nPossibly one of the best and most accurate things i've seen written about him since he announced his retirement is this:\r\n\r\n\"A legspinner is a gambler and a charlatan by trade. He tosses the ball up and invites the batsman to go after him. He uses three-card tricks, thimbles, smoke, mirrors and good old fashioned bullshit to pull off the confidence trick that is his every wicket. On the street it is arrogance, on the field it is art\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShane Warne turly was an artist, but his art cannot be sold to the highest bidder. It is free for future generations to behold but never repeat.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vn18","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166717911,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"JesterFace","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_vn18","id":"cvn1d","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809120,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43397-24c6576e-93e8-4ea0-ad0a-b2047b777245-1566236774"}

That link was interesting, but I don't think it applies to this city, where people pay $10-$25/hour or $175-$350/month to park. Private parking spaces routinely sell for $40K to $150K.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w798","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167278833,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":3,"score":3,"author":"pivo","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw7q9","id":"cw7si","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809516,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54311-2b899eb2-8a5a-474c-bf3b-ed5d3b7e1a65-1566236779"}

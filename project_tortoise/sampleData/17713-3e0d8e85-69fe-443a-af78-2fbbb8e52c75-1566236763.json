I don't see a good reason for people not to convert to a Mac if they are disatisfied with Vista. \r\n\r\nI think that people upgrade OS's when they upgrade computers. So most people who might get Vista are people are buying a new computer. However, given the choice between a new computer with OSX and a new computer with Vista, I think a lot of people are going to switch to OSX.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808139,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cu75l","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u71w","author_flair_text":null,"author":"misterwilliam","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17713-3e0d8e85-69fe-443a-af78-2fbbb8e52c75-1566236763"}

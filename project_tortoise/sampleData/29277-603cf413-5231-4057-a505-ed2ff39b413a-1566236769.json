The criticism can apply to any big library.  You have STL memorized, do you?  How about .NET?  How do you format your double into a C++ string (not a C char[])?\r\n\r\nOn the specifics, you open a file like this:\r\n\r\n        PrintStream out = new PrintStream(\"filename\");\r\n\r\nAnd send a formatted double to it like this:\r\n\r\n        out.printf(\"%0.3f\", mydouble);\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scripting stuff is a uniform framework for adding extension languages to Java programs, like adding TCL to C programs, or embedding Perl.  What's wrong with that?\r\n","link_id":"t3_utqb","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29277-603cf413-5231-4057-a505-ed2ff39b413a-1566236769"}

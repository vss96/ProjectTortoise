{"body":"Yeah. I was echoing the title for effect. Probably the most precise formulation would be \"...makes you less socialist\". The whole of socialism basically rests of the labor theory of value, which is obvious nonsense in its naive formulation (\"go dig a hole, how is that valuable\"), and a circularity in its fancy form (\"value is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor. labor is socially necessary if it creates things of value\"). That's how they can believe profit is \"the rich robbing the working class\" (because they think value is a fixed size pie after items are made). The whole concept is a tangle of utterly willful illogic, but when you cut away the nonsense, all the \"social justice\" slogans crumble to dust and blow away. How can you think profit is unfair, once you realize that it reflects the extent a profiteer has quite literally made the world a better place?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vcvm","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":7,"score":7,"created_utc":1166564107,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"JulianMorrison","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvewl","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvelh","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808962,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39376-15c1e621-86f9-4fc5-ab38-c45d02921693-1566236773"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"\"I just hope that no one gets the idea from the cancellation of the space shuttle that reusable vehicles are automatically not viable.\"\r\n\r\nThe shuttle isn't reusable.  It takes many months of work to pretty much remanufacture the heat shield and engines, the fuel tank is thrown away, and the SRBs might as well be.  Calling the shuttle reusable is not far from calling Apollo/SaturnV reusable because they could have overhauled the Apollo command module and flown it again.\r\n\r\nWe simply don't have any need for something with the payload of the shuttle and reusable.  A fully reusable rocket with a 1 tonne payload to low orbit, but that could fly every day, would be far more useful.\r\n\r\nSpaceShipOne, btw, can lift about 200 kg out of the atmosphere (plus the pilot).  That 200 kg could be 180 kg of rocket motor plus a 20 kg satellite.  SpaceShipTwo is a lot bigger, can lift (and therefore launch) a lot more, and will eb much more reusable than SpaceShipOne.  And other people are working on other similar things, none of which will fly into orbit themselves, but than can be cheaply used to launch things that *do*.\r\n","link_id":"t3_ujzj","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165976726,"score":4,"ups":4,"author":"brucehoult","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cul9m","id":"cunhg","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808446,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26220-18a3f1f0-0773-4a02-92a2-eec8585cc689-1566236767"}

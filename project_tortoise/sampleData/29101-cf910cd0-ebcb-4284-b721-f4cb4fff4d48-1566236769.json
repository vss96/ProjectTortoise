(Wii Sports in particular).  Nintendo got one thing right in particular like they always do - It's the games that make the system, not the specs.  The PS3 launched with enormous fanfare and tons of buzz, however, with the exception of Resistance, the launch lineup has been more than underwelming.  360 has a few great games and shares almost the entire library from 3rd party developers with the PS3.  I think that fact and it's availabilty have shown based on it's fantastic sales over the last few months.  We'll see how this whole thing plays out in the next few months, but it's typically the system with the best exclusive titles that wins.  If Red Steel had been the best game on the Wii, I think we'd be looking at a very different situation here.","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1166135995,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cutri","parent_id":"t3_usfq","author":"clinintern","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808562,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29101-cf910cd0-ebcb-4284-b721-f4cb4fff4d48-1566236769"}

I hit upon the idea after seeing Hezbollah start dishing out cash to Lebanese after the cease-fire with Israel was enacted.  Cash is a great motivator and it certainly helped Hezbollah improve its local image after the conflict, particularly when the govt. was slow to act (if at all) upon the reconstruction effort.\r\n\r\nThe ISG report makes a similar proposal:\r\n\r\n&gt;There are proposals to redistribute a portion of oil revenues directly to the population on a per capita basis.  These proposals have the potential to give all Iraqi citizens a stake in the nation's chief natural resource, but it would take time to develop a fair distribution system.  Oil revenues have been incorporated into state budget projections for the next several years.  There is no institution in Iraq as present that could properly implement such a distribution system.  It would take substantial time to establish, and would have to be based on a well-developed state census and income tax system, which Iraq currently lacks.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165589740,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16021-e02a98e0-376a-485e-9965-13bd2a7a9722-1566236763"}

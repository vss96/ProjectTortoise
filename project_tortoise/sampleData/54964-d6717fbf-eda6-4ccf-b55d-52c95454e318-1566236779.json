Especially in areas of cosmology, there are frequently multiple-orders-of-magnitude corrections in measurements, especially with regards to the size, volume, and mass.  The \"scientific establishment\" didn't try to defend themselves as saying \"they think we're off by a factor of 100???  That's like saying we think men are 600 feet tall!!!\"\r\n \r\n&gt; It is as though McIntosh estimated the height of a man as 6 feet and then accused the rest of us of believing that the same man was 460,000 times as tall, or 521 miles.","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473809543,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_w8sr","id":"cw988","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"danweber","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54964-d6717fbf-eda6-4ccf-b55d-52c95454e318-1566236779"}

They're not being dishonest, they're just using a word in a way that you quibble with.  As I said, everyone who is interested in understanding knows what they mean.\r\n\r\nIf I said that electricty \"chooses\" to take the path of least resistance, would you call that dishonest?  No, it's a useful metaphor for understanding.  Yes, it *always* makes that choice (just as evolution always chooses the fittest genes), but so what?  It's a mechanism for explanation.  I'm sorry you don't like that word, but it's not dishonest to use metaphors.","retrieved_on":1473809323,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvxn8","parent_id":"t1_cvxmi","author_flair_text":null,"author":"DavidSJ","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48832-07d0201e-01ac-479b-9688-46100d3fd145-1566236777"}

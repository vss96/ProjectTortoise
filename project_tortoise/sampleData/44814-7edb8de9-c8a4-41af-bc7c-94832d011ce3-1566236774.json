If you're going to do that, though, make damned sure you check your background and have rounds that are unlikely to travel, like hollowpoints.  In the Army, they just taught me to aim center mass (which is good advice if you're firing with a rifle from cover, but not ideal when confronted at close range with a handgun in your mitts unless it's something like a .45).\r\n\r\nWhat I find most odd about this is that it's neither a traditional headshot nor a vital organs shot.  All things considered, though, having half your face destroyed is sure to slow you down, so I guess it makes sense.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vjjh","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44814-7edb8de9-c8a4-41af-bc7c-94832d011ce3-1566236774"}

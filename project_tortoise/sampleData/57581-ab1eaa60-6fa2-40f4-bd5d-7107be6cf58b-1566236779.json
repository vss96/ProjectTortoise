{"controversiality":0,"body":"I'm a leader of a local middle school after school group and have chaperoned middle school dances.  Its just as bad if not worse than what one would see at a club on a Friday night.  I don't do them anymore because I spend the whole time keeping boys and girls off each other.\r\n\r\nI also use to substitute teach and a big problem at some of the schools was that fellatio had become a spectator sport in the bathrooms.  Also Rainbow Parties had and are still a big problem in schools around here... middle schools that is. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_party_(sexuality)\r\n\r\nI remember in Middle School when paddling was still allowed and tank tops where a no no.\r\n\r\nBy the way I live in Bible belt of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wdrb","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":19,"score":19,"created_utc":1167428414,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"bigbeefe","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_wdrb","id":"cweeb","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809639,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"57581-ab1eaa60-6fa2-40f4-bd5d-7107be6cf58b-1566236779"}

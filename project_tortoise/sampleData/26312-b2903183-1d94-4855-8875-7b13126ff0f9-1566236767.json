Nonetheless, when a journalist misuses a phrase like this, it shows their ignorance more than anything else.  Of course language changes; the area of language is very nebolous, and you cannot point precisely at when something becomes accepted or not, and various people will entertain varying opinions on the matter.  That said, the phrase has a specific meaning which the user of the phrase did not intend; for a casual conversation this is fine, for journalism it makes the publication look unprofessional.  So I stand by by 'Damn shoddy journalism' comment.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26312-b2903183-1d94-4855-8875-7b13126ff0f9-1566236767"}

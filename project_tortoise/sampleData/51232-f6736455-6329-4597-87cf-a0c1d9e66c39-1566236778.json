Subjects were asked to give the readings for 20 comparatively uncommon kanji and kanji compounds and to explain the meaning of two sentences in the text, one considered easier than the other.\" He gives this summary of the results: [removed picture]\r\n&gt;*The results of the 1945-6 and 1948 surveys doubtless were affected by the war's interruption of education* -- but the 1955-6 survey did not show a very different picture. I haven't been able to find any reference to comparable surveys done since 1955-6. It seems hard to believe that no such surveys exist -- if you know of any, please tell me -- but the situation should perhaps be interpreted in the light of this comment by Unger [...]\r\n\r\nWait a sec, he's saying that the halting of education during the war (1939-1945ish?) affected 1,452 male and female workers in fourteen factories on a survey that was taken as early as 1945-1946? I'm not quite sure that this could be true. Wouldn't it affect the results for surveys taken a few years later, when the kids that were raised during the war period are older? (then again, maybe a huge amount of kids from that era ended up working in factories early on, but to the point of skewing survey results?)\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_vzzg","stickied":false,"subreddit":"science","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167147766,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51232-f6736455-6329-4597-87cf-a0c1d9e66c39-1566236778"}

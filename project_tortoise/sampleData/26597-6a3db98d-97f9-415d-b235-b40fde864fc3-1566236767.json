They showed some suprising results about what alcohol actually did - namely very little.\r\n\r\nBut the other components? Sure, they deserve study, but let's do it in ways that don't perserve all the myths about various drinks. When studying drugs, you first isolate the active components that you want to study. If not, the results will be mucked up by all the stupid voodoo mystical superstitions people have about port, tequila, vodka, absinthe or whatever.","link_id":"t3_ulur","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165995849,"ups":1,"score":1,"author":"vintermann","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuobw","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cunjx","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808462,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26597-6a3db98d-97f9-415d-b235-b40fde864fc3-1566236767"}

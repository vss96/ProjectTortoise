I can see clear flaws in the law, but it does have a bit of merit (though I wish that the 'no means no' ruling would have been enough).\r\n\r\nStill I can see your side of the issue, the absolution of responsibility because of drunkenness has a few clear flaws. For example, getting themselves utterly trashed is a technique people often use to excuse promiscuous sex and trying to work a legal ruling into this will throw off the courtship rituals for a reasonably large segment of the population.\r\n\r\nThe trick is to find a balance where you can protect the people who had a nice glass of wine or two with that dinner and a movie from being slapped with rape charges and protect the people who drank themselves into insensible babbling from their inability to coherently communicate ‘Not tonight honey, I forgot my pill!’ or ‘I’m not gay!’ to the would be partener.","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_wa4w","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56104-529d5761-9f8b-442f-a21a-5de46a22948c-1566236779"}

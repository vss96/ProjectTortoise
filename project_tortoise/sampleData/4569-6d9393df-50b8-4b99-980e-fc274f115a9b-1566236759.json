The other two I tend to believe are heavily processed, especially Britney.\r\n\r\nAnd things like Antares Auto-Tune have been around for quite a while, you'd be surprised how much it's used.  Minor corrections even used to be performed on tape, speeding up and slowing down flat and sharp notes.  This remains the reason why I'd much rather see someone in an intimate live setting, without all the production.  The real talent shows through all the studio bullshit.\r\n\r\nBut, remember, there are a lot of pretty girls out there with talent.  This is simply a case of bad talent evaluation if they picked a girl who simply cannot sing based on her looks.  Hell, she's not even that pretty (compared to most models).  And she'll have to eventually perform in a situation where studio effects and \"helper tracks\" can't save her (Ashley Simpson anyone?).","controversiality":1,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tenx","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807615,"distinguished":null,"author":"frickindeal","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctf70","parent_id":"t1_ctey6","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4569-6d9393df-50b8-4b99-980e-fc274f115a9b-1566236759"}

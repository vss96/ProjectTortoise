Other than that, they're still practicing their old policies of having almost all part-timers, capping wages, and telling employees that emergency time off for a sick kid is an unexcused absence.\r\n\r\nThis article, again, reminds me why I quit having anything to do with their company four years ago.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165226593,"ups":2,"score":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tiui","id":"ctj8x","author_flair_text":null,"author":"berberine","retrieved_on":1473807691,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6277-1a4a46db-1f3a-483a-af33-bc532be28101-1566236760"}

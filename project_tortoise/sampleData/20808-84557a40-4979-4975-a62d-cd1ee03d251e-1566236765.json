I suspect that the world is not only more fucked up than we suppose, but more fucked up than we *can* suppose. But since there is little or no social stigma on being a Christian and atheists tend to at least pay heavy lip-service to religious tolerance, I would think that it would be a lot less common than it is from Christian parents.\r\n\r\n&gt; not to mention by casting all Christians in bad light as many atheists do, do you really think that the kids are honestly saying to themselves \"Hmm if I become a Christian mom and dad will be proud of me!\"\r\n\r\nA question, not an attack: what exactly do you mean by \"casting all Christians in bad light\"? Is this done by casting aspersions on Christians' *characters* or their *average intelligence*? I ask because it's an important distinction to make; religious affiliation doesn't seem to have much effect on morality except for fundamentalist nutcases, but it *is* fairly common for atheists to either state or imply that religious people are, on average, less intelligent than atheists.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808247,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cucvs","edited":false,"id":"cucy6","author_flair_text":null,"author":"sketerpot","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20808-84557a40-4979-4975-a62d-cd1ee03d251e-1566236765"}

Option Explicit would require variables to be declared, but you didn't have to specify their types. Option Compare altered the was string comparisions were done, and Option Base let you choose 0 or 1 based array indexes.\r\n\r\nOption Strict was introduced in VB7, a.k.a VB.Net. With it you were required to also give a type to all variables. This was also when they removed Option Base.\r\n\r\nWith VB9, you also get Option Infer. This allows you to turn on type inferance so you get static type checking without specifying the type.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vr55","subreddit":"programming","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1166816341,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46000-ef0d2d8e-5aa4-4de0-b33e-be099de6070d-1566236775"}

{"body":"The physical theory of quantum mechanics or quantum field theory does not require indulging in the quasi-philosophical issues you mention. It is eminently useful and accurate over an enormous domain of technological importance, and seems to only have serious difficulty describing what happens in the vicinity of black holes or what happened in the first microsecond or so of the history of the universe. That it does not offer a compelling answer to \"how many angels can dance on the head of pin\" or other similar questions does not reduce its value.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a candidate theory that solves those issues, and still accurately describes the physics of the semiconductor laser that is in every CD-ROM player, then you will have a reason to complain.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vk0o","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":9,"ups":9,"created_utc":1166723431,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"sickofthisshit","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cvnbo","id":"cvnic","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809130,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43679-554ca9b1-f0f4-4988-8d39-c8e38c2de825-1566236774"}

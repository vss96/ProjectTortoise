{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; his poverty of understanding of philosophy and theology shines through, as many reviewers have pointed out\r\n\r\nand yet curiously, none of the reviewers I've seen have pointed out *where* the flaw in his reasoning lies. The usual tactic is (qv Eagleton) to invoke a number of august names or obscure theologies to prove the reviewer's erudition, and then weigh in with some heavy-duty sneering.\r\n\r\nwrt Russell vs Dawkins. Dawkins' great talent is as explicator, not as ground-breaker - they differ here - and as a demagogue of the bourgeoisie - where they're very similar. His main intellectual contribution is the application of arguments from natural selection. He deploys some of Russell's arguments to powerful effect. In fact, many of the anti-religious arguments he makes aren't new, and I think it's the manifest failure of theologians and religious apologists to answer some of these really basic points except by throwing up a squid-ink-like cloud of obscurity that largely accounts for his notorious tetchiness.\r\n\r\nI do agree that Dennett has a much more searching intellect, and offers more nuanced answers to practical questions about the danger of religion. However, if by 'easy answers to hard questions' you mean questions about the supernatural, rather than questions about religion - belief in God rather than belief in belief - then I should point out that Dennett and Dawkins give almost identical answers to those questions (and are equally scornful about some of the dafter 'proofs' of God's existence). But to reiterate: these arguments don't need to be novel or complicated in order to be correct. The argument about the supernatural mind-reading God which, whatever Eagleton and his ilk may claim, is what *most* supers believe in, is not a complicated or difficult one.\r\n\r\nI do also agree that I'd like to see him argue with as many theologians of as heavy a calibre as possible. Unfortunately, as I pointed out originally, as far as I know the tendency has been for them to reject him. You dismiss Sentamu, but I believe the other Archbish and Jonathan Sacks are both well-respected.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tivn","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165399000,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"lessofthat","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cttd6","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctqov","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807881,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"11148-cd0d30c1-c586-4325-919a-59fe1eea451a-1566236761"}

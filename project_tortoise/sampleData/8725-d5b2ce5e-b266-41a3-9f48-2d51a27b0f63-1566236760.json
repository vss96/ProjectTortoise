The rest were invented later and some of them are deliberately comical. For example, the degrees you take when you become a \"Tall Cedar\" are pretty funny and make comic references to the other degrees.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I've been through all the Scottish Rite stuff (you have to, to become a Shriner) and a Shriner and a Tall Cedar. I've held offices in the Cedars for years; If there are degrees I haven't had, I don't know what they are.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about the various degrees at Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry\r\n\r\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_rite\r\n\r\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_Rite\r\n\r\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriners\r\n\r\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_Cedars_of_Lebanon","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165319715,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8725-d5b2ce5e-b266-41a3-9f48-2d51a27b0f63-1566236760"}

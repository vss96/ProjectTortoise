And it didn't mention anywhere near the issue of green/environment. \r\n\r\nAnd weeks before that the disposed computers and monitors - somewhere in China is creating very serious toxic waste dump - this news was on BBC.\r\n\r\nAnd here I am, sitting in uninsulated house, my landlord is a phd holder of molecular biology from ivy league - but he is unwilling to fix anything about the house. \r\n\r\nOutside temp is 20F. And walls are not even drywalls. It's plywoods, without any insulation. And he's got mortgage on this one for next 30 years. House is originally built in 60s. \r\n\r\nAnd I - sitting in the corner of that house - got very fast G5 and Thinkpad and - and more other computers and stuff - and  very fast net connection. (It's all powered by coal, I believe from West Virginia.)\r\n\r\nIt's really really something makes my mind still and quiet.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808147,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cu7lp","parent_id":"t3_u7l6","edited":false,"author":"7wheels","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17992-b00e6042-4c5d-490c-bb01-488e75a4a969-1566236763"}

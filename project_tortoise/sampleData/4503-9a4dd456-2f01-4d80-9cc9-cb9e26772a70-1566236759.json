No dealing with P2P clients and mall-ware garbage, nor bit torrents. What you get is consistent quality MP3 music files at much lower than market costs with no DRM. You’d think the RIAA would take AllOfMP3’s success as evidence that people are willing to pay for music, lots and lots of music at reasonable prices without DRM. All the recording industry has to do is lower the price and people will buy it online. They could kill AllOfMP3.com by giving customers a better deal. But, why try to compete in the arena of market economics when you can use the US Government to do your dirty work.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tcoa","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807613,"distinguished":null,"author":"socalpundit","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctf2t","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_tcoa","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4503-9a4dd456-2f01-4d80-9cc9-cb9e26772a70-1566236759"}

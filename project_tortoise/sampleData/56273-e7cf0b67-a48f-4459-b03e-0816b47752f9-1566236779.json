However, being unenlightened, they can't comprehend that possibility.  They think their approval is important and since they want it, everyone must want it.  The posturing is primitive pack mentality. \r\n\r\nHowever, there may well be cases where you meet someone who you actually DO care about, who is from that kind of background.  Actually a lot of women are like that -- they will attempt to abuse you and if you let them get away with it, they won't interpret it as, \"wow, this person is really understanding of my psychological issues,\" but \"this person is weak and I don't respect weakness\".\r\n\r\nOr you might meet someone and not let her get away with any \"shit\" so she doesn't get any bad ideas, only to find out she is much more laid back and now thinks you're too uptight!\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to change yourself to fit in with other people then there will likely always be issues.  So just do what you think is right, and if everyone else is wack, fuck 'em -- there will always be prostitutes and cheap heroin.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56273-e7cf0b67-a48f-4459-b03e-0816b47752f9-1566236779"}

To use it we have to figure that certain programming languages are \"blub\".  OK, fine.  Lets say Lisp and Haskel are \"blub\".  What do you mean they can't be blub?  They are superior?  Hold on, we will get to this later.  So this means that all blub programmers know all blub languages?  No.  Does this mean that all blub languages are equal?  No.  How do we do what Paul was saying, and pick the languages superior to blub?  WE CANT.  Because as soon as we do we become blub programmers programming in blub:\r\n\r\n&gt;But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up.\r\n\r\n...thus the paradox!  The best language in the world will have to cover [the three features](http://factor-language.blogspot.com/2006/11/programming-languages.html).  No language fits all three as \"superior\" when compared to another.  Thus all languages are blub!","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809061,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvjz2","parent_id":"t1_cvjw6","author":"sbrown123","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42004-62e2513b-9b29-452f-b79e-434462da3cfa-1566236774"}

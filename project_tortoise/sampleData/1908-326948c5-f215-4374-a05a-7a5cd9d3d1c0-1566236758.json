{"body":"\"I am appalled by your conduct and the manner in which you have driven in the short time you've had a license,\" Klaus told Stark, who had three prior convictions since May 2005 one for disregarding a traffic light and two for speeding. The last speeding conviction came about five weeks before she hit Mr. Wilhelm.\r\n\r\nAll this and she still gets to keep her license?  Where I live, if you include hitting the cyclist, that would be 12 points and she'd lose the license for a minimum of a year.  It also appears that no one did their homework before attempting to prosecute this woman.  Bikers and joggers were common in this area.\r\n\r\nAt least here in NY it's illegal to drive while talking on a cell phone, though I still see people do it.  I don't know if it's made anyone safer though as the police aren't ever around to enforce this law.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t8ou","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165001754,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"berberine","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ct9nq","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_t8ou","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807510,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1908-326948c5-f215-4374-a05a-7a5cd9d3d1c0-1566236758"}

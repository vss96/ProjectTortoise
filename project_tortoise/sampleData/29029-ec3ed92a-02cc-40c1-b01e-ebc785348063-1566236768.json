{"body":"The short explanation is that it's a base-3 system with three symbols, 0, 1, -1. I'll write L for -1; I don't remember what Knuth uses. For example L01 is -1 * 9 + 0 * 3 + 1 * 1 == -8.\r\n\r\nThe first few positive numbers are 1, 1L, 10, 11, 1LL, 1L0. It's an interesting exercise to figure out general rules for addition and multiplication.\r\n\r\nNote that you negate a number by flipping all 1s to Ls and vice versa. So -L01 == 10L. The sign of a number is equal to its most significant non-zero digit.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uqx6","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166133873,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":7,"ups":7,"author":"xenon","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cus3a","id":"cutls","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808559,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"29029-ec3ed92a-02cc-40c1-b01e-ebc785348063-1566236768"}

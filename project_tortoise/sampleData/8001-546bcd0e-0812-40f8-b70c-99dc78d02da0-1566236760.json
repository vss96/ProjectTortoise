{"body":"Is Chavez a demagogue, a hustler, a megalomaniac? Well, of course he is - he is a politician, after all. :) But you raise an excellent point: there's a palpable sense that people in the third world are being uppity if they expect the baseline of popular government intervention that people in rich liberal democracies take for granted. \r\n\r\nA lot of the Chavez hate-on seems to consist of, \"Who the hell does he think he is, anyway?\" How dare he call Bush an imperialist? How dare he capture oil profits to invest in public education and health care (as if neoliberal Alberta doesn't do the same thing in its own way)? How dare he make deals with countries the US doesn't like? Doesn't he know Venezuela is part of the American empire? \r\n\r\nI live in Canada, another part of the American empire that occasionally gets uppity enough to disagree with the hegemon (e.g. over joining the Iraq clusterfuck), and I'm aware of the sheer volume and intensity of imperial vitriol hurled our way every time Canada clears its throat. \r\n\r\nI also know how appallingly craven and self-hating a colony's elites can be when they smell the chance to curry favour with the imperial heartland. There's a rich literature in Canada on our perpetual status as an obsequious client for Britain and then the US.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tic8","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1165281763,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctj85","id":"ctmwr","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807759,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8001-546bcd0e-0812-40f8-b70c-99dc78d02da0-1566236760"}

Problem is the load times: JNLP is even worse than applets, and customers stay away from appletized webpages too.  People even avoid *Flash*, if they can help it.  I don't know how well ClickOnce solves this problem: I couldn't find a trial on the NYTimes without having to download something.\r\n\r\nI suspect that thick client is dead for all apps that can be done with faster load times and performance in AJAX.  People only put up with Flash because doing silly animations with DHTML would mean loading lots of images.  It's the waiting time that customers really care about: the technology doesn't matter, but they don't want to sit and twiddle their thumbs, particularly if they haven't even seen the app yet.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807585,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctdlq","id":"ctdn6","edited":false,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3864-8bfb1bdd-59d9-4b50-81f1-4bd26c13c507-1566236759"}

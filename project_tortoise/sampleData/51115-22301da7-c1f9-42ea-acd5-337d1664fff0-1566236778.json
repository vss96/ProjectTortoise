{"body":"When I was living in my apartment a few years ago, I had the requisite \"beeramid\" (cans stacked against the wall) and for a time there were also 18-pack and 30-pack cases stacked up against the walls. \r\n\r\nI saved the cardboard to take to a recycling facility, I'd drive it over there a couple of times a year since the return on cardboard isn't worth the gas money to make more frequent trips. At some point I had the bright idea to store them open instead of collapsed, to see how much room they'd take up. Somewhere close to 100 cartons filled two walls from floor to ceiling, but it was an eyesore (not to mention a fire hazard), so they got recycled and I never repeated the experiment.\r\n\r\nNever had anywhere *near* that many cans, though. That's just insane... Though I probably drank a fairly similar portion over those 5 years :)","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w04w","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1167142468,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"shaunc","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_w04w","edited":false,"id":"cw232","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809406,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"51115-22301da7-c1f9-42ea-acd5-337d1664fff0-1566236778"}

The compiler cannot (should not) infer memoization, since it is not always optimal. In fact, it is not optimal in this case either - it would use more space (I am intentionally ignoring the computational benefit, like some would typically ignore the space cost - cognotive dissonance anyone?).\r\n\r\nHowever, memoization would prevent the exponential time of the algorithm. It is a trade-off between \"space\" and \"computation\". It is entirely coincidental that most people would agree that the trade-off in favour of computation at the expense of space is preferred - but the compiler is not free to make this decision. If it were, we'd be using those eagerly evaluated, imperative languages all over again.\r\n\r\nHeck, while yer there, evaluate the entire universe so that we never have to compute anything ever again - we will just look it up in the universal hash table.","link_id":"t3_uqo3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808588,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cusm0","id":"cuv66","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29844-dfcd689b-9b0c-4772-bca1-b225b68e4819-1566236769"}

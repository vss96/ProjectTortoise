This is much more powerful than eval() in python. Although eval(string) implements the string =&gt; code isomorphism, the problem is that it is very difficult to introspect the actual syntax/parse-tree of the code, when it is represented as a string. However, if code is forced into the form of an S-expression (essentially a list), it is trivial to run through the parse-tree of the code by looking at each item in the list.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w6m0","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809562,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"bosco","id":"cwa9q","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw6m1","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55463-c2da3f27-1d0f-46a9-96de-738346e374c8-1566236779"}

My view is that they are just panning for gold sleazily, hoping for your weak examiner scenario. \r\n\r\nBTW exposing an object interface to a programming language for the service, a standard Microsoft practice given their strength in COM development, is not novel, and the submitters of the patent would know this, as would anyone remotely familiar with Microsoft software development practices. And since a non-zero amount of time was spent on this patent, given all this foreknowledge, I'm going to continue to cite the asshole side of the corporate motivations for it.\r\n\r\nBTW the way I would come down just as hard on any software company who attempts this kind of thing, I'm not just posting to piss on Microsoft, though they clearly deserve it  in this instance.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166827742,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46370-fa08f3a3-db1e-4135-9903-bb5682ee73f7-1566236775"}

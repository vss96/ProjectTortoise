Mozart wrote opera, yeah, but he also wrote sonatas and concertos, the pop formats of his day.  Let me put it this way:\r\n\r\nPlay a big band number to your average twenty-something person, and he'll easily be able to follow it, to the point of boredom.  Same with jazz.  This music was more disciplined, even (or maybe especially) jazz, yeah, but not all that complex by today's standards.  I'm talking harmonically.  But play Pearl Jam, Sonic Youth, My Chem, or even a complex rap beat to a 70 year old, and they have a harder time following the music, or even identifying a melody.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this is hard science, just my observation.  But I take your point, especially considering your name.","controversiality":1,"link_id":"t3_tn3v","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807790,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cto1i","id":"ctohd","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8703-d6006e42-d267-482d-b3f6-41d74bf3ee79-1566236760"}

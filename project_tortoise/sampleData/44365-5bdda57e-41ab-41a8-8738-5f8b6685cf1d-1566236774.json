Honesty is a great policy isn't it.\r\n\r\nYes it's your right to believe in Joseph Smith.  But it's also our right to make some judgements on your character or intelligence based on the choices you make.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Joseph Smith he is a contemporary, so not only are there \"orthodox\" histories as to who he is, there is also secular history.  So it's more likely that non mormons are going to have a strong negative opinion of the man, and judge those who ignore the secular evidence, as deficient in their rational consideration of what most would see as factual information.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vnhg","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44365-5bdda57e-41ab-41a8-8738-5f8b6685cf1d-1566236774"}

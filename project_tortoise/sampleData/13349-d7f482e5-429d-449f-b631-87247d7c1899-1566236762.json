She was stopping people, begging for money almost hysterically. It was in the middle of freezing winter. A little bit later if you watch her, you notice she is not only standing near a warm manhole, she smells of vaseline. The vaseline covers her skin and keeps her warmer. She may have also had a drink or two to keep her feeling even warmer. When you come back in a few weeks or a month later, she's still pulling the same scam.\r\n\r\nI used to work in a welfare center, and I can say this is a scam. First off, it's a secret that women, especially because these are often mothers, are given the highest priority for at least, at a minimum, clothes, food, medicine and medical help, and perhaps a place to bathe or sleep. Men are put lower because they are often assumed not to have children. The priority order for granting homeless and poor men their needs is clothing, food, medicine and medical help, bathing, and shelter. So, for this woman to not get proper clothing even to the tiniest scrap, and that she must use trash bags, is clearly a scam. There is an abundance of spare clothing in the USA, and even if one has to stretch the clothing or use oversized clothing, there is still accommodation.\r\n\r\nJust down the road, a homeless man was begging for money. A wealthy couple went into the restaurant, purchased a nice meal, put it in a box, came outside, and asked if he would take it. The man refused. They opened it to prove to him that it had not been touched and was prepared just for him. But he refused. He wasn't homeless -- he was pulling a scam.\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ttog","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":1,"score":1,"created_utc":1165475985,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13349-d7f482e5-429d-449f-b631-87247d7c1899-1566236762"}

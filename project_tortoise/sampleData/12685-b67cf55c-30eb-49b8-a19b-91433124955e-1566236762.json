Unfortunately this kind of \"pick and choose\" attitude is too common.  \r\nI ran into a similar defense from my own sister recently - although luckily she didn't end up endangering anyone.  When I found out she was pregnant at 18 - to her boyfriend of about two weeks, with no real education or prospects, I asked her why she wasn't using contraception - her answer - \"i'm catholic. I don't believe in contraception\".  Apparently she ignored the bit about pre-marital sex.","retrieved_on":1473807943,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_truq","id":"ctwpd","author_flair_text":null,"author":"rraaarr","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12685-b67cf55c-30eb-49b8-a19b-91433124955e-1566236762"}

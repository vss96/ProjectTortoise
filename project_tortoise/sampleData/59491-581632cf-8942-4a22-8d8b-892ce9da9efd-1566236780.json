As they had the guy get out of his car they could have easily determined impairment via pupillary reflex or gait.  They did not appear at all concerned with whether or not this guy had been drinking.  If they were, they would have asked \"did you have anything to drink tonight\" rather than asking him where he was heading.  I got the impression that he was being fairly cooperative, he addressed the police officer as \"officer\" and even stepped out of the vehicle when asked.  There was no reason for any police officer to drive the person's car as they could have waved him over to the side of the road.  This is a regular practice at many of the DUI checkpoints I've been through.","score":7,"ups":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167531927,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"cwibb","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cwi5i","author":"ansgenius","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809712,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59491-581632cf-8942-4a22-8d8b-892ce9da9efd-1566236780"}

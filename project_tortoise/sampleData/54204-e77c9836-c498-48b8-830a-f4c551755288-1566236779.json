It's not so great for kids whose parents are struggling to make ends meet, who live in gang-infested neighborhoods, whose parents can't buy them microscopes or six months of straight dance lessons.  It's not so simple or beautiful as this example of a privileged student makes it out to be.\r\n\r\nThe upper middle class will completely abandon public education, it's only a matter of time.

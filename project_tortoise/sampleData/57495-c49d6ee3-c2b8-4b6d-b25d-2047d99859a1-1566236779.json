{"body":"Being anti-state may be patriotic, but it's also idiotic (here comes the liberedditarian beatdown). As evil, incompetent, overbearing, bungling, and nasty as the state can be, it's the *only effective means* by which citizens can constrain private power, which is also evil, incompetent, overbearing, bungling, and nasty as well as fundamentally unaccountable to anyone but its owners and managers. \r\n\r\nYes, government sucks in the US, but the governments of some other countries actually do more or less what their citizens want while still preserving civil liberties.

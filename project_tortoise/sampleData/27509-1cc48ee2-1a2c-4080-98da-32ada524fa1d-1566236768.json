There is no way I know of to get a foreskin back.  The only really substantive thing I can say is that in some men it does increase sensitivity, so it's not pure mutilation.\r\n\r\nOf course it IS a crapshoot.  If I was uncut I don't think I'd be willing to gamble on an irreversible operation like my Dad was.  Mostly he did it because my Mother's family though it was REAL important that my brother (and later I, but by then it was decided) be circumsized.  If it had made things worse then he would have arguned that in order to keep us whole.  He didn't have to worry about his family.  Same religion, but his side just doesn't take religion very seriously.\r\n\r\nSomething else on the anti-circumcision side:  There are certainly botched circumcisions, whith horrible results.  While I don't think the risks are severe enough to warrant passing any laws or anything to prevent parents from from getting their boys circumcized until they're adults or can at least choose for themselves, I must admit that there are some damned good reasons to put it off and let the kid make the decision on his/her own.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","link_id":"t3_uors","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808499,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Joss","parent_id":"t1_cuqc6","edited":false,"id":"cuqda","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27509-1cc48ee2-1a2c-4080-98da-32ada524fa1d-1566236768"}

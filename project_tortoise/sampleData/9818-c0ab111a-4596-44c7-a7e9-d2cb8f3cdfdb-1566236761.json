Indeed, Matt and Trey’s 1997 movie Orgazmo, which centers around a young Mormon missionary who ends up taking on the role of a superhero porn star, clearly reflects not only a great deal of knowledge of the Latter-day Saints but some real affection for the group.\r\n\r\nUm..I'm an atheist, and I managed to get the Mormon family down the street to watch Orgasmo. They found it hilarious. But they did find it offensive that the whole plot is based off the church charging money for services, when that's not the case. \r\n\r\nSo I'd say they were just making fun of the concept of a mormon porn star. Its a comedy they made -- let's not take it too seriously.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165351712,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9818-c0ab111a-4596-44c7-a7e9-d2cb8f3cdfdb-1566236761"}

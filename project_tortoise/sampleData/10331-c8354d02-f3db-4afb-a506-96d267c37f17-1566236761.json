To understand this you have to look at the economic behavior of people in different wealth categories. A person below the poverty line will not put a large amount of money into assets, but is more likely to spend it. The only real assets the numerous middle class owns arecars (with depreciate rapidly) and homes (that aren't fully owned for 20 years). If a person is rich (especially the super rich) its likely that they own a large amount of stock that in turn ranks them wealthy.

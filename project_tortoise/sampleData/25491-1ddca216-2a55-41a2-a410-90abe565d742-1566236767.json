Along the line as the first vertical cut I cut the onion in half.  Then I lay the flat part of the onion on the cutting board.\r\n\r\nThe next step is a matter off preference, for example if you need it sliced you start cutting horizontally top to bottom (the top being the top part of the onion you cut off), while trying to hold it in place.  Then cut it vertically.  You could choose to go vertical first, but I always found it difficult to it for the next cut.\r\n\r\nThe step where he makes horizontal slices is completely absurd.  When do you ever want to cut into something with a knife were the final resting position of the knife isn't on the cutting board?  Not to mention you don't need this amount of cutting the onion is already layered and will break apart at that level.  If anything you are creating to small of a piece.","link_id":"t3_ukve","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25491-1ddca216-2a55-41a2-a410-90abe565d742-1566236767"}

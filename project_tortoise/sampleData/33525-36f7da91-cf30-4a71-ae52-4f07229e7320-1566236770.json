I cannot help but wonder: Why is there no counter-conference in Riyadh, Cairo, Lahore, Khartoum or Jakarta condemning Ahmadinejad? Why are the 57 members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference silent on this?\" \r\n\r\nMaking a SERIOUS effort to correct this imbalance would do wonders for improving relations with Muslim communities the world over. I can't think of another major world religion that doesn't bend over backwards to condemn abuse and evil done in their name and at a volume and persistence great enough to drown out the troublemakers. Heck - even the athiests and Satanists go out of their way to correct \"mis-perceptions\" caused by their claimed followers. \r\n\r\nIslam is the one religion whose majority actions and inactions seem to confirm everyone else's worst fears about them. This is very unfortunate because *all* of the muslims I know are shamed and upset by this and they all feel powerless to do anything about it because they believe they will be ostracized by their leadership and community at large. Until this it corrected I'm afraid they've let the radicals define them.","controversiality":1,"retrieved_on":1473808742,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cv39d","parent_id":"t3_v1y6","author":"proteusguy","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33525-36f7da91-cf30-4a71-ae52-4f07229e7320-1566236770"}

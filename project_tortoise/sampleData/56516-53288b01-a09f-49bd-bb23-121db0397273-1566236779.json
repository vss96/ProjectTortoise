What his decision to kill rooks has to do with eating animals is never explained...and if, for example, more London society jackasses stayed in London rather than playing at farming, there would be more open land for birds, and less need to shotgun rooks.  As for putting down suffering animals, of course it's the right decision.  But we also put down injured and dying cats and dogs...does Alex feast on their kidneys with breakfast as well?  Doubtful.  If you want to eat meat, eat meat.  If you don't, don't.  But neither side should feel permitted (or indeed, obliged) to leap headfirst into self-righteousness.  Nothing pisses me off about columnists (particularly 'celebrity' columnists) as much as the 'I've made this decision, and so should you' claptrap that serves as page filler when no one's spouse or child has done something particularly annoying.\r\n\r\nAlex, go back to playing bass (or whatever instrument you played), and let the professionals farm (and for that matter, write).","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56516-53288b01-a09f-49bd-bb23-121db0397273-1566236779"}

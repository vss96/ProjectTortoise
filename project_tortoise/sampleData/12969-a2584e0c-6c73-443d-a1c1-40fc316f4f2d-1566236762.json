How does this benefit affluent people?\r\n\r\nPrecisely.  Affluence and education are very closely correlated.  Anything that benefits people with better grades will generally benefit affluent people far more often than poor people.\r\n\r\nIf you're the one of the few kids in your school whose family has books at home, a computer, if your parents went to college, you are probably going to be a stand-out.  A college has few slots for admissions, so it will concentrate those few kids from each location so that its whole class is composed of them, as nearly as possible.\r\n\r\nIn this case, if there are 70,000 eligible but only 5,000 slots, academic standards are going to accept the 7% whose families had books and houses and electricity, not the 93% who are poorer and may live in tents on the beach. \r\n\r\nThis perpetuates \"educational disadvantages\" for Native Hawaiians.\r\n\r\nHawaii has a big problem with its schools because the cost of living is high and the parents are often both working full-time to make ends meet, leaving the kids with little direction or educational support.  That problem doesn't exist in the minority of cases where the family has money, so the kids will do better in school.\r\n\r\nThe kids who need help the most are the ones with the poorest grades, who are almost always from the poorest homes.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12969-a2584e0c-6c73-443d-a1c1-40fc316f4f2d-1566236762"}

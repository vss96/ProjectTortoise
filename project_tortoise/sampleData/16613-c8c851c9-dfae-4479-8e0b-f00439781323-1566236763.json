{"controversiality":1,"body":"The question would work pretty well in an interview. Creating a completely bulletproof string-reversal procedure in C is not a plausible blackboard assignment (given that the applicant hasn't written one before), and any competent programmer knows that all too well, and would, without much hesitation, answer something like \"Well, it would crash\".\r\n\r\nThere are already more than enough \"clever\" pointer tricks in the world. Making code shorter with the side effect of making it impossible to understand without a thorough study or some deeper knowledge of logical operations is not an accomplishment (unless you're applying for IOCCC). It is just really fucking stupid.","link_id":"t3_u3fx","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165603127,"score":2,"ups":2,"author":"shp","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cu5do","parent_id":"t1_cu56h","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808106,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16613-c8c851c9-dfae-4479-8e0b-f00439781323-1566236763"}

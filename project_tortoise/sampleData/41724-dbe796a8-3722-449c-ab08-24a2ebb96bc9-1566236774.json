You need to verify them because the user can easily change values that are seemingly valid, but break business rules. For example, editting an hidden field on an HTML form to change the price of a concert ticket. \r\n\r\nI've seen it happen where someone got a 1,000 ticket for 20 bucks by changing the product code to some other event while leaving the event code alone.\r\n\r\nAs for string concatination and dynamic SQL leading to sql injection attacks, bullshit. \r\n\r\nIt isn't hard to call to escape single-quotes on incoming strings. Moreover, you have to do it anyways or your app will crash the first time Mr. O'Donald signs in. \r\n\r\nWhen you use a parametrized statement it essentially does the same thing, it escapes the quotes. The only real advantage you get is performance, which I admit is a good thing.\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vh2t","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","created_utc":1166647447,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41724-dbe796a8-3722-449c-ab08-24a2ebb96bc9-1566236774"}

And Infogami? [Three](http://blogging.infogami.com) [cool](http://javascript.infogami.com) [sites](http://pytut.infogami.com) (whoops, that last one is leaving) plus [36,600 spammers](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ainfogami.com).\r\n\r\nAnd now that they've made bank, there's definitely no incentive to improve. Let's watch in amazement as Reddit asymptotically approaches the same level of mediocrity that Slashdot and Digg have already achieved. Most of the good commenters already jumped ship around the time of the acquisition.\r\n\r\nWe've got browsers that support multiple kinds of security devices (certificates), we've got OpenID, we've had perfectly good license-free crypto tools for ages (with such horrible user interfaces that Johnny still can't encrypt all of 8 years later), \"Identity 2.0\" is coming down the pipe, and yet people like this poster still think that spam and trolls are a fact of life, that there's nothing that can possibly be done about it because nobody's done it right.\r\n\r\nSocial bookmarking has been \"ugly\" since before '98. Doesn't mean it can't be fixed.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w50r","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167269314,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54106-5f3eb436-32c9-497d-a3d6-4de1789f7b00-1566236779"}

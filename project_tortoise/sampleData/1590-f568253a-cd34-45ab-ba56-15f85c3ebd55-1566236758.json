{"body":"The difference in the analogy you provide is that deafness is a physical handicap - some part of the body is demonstrably not working right.  It is not just the social/cultural handicap that skin-color can represent.  This effectively stacks the deck against the deaf community.  It is unfortunate, given how hard this community has worked to create and define itself in the midst of a mostly indifferent population, but within two or three generations childhood deafness will be history and the deaf community will slowly fade away.  If you want to see the early death-spasms of the deaf community you need look no further than the various protests over the years at Gallaudet University (e.g. where the most recent president was hounded out of office by the students for \"not being deaf enough\" - she was 'hearing impaired' but did not grow up with ASL as her primary language...)","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_t7f8","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164994751,"ups":5,"score":5,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"evgen","parent_id":"t1_ct8pk","id":"ct931","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807500,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1590-f568253a-cd34-45ab-ba56-15f85c3ebd55-1566236758"}

(i'm correcting your spelling, i hope you didn't actually mean to say that a cumshot is a vagina.) why can't you just say having sex, why do you have to bring it down to porno terminology?\r\n\r\nthe difference between semen, eggs, and fetuses (feti?) is that semen only have the dna of the father, eggs only have the dna of the mother, and a fetus has its own unique dna.\r\n\r\nnow i know there's a whole argument that stems from that.. for example, it's not necessarily human dna right away. but at some point, between conception and birth, it's a human life. if you want to strip any dignity from sex by calling it a cumshot, that's your call.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19598-55f14eae-042e-4b69-aa1d-4ab28e92ba0c-1566236764"}

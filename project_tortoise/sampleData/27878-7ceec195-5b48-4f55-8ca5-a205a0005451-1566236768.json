I wrote \"European-derived country\". I'm talking about white people, not semites.\r\n\r\nBut, a lot of things in Israel *are* European-derived.  For starters, it was mostly the European Jews who began the struggle for Israel, not the ones in the Middle East.  Most of Israel's leaders are either descendants of or immigrants from Europe.  And they were not living in conflict with Arabs before Israel.\r\n\r\nBut I'll accept your point.  I know of no such similar incident in mainland Europe in the last few decades.","created_utc":1166100964,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27878-7ceec195-5b48-4f55-8ca5-a205a0005451-1566236768"}

That part had to move the water somewhere else, therefore the overall level rose.  But it does this based on mass (weight), not size or volume (or density, up to the point were it sinks).\r\n\r\nThe mass of water displaced equals the mass of the iceberg, not the parts above or below the water line - the whole thing.  If you cut away the part above the water, a new bit would rise to take its place - and the water level would fall.\r\n\r\nBecause this happens based on mass, not volume, when the ice melts, the mass is the same and it displaces an equal amount of water (even after the melted iceberg water mixes with the sea water).\r\n\r\nHTH","created_utc":1167257155,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"subreddit":"science","parent_id":"t1_cw69h","edited":false,"id":"cw6yd","author_flair_text":null,"author":"khayber","retrieved_on":1473809500,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"53821-d4f8b175-0b1f-4095-a443-db5a2582c1b5-1566236779"}

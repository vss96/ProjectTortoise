Just don't touch that stuff they call 'ground beef.'\r\n\r\nI worked there once during a summer vacation from college, practically living off it. It was a variation of the Atkins regimen...mostly just steak, beans, and cheese in tortillas. Between that, drinking about a gallon of water a day (granted, their fare is pretty high in sodium, but the water flushes it away), and walking at least 2 miles every night after work, I lost 25 pounds in the space of a month. It boggles the mind to consider it, but I actually felt healthy too. \r\n\r\nOf course I probably could've covered our monthly propane bill by farting into the stove.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165032488,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":8,"ups":8,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ctb8d","parent_id":"t1_ctaqc","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"xinhoj","retrieved_on":1473807540,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2783-017ebe99-f5e1-48d7-bf71-3dd846dd1076-1566236759"}

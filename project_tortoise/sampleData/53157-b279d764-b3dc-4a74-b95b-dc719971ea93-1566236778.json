I'm sure there are plenty of back-line jobs in an operation like this that aren't particularly dangerous, and you could help in those places if you're not a particularly adventurous person.  But who has the dedication to give up days and weeks of their time to help?  That's impressive.  Turbotad is right about anyone who happens to help out regardless of whether they are Scientologists or not.  But the Scientologists are particularly impressive because there aren't very many of them.  The small armies of Volunteer Ministers that turn out in disasters like this represent a significant percentage of Scientologists.  Nevertheless, I salute anyone who can and will help.  It's a big job.","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53157-b279d764-b3dc-4a74-b95b-dc719971ea93-1566236778"}

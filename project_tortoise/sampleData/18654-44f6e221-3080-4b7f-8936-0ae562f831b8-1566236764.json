Truth be told, many times MDMA is mixed by some schmuck that has never picked up a chemistry book in his/her life and is now taking your life into their hands for a quick buck. I have had the sad experience of watching several friends spiral out of control due to the MDMA / Ice scene where I live and it put me off the stuff completely... I've pretty much stuck to the \"hippie\" set with no real desire to go much further.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not saying that MDMA is the only unsafe drug. Each drug has it's down side (and I'm including alcohol and tobacco) but some are just less dangerous than others.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u73f","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18654-44f6e221-3080-4b7f-8936-0ae562f831b8-1566236764"}

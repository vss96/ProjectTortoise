They used a random traffic stop to perform a search utterly without probable cause. This sort of behavior affects *my* rights, because it indicates a social arena in which my fundamental Constitutional rights are malleable. For me, it isn't a matter of feelings or sympathies. \r\n\r\nAnd any cop that uses a routine stop to perform a search without probable cause should be *fired*, because *he deliberately broke the law in the performance of his duties*. Just like if the kid were drunk, he should be arrested. The law matters. Even for cops.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809700,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cwhnd","parent_id":"t1_cwhk9","author":"anonymous-coward","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59126-dd669244-d19e-457e-8a7f-16e405445c06-1566236780"}

Contrary to the myths propounded by promoters, sports are instruments not for human expression, but of social stasis.\" -- George Sage, *Journal of Physical Education and Recreation*\r\n\r\n\"Sport does not simply build character, in other words; it builds exactly the kind of character that is most useful for the social system. From the perspective of our social (and economic) system -- which is to say, from the perspective of those who benefit from and direct it -- it is useful to have people regard each other as rivals. Sports serve the purpose nicely, and athletes are quite deliberately led to accept the value and naturalness of an adversarial relationship in place of solidarity and collective effort. If he is in a team sport, the athlete comes to see cooperation only as a means to victor, to see hostility and even aggression as legitimate, to accept conformity and authoritarianism.\" -- Alfie Kohn, *No Contest*\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w0bb","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809381,"author":"Alex3917","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cw0re","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw0ee","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50437-691f2128-1632-4235-8d25-815566308a8a-1566236778"}

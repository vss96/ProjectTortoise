{"body":"I have a recent story about this. I was coding up an algorithm that I wanted to get to run faster in OCaml. I was inspecting the assembly code produced by the optimizing compiler and profiling it. I didn't find any clear bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nI Googled around for papers on the algorithm I was working on and found a 2004 paper that makes a slight change to the algorithm (3 pages to explain why to do it and what, &lt; 10 lines of code to add). It improved convergence speed by orders of magnitude because it was a smarter algorithm. Some further tweaks to it and I got another order of magnitude of improvement.

Yes, let's redefine *all* problems in the context of your pet problem. When you get overcharged on your phone bill, is there a secret christian conspiracy to tap out your bank account with bogus long distance charges?\r\n\r\nWhen they get your order wrong at Burger King, forgetting the bacon, is the jewish cabal trying to force you to obey judaic dietary laws?\r\n\r\nWhy do muslims run around in the middle of the night, creating potholes with jackhammers?\r\n\r\n&gt;However the excuse for the killings was religion.\r\n\r\nOh gee! You're absolutely right. People are so awful at making up excuses, that if we can somehow deny them this one excuse, they'll never, ever think up another one ever again. Why didn't I think of that?!\r\n\r\nBut go ahead, I already knew I wasn't like you or anyone else that calls themselves an atheist.

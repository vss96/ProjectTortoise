Other people bring up Java, which shares SOME but not ALL of the issues mentioned by Rainer. These people seem to be confused, because they seem to believe things like \"Java has these issues but is commercially successful, therefore these issues are irrelevant.\" Or, they just claim \"Java is a perfect fit. What mismatch?\" My response is that Java is obviously not a natural fit to current OSs in multiple ways, and that should be obvious after the slightest amount of observation about Java implementations, but apparently Java is able to overcome these obstacles to achieve success in the market. \r\n\r\nAs for Python in your example, I claim it has some of the same \"misfit\" features. Can you debug programs in the Python language using the system debugger? Why does Python have the Global Interpreter Lock? Why is it taking so long for the language to be routinely compiled to native machine code? \r\n\r\nI believe you have the custom IDE and dev tools vs. java acceptance reversed; part of what makes Java development tolerable is IDE's tuned to make the laborious aspects of Java programming less laborious. What do you believe the forces were that caused custom IDEs and tools to be developed? Too much spare developer time? My point about GUI frameworks, is, although Java may be \"batteries included\", they had to develop Java-brand batteries, instead of using all the existing infrastructure that OS environments provide.","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807825,"gilded":0,"id":"ctqd3","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctpjq","author":"sickofthisshit","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9547-f547bce5-5ea0-4969-98d5-a4c2e985c868-1566236761"}

I'm not saying that such sources are always trustworthy, but because I've heard of them before, I'm able to judge them better.\r\n\r\nHow can I judge ripoffreport.com and anonymous James from New York City? After taking a look at the site's [FAQ](http://www.ripoffreport.com/faq.asp#what) it appears that they take anonymous submissions from anyone. There's no way that they can fact check that, and therefore, there is no reason why I should trust this story.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w9jz","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55514-62f78054-eedc-463e-a007-a6af6c6bfe5c-1566236779"}

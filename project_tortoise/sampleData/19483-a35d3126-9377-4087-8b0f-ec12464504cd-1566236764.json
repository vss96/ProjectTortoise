By restricting the right to bear arms to the militia, which we know today as the National Guard, we would be in fact banning arms across the board.\r\n\r\nThe militarily by its very nature is armed, and there would be no need to codify that in the bill of rights unless you are suggesting without that provision we would have an unarmed military.\r\n\r\nIf the framers of the constitution did not have the intent of allowing the citizenry to arm themselves, then we would have seen some attempt when they were still alive and in power to make that happen. There was no such attempt, and to my knowledge no debate on the issue.

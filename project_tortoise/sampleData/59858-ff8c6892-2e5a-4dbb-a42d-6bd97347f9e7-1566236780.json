While I do agree that is sucks not know which program is using a file, to simply crash it by yanking the file out from under it is not acceptable.\r\n\r\nThis goes to the general problem with all variants of unix, no decent file locking. File locking in linux is like leaving the front door open with a sign that says \"Locked\". Windows, on the other hand, actually locks the file at an OS level like god intended.\r\n\r\n&gt; 3) MSN Messenger does not run on Linux.\r\n\r\nThis is just plain stupid. It isn't hard to uncheck the box for Messenger, and I have never had it reappear. You don't need a registry hack or anything like that.\r\n\r\n&gt; 4) \"Safely remove your external storage device\"\r\n\r\nThat is a hold over from older versions of Windows. You normally don't need to use that with the current version of Windows XP for flash drives. Mass storage drives, on the other hand, should use it because of the amount of disk caching going on. Unless of course you like to trash your files.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_wis7","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809725,"author":"grauenwolf","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wis7","id":"cwj0e","timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59858-ff8c6892-2e5a-4dbb-a42d-6bd97347f9e7-1566236780"}

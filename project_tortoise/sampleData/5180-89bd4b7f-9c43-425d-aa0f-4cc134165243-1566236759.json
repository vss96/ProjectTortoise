They're always a controversial and visible presence, but can't seem to win any true victories at the national level. All of their favorite Presidents - Reagan, both Bushes -- only paid lip service to their core agenda, and didn't really put any of it into action. The school prayer amendment in the 1980s didn't pass (albeit just barely), and their biggest issue, abortion, has stalled consistently since Roe (example: South Dakota's failed ban on abortion just this year). I guess the long and short of it is, to me, that they're annoying and sometimes quite scary, but are certainly nowhere near the mainstream force their supporters (and some opponents) claim they are.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tdgp","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1165169731,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5180-89bd4b7f-9c43-425d-aa0f-4cc134165243-1566236759"}

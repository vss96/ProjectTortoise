Many people fresh out of Uni have read and learned a lot ABOUT programming, but they aren't too valuable at work because they don't have any practical experience.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many a self-taught hacker who spent 3 hours each night hacking at some open source project are far more proficient. \r\n\r\nTo understand things ABOUT programming, one must have experience with doing the actual programming. One must have written a few programs from scratch to understand how programming languages scale beyond the hello world and the factorial. One must have written large systems before he can meaningfully reason about the relative merits of typing systems, and so on.\r\n\r\nThere's only so much one can learn by reading ABOUT.

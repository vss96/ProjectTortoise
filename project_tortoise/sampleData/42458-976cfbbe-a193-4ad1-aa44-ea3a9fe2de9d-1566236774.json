Pistol (aim foot), pepper spray, car keys....\r\n\r\nUh, what?\r\n\r\n1. Aiming for the foot with a gun is a good way to miss.  If the guy's serious about doing you ill, it affords him the opportunity to counteract the advantage of a firearm.  If you're going to shoot at someone, *shoot to kill*.  Don't screw around -- that's just a way to get *yourself* killed instead.\r\n\r\n2. Car keys?  Are you serious?  I think you've been to too many of those mid-'80s \"empowerment\" courses for women.  Tuck the keys between your fingers like this, scratch the guy, piss him off, get killed.  Good plan.\r\n\r\nYour points one through three make good sense for most people.  Point four needs a little more qualification (there are times that a weapon shouldn't be used), and two out of three subpoints are a little wacky.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809080,"gilded":0,"id":"cvkxd","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvk2n","author":"apotheon","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42458-976cfbbe-a193-4ad1-aa44-ea3a9fe2de9d-1566236774"}

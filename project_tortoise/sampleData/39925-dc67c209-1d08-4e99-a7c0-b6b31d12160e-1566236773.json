{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; Imagine you have been sentenced to jail for 50 years for murder. But you are really innocent (someone set you up). You serve your sentence and when the 50 years is up, you are so angry that you kill the person who set you up. The question is: should you go to jail for a further 50 years or have you already served your sentence in the last 50 years?\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much asking if you have been sentenced for a crime you did not commit, do you basically get a \"get out of jail free\" card that you can redeem for the next few crimes you commit? (assuming that they caught the real criminal after you completed your sentence).\r\n\r\nHow about this instead, imagine a person stole your identity (your name for example) and had a romantic relationship with another person while pretending to be you. The person is then caught and you are notified of their actions. Does this mean you are automatically entitled to a romantic relationship with your fraud's lover? What if the fraud wrote a novel, or published a paper under your name, do the rights to that work become immediately attributed to you?\r\n\r\nIn both cases, no of course not. The events that took place involved other people, not you. So (regarding the original question) if you were wrongly punished for a crime you did not commit, well that is the justice system's fault. That does not give you a right to infringe upon the inalienable right to life of a third party who is uninvolved. Then you would wrong them, and they deserve justice, and you should serve another n number of years. In this case, it was the justice system that wronged you, your beef is with them. You can sue them, or sell your story to the media and make them look stupid. Ultimately they took away years of their life and can't return it; but that does not give you the right to do that to anyone else.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_veo0","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":12,"ups":12,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166578587,"author":"random_hyp","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_veo0","edited":false,"id":"cvfuu","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808981,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39925-dc67c209-1d08-4e99-a7c0-b6b31d12160e-1566236773"}

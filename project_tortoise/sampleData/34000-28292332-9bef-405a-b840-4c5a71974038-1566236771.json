{"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v1y6","controversiality":0,"body":"The Zionists asked for something and they got it after the holocaust.  Through the help of barbaric colonizing powers they got a land that they had laid claim to according to their religious tradition and had not occupied for centuries.  They walked into a hostile neighborhood and armed themselves and prepared to defend it.  This is the reality of their situation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they misjudged the character of the people that they were displacing, or the strength of their supporters.  Perhaps they hoped that the conflict would die down.  I suspect that with their dogmatic views regarding their right to this piece of land they did not really care what the outcome would be.  To deny the right to the land would be to essentially deny who they were.  Without the state of Israel to them the whole concept of \"The Jew\" is a fairy tale.\r\n\r\nThey are supported by a west which has not magically, but systematically, been led to believe that the existence of Israel is of tantamount importance.  Partly because of their role in it's birth in 1948, but mostly through the creative work of agents of the state of Israel.  The effective propagation of Zionist philosophy, through the media, through the financial markets, through the education system, through christianity has created a culture of unopposed support in much of the western world.\r\n\r\nThe Zionists are to be commended for the thoroughness of their campaign.  They knew from the beginning that this would be more than a military war, and they have fought it well.  On the other hand the palestinians, and the larger muslim world have been sloppy in their fight.  They have not been unified, unsurprisingly, and they have done little to win public support for their cause.\r\n\r\nThe Zionists will continue to win as long as they have the support of their western counterparts.  If the Muslim world is to win this is the front that they need to attack.  All other engagements, even nuclear weapons are pointless scrimmages which they CANNOT win.","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166374129,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cv4b8","parent_id":"t1_cv2bn","author_flair_text":null,"author":"rahrahrah","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808761,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34000-28292332-9bef-405a-b840-4c5a71974038-1566236771"}

No offense, but I have met people who think they have worked on a \"large\" project but haven't even worked in one team, let alone had to cordinate the efforts of multiple teams working on the same code base.\r\n\r\nAnd just so you know, in my case there were roughly 6 teams and over 5 thousand source files in ASP alone, I cannot remember the ASPX and non-web code counts. I hesitate to count lines of code, as in-line HTML can really exagerates the count. Then again file counts are hard because ASPX creates three files per web page and one large class file can have more logic than a dozen helper classes combined.\r\n\r\nAnyways, can you go into more detail on why Python and Ruby make it easier for you large projects? What sort of problems did you have in each? How often did your error logs show issues that would have been caught by a compiler with stricter type checking?\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809216,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cvrl4","id":"cvs04","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"grauenwolf","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45984-be5b1310-3bd7-495b-8c65-2479760ff811-1566236775"}

Bush and the last round of Republicans in Congress really betrayed me. What a bunch of traitors, idiots, and technophobes as well. \r\n\r\n(And while I'm on this topic, my fellow Republicans also betrayed me. Prior to the Bush administration, we were all singing from the same page. When the Bush administration started to turn some non-conservative twists, we all grumbled about it. But then when it came time for elections with the Republican dopes in Congress, and many of them Bush supporters, not a single Republican friend of mine spoke out against them. So I'm definitely not Libertarian, and not Democrat, but this round of Republicans these days really lost me. They've turned out to be RINOs -- Republicans in Name Only. But I digress....)\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vjmv","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809083,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"supermike","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvku7","id":"cvl3t","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42564-f3d6b061-7c2c-4e27-ba63-645ffe211fd1-1566236774"}

Your visual systems are smart enough to notice that, overall, you're looking through a transparent blue or a transparent yellow. It then compensates color perception based on these filters, giving you a sense of what the true color would be if the semi-transparent filter were removed.\r\n\r\nSure the color values are the same (or close) when you use something to the effect of Photoshop's eye-dropper to compare composite color values, but you have to understand that your visual system is taking into account the surrounding screen of solid color (same can be said for shadows).\r\n\r\nYour brain calculates based on surroundings, and gives your conscious a close approximation of the color's value based on other color values (screens, shadows, et al.). While this is a great example of that, I might disagree with the amazing part of the title.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t1z0","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807441,"author":"actionscripted","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ct5wk","parent_id":"t3_t1z0","timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"22-c37fbb00-20df-47d1-967d-9541983f2756-1566236758"}

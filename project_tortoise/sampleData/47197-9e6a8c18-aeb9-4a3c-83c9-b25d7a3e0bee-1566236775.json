Prince William Sound was actually already being monitored when the spill happened because ecologists were watching how an ecosystem recovers from an earthquake.  In this case, an earthquake from the 60s, 25 years before the spill.\r\n\r\nExxon tried two tactics to clean-up the oil, a burn and some chemical that neutralizes to some degree the negative effects of the oil (I'm not a chemist, and don't know exactly what it does--sorry).  Anyway, a small controlled burn on an isolated part of the spill was successful but not attempted for such a large spill.  The chemical didn't work because it wasn't mixing with the oil (not enough waves/too much oil, depending on who you ask).  It seems like a poor idea to clean up tens of millions of gallons of oil by adding tens of millions of gallons of chemicals anyway, so that approach was also abandoned.  That means just paying people to ride around in boats skimming oil, spraying down rocks and shoreline with high-pressure water, and giving animals baths in that chemical I mentioned above.  Which is expensive, and cost in the neighborhood of $2B (1990 dollars).  \r\n\r\nThen enter the courts.  Naturally there were criminal charges against the captain and in turn his employer.  There were also civil suits by anyone who's business was impacted by the spill (which is basically everyone in Alaska).  Between legal fees, settlements with the state, and settlement with some of the civil suits, Exxon spent another $1B or so, for a total of around $3B out-of-pocket.\r\n\r\nThe last big unknown, for which they haven't paid a dime, is a class action suit representing everyone who didn't file their own civil suit.  The plaintiffs calculated their personal loss because of the spill, and that came to almost $300 million.  Why didn't Exxon just pay them, since they'd already spent 10 times that on the cleanup??  Because the suit sought punitive damages based not on the cost of cleanup or the damages to the plaintiffs, but based on the company's annual profits (designed to match or slightly exceed one year of profits, above and beyond the loss in profit caused by such a huge spill).\r\n\r\nThe penalty was awarded by a jury, and has been fluctuating ever since as judges decide whether the jury was too harsh or too lenient.  The only reason Exxon would stop appealing now that's it's reduced by half is because in the past an appeal court actually increased damages, so they might want to quit while they're ahead.  Whenever they decide to pay out, you won't see a change in gas prices, because they already have the money sitting there earning interest until the appeal process is over.","score":9,"ups":9,"created_utc":1166879902,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"47197-9e6a8c18-aeb9-4a3c-83c9-b25d7a3e0bee-1566236775"}

The right way is **not** to verify strings before concatting them in the SQL statement. This is error-prone, you should not embed the values in the query at all.\r\n\r\nYou should use bind variables instead: have question marks in place of the parameters, and set them via the API. The SQL will look like:\r\n\r\n    select col1, col2 from table where col3 = ?\r\n\r\nThe database itself will check the type of the value you are trying to put, and special symbols in strings become non-issue.\r\n\r\nThis has an added benefit: performance. Decent databases cache query plans based on checksum of the query itself. SQL statements using bind variables will avoid re-parsing and making query plan for the same query over and over again, while the queries with values embedded in the SQL will have different checksum every time.","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"40578-1c8fcb90-91d8-42b3-8de6-6efea9e4f381-1566236773"}

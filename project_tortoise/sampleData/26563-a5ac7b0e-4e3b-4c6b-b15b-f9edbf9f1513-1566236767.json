It's a quite a challenge, especially if you try to find one that can be used by both blind and hearing impaired.\r\n\r\nSo far, the best solution accessibility wise is one with multiple choice question which relies on human intelligence to pass the check.\r\n\r\nAlso, all technical solutions (those that don't require user action) should be also seriously considered - for example Hashcash, dummy form elements, heuristics, etc. They are completely transparent to user and hence are don't have accessibility problems.","link_id":"t3_ujbj","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","subreddit":"programming","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165994258,"score":1,"ups":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"26563-a5ac7b0e-4e3b-4c6b-b15b-f9edbf9f1513-1566236767"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"The problem now is that Saudi Arabia, home to a Sunni majority, will not appreciate the US leaving them to take care of the mess that Bush started. They can't choke off Iranian support for the Shiites by raising oil production thus dropping oil prices. So their alternative is to cut production, sending a message to Washington that if the US tries to pull out now, oil prices will get much higher since Saudi's 9B barrel production could easily become 4B barrels and as tight as the oil market is now, prices would easily top $100/barrel. \r\n\r\nIf you listen to Bush's response to Baker and Hamilton's report, he's very noncommital about pulling the troops out. He's really fucked now, if he takes the advice of Baker and the overwhelming majority of US citizens and pulls troops, Saudi is pissed and oil is $100 virtually halting the US economy, but if he keeps the troops there, he has to admit that the whole war, and the decision to stay, had nothing to do with terrorism and the cost of the war in lives and dollars will continue to rise without limit.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u6ti","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165674351,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"borg","parent_id":"t1_cu6xy","edited":false,"id":"cu8gw","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808163,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18384-d1b69d63-3ab0-4ccc-892b-0dac5398735b-1566236764"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"The article is one big blinding flash of the perfectly obvious.\r\n\r\nIf you're in a hospital over the weekend, it's nearly impossible to find a doctor or get any non-emergency services, so you end up hanging around longer for no reason other than doctors and lab techs hate working weekends.\r\n\r\nWhat a surprise -- I hate working weekends, too.\r\n\r\nThe darker side to this is that the people working weekends and nights are always the least experienced, so if you have something seriously wrong with you, your odds of survival are somewhat worse.\r\n\r\nAgain, perfectly obvious -- the first thing an experienced doctor or nurse does once they have enough seniority is stop working weekends and move to first shift.

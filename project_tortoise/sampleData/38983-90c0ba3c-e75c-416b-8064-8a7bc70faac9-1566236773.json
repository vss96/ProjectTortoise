Note that all numbers are in PDF pages.\r\n\r\nClaim: Our federal deficits alone now total more than 400% of GDP.\r\n\r\n\r\nFact: The US GDP is around 11 Trillion dollars (google it). Our 2006 budget deficit worked out to 500 billion dollars (pg 42). Our total debt outstanding as a percent of GDP is around 40% (pg 14). He is off by an order of magnitude. I will explain this in more detail later.\r\n\r\nClaim: And let me clarify something. The $53 trillion shortfall is expressed as a ‘net present value’. That means that in order to make the shortfall disappear we’d have to have that amount of cash in the bank – today  - earning interest (the GAO uses 5.7% &amp; 5.8% as the assumed long-term rate of return). \r\n\r\n\r\nFact: What you're seeing is the sum of all liabilities adjusted for all years down the road. Raising taxes for SOSI will cut this drastically, as the writer notes. These numbers are presented on page 46. You should note that these are unaudited numbres, and that we can subtract from them the NPV of all future taxes. He presents this number to show the growth in future liabilities.\r\n\r\nClaim: And how about the fact that boomers begin retiring in 2008…that always seemed to be waaaay out in the future. However, beginning January 1st  we can start referring to 2008 as ‘next year’ instead of ‘some point in the future too distant to get concerned about now’. Our economic problems need to be classified as growing, imminent, and unsustainable.\r\n\r\n\r\nFact: Demographic changes cause our current SOSI challenges. The program has been adjusted before to solve for these sorts of problems, and doing so now would not be unprecedented. The problems we face now are not new. Another raise in the retirement age or an increase in SOSI taxes will solve the problem.\r\n\r\nClaim:For the record, 5.7% on $53 trillion is a bit more than $3 trillion dollars so you can see how the math is working against us here.\r\n\r\n\r\nFact: Again, this ignores future revenue which is used to pay for these programs (taxes).\r\n\r\nClaim: Perhaps the reason US bonds and the dollar have held up so well is that we are far from alone in our predicament. In a recent article detailing why the UK Pound Sterling may fall, we read this horrifying evidence:\r\n\r\n\r\nFact: Economic troubles are not the only reason the dollar is falling against the euro: the end of a long rate tightening cycle, and expected drops in interest rates early next year contribute largely to the dollar's drop. US Market performance remains good.\r\n\r\nClaim: If we perform the same calculations for the US, however, we find that the official debt stands at $8.507 trillion or 65% of (nominal) GDP but when we add in our “off balance sheet” items the national debt stands at $53 trillion or 403% of GDP.\r\n\r\n\r\nFact: Hogwash. Everyone knows adjustments must be made to these entitlement programs, and this number completely ignores taxes which will be used to pay for these programs.\r\n\r\nClaim:There is no way to ‘grow out of this problem’. What really jumps out is that the US financial position has deteriorated by over $22 trillion in only 4 years and $4.5 trillion in the last 12 months (see table below, from page 10 of the report). The problem did not ‘get better’ as a result of the excellent economic growth over the past 3 years but rather got worse and is apparently accelerating to the downside. \r\n\r\n\r\nFact: Minor adjustments to social security should get us out of this problem.\r\n\r\nClaim:You should be aware that the budgetary assumptions of the US government are for greater than 5% nominal GDP growth through at least 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\nFact: Inflation stands around 3% right now. 2% real GDP growth over an 80 year period is a reasonable expectation.\r\n\r\nClaim: The future will be defined by lowered standards of living.\r\n\r\n\r\nFact: Technological development often outweighs any government damage. Each generation usually lives longer, healthier lives than the one before it. This will not stop because of large taxes or large debt.\r\n\r\nClaim: Every government facing this position has opted to “print its way out of trouble”.\r\n\r\n\r\nFact: The US's quality of debt is generally very good. Taxation can still be heavily raised, at great cost, to cut our debt to zero quite rapidly. The US will always choose to refinance debt rather than hyperinflate, even if US interest rates are forced upward, or exchange rates forced downward. We aren't Russia, and this isn't 1998.\r\n\r\nClaim: What we need is a good, old-fashioned grassroots campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nFact: Common people do not understand macroeconomic theory. Even on this page, people advocate buying fewer goods as a society. Of course, if we, collectively, buy fewer goods, we hurt our economy, as our consumption is directly linked to our income (I am ignoring some complications here, but the theory still holds): Every dollar spent is a dollar in someone else's pocket. If we don't spend, the only people we hurt are ourselves. Google \"Paradox of thrift\" if you do not believe me.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vc4j","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":11,"ups":11,"created_utc":1166555106,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"38983-90c0ba3c-e75c-416b-8064-8a7bc70faac9-1566236773"}

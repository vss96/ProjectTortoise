If the kid had decided the best thing to do was to pick up the trash can containing the gun and bring the trash can to the teacher would that have been possession?  How about if he decided to just kick the trash can along the hallway to the teacher. Or how about if he stood guard over the trash can and didn't allow anyone to touch it while someone else went to get the teacher.  What if it was not in a trash can but in a brown paper bag in the hallway where someone might step on it or kick it.  Where exactly do you draw the line?  \r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as zero tolerance just zero intelligence","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"31507-02b61019-e5b3-406f-8c6d-0dc3325db1bf-1566236770"}

Ocaml is sort of gross, but I like the revised syntax http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-camlp4/manual007.html\r\n\r\nOz syntax is sort of weird, but it has some nice ideas that could be used in other languages.\r\n\r\nPython syntax is nice. On the other hand, Perl syntax is difficult to classify on a scale of nice to horrid; it requires a scale of lingustic classification with a dimension for acid trip induced glossolalia. Perl6 seems to be moving further into the realm of consensual shared hallucination. I look forward to using it.\r\n\r\nS-exprs are pretty good. There's nothing wrong with minimalist syntax and they really are easy to learn from scratch. It's surprising to me that they're not more widespread. Sweet-expressions are very nice.\r\n\r\nC isn't bad, but C++ is like a proof that adding syntax to an existing language is a bad idea. Java and C# don't improve on C syntax. D is nicer, but I prefer MLish type notation.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uqo3","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808509,"distinguished":null,"author":"Excedrin","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cuqvx","parent_id":"t3_uqo3","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27719-d1c4d01e-1e1d-4157-9031-1376d474ec52-1566236768"}

It's not too hard to implement hashing with backwards compatibility such that upon next login the password is hashed (I've done it before, though, granted, on a smaller scale).\r\n\r\nAdditional edit:  Although I tried that password link and I couldn't for the life of me get the email thing to work (none of my email addresses seemed to be registered).  And then I note that you don't need an email address to register (to my chagrin, due to spammers and such).  So if you've forgotten your login/pass you seem to be sunk.

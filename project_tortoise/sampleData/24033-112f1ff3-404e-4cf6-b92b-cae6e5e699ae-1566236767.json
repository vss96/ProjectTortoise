In our eco-friendly world we say \"wow, a city built for no cars\" and think it's great, but the reason it wasn't built for cars wasn't because they were great urban planners, it's because there were no cars.\r\n\r\nI respectfully disagree. Most North American cities have happily, perhaps even gleefully gutted and razed their pre-automobile urban environments to accommodate cars, in the process destroying dense, viable, livable, humanely-scaled neighbourhoods and replacing them with colossal horizontal wastelands of asphalt and painted lines, punctuated with monotonous prefab boxes with garish, cartoony adornments and a 20 year shelf life. \r\n\r\nThat was not modernization, progress, or even inevitability. It was a monumental screw-up, plain and simple. Those few neighbourhoods that did not suffer \"renewal\" during the postwar era are the most valuable, high quality neighbourhoods on the continent. This is not because they're \"quaint\" but because they *work* at a human scale. They're well-built, attractive, social, and convenient. These are not anachronisms but elementary, timeless principles of good urban design.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_uga5","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24033-112f1ff3-404e-4cf6-b92b-cae6e5e699ae-1566236767"}

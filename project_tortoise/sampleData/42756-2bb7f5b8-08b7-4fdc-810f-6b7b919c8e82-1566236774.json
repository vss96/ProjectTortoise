Very efficient, but really dangerous if the guy your fighting has friends. If he does, you don't want to be stuck on the ground, leaving all sorts of easy targets for his friends to kick. (Every fighting style has its weaknesses.) \r\n\r\nI recently saw some poor slob get beat down by 4 or 5 gangbanger kids. They looked like they planned the whole thing. One guy starts the fight, and as soon as they're both on the ground, all the gangbanger's friends jumped in and started kicking the guy. Not pretty.","created_utc":1166683960,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":9,"ups":9,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42756-2bb7f5b8-08b7-4fdc-810f-6b7b919c8e82-1566236774"}

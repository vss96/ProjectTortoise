Really? What about the problems of systemic poverty that Walmart and Nike bring? What about the poverty problem of FDI and (as Marx termed it)ownership of the means of production. These companies are not there as a \"godsend\", they are they to pump wealth (in the form of cheap labour) out of the country and claim stock and profit gain in the Western or tax sheltered nations. It would be one thing if a nation could use its cheap labour to increase profits for people and businesses within the country (and sufficient income balancing to maintain a middle class). But Nike and Walmart are not doing that. Nike and Walmart prefer these regions to stay poor and labour to remain cheap. And they prefer profits to be claimed in the West to keep their markets flush with cash to spend on goods.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ul6o","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-3,"ups":-3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165961912,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25768-3157eaa4-0d9c-4da4-b25b-4e2bffc0f163-1566236767"}

The desire to buy shit that everybody else has is greater than self comfort or lofty ideals.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest raw divide-and-conquer method by legalizing prostitution and giving extra incentives for those in the business to drive illegal business out.\r\n\r\nOtherwise \"getting rid of prostitution\" equals \"giving any woman requesting all the money she wants, for shopping\". And I don't point here to women, who really need money for survival, for food and family; They should be helped for real, so they need not do what they didn't want.\r\n\r\nIt's just that there will always be so many of those who want more and are willing to do anything to get it. If that condition is not managed somehow, then there will always be a thriving black market that has more money than any other instance in society.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v3qa","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"35168-68bb55c5-c1c1-4fb9-80eb-cdfef0801fdc-1566236771"}

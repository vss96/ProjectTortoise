There are several levels of literacy, however not being at the \"proficient\" level leaves college grads unable to:\r\n\r\n1. read lengthy,complex,abstract prosetexts, synthesize information, and make complex inferences.\r\n\r\n2. integrate,synthesize,and analyze multiple pieces of information located in complex documents\r\n\r\n3. locate more abstract quantitative information and use it to solve multistep problems when the arithmetic operations are not easily inferred and the problems are more complex.\r\n\r\n4. compare viewpoints in two editorials\r\n\r\n5. interprate a table about blood pressure,age, and physical activity\r\n\r\n6. compute and compare the cost per ounce of food items\r\n\r\nIf they are unable to compare the viewpoints in two editorials, that essentially means they are unable to make an intelligent choice about who to vote for...\r\n\r\nIn addition, 15% of America has a \"below basic\" literacy level. This means they may or may not be able to write their name, but they can't really do anything more than that. True Fact: Many cash registers at fast food restaurants are color coded so that even employees with limited reading skills can operate them.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: http://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/PDF/2006470.PDF\r\n\r\nThose bastards hid the PDF file, and it took me a while to find it.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ut1n","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808574,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Alex3917","parent_id":"t1_cuty8","edited":false,"id":"cuuf3","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"29440-0c64490c-1afe-4c9f-8be8-7540ac5bd9c7-1566236769"}

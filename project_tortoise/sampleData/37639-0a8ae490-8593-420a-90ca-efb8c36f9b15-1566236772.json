Specifically, it's limited to \"claims of Microsoft-owned or Microsoft-controlled patents that are necessary to implement only the required portions of the Covered Specification that are described in detail and not merely referenced in such Specification\" -- this sets off alarm bells in my head that MS Office interop will only really be achievable by implementing non-required and, hence, non-covered technologies which Microsoft reserves the right to go to sue people over.\r\n\r\nAnd so, of course, there's a chance -- since nobody really seems to know how the MS/Novell agreement works -- that Novell will end up being the only entity legally able to implement true interoperability with MS Office. Given that, an extremely cautious position toward any OO.o code coming out of Novell seems to be the only tenable position until there's been time to review what Novell is releasing and compare it against the submitted OpenXML standard to make sure it's clean and completely covered by Microsoft's no-lawsuit promises.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_va1x","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808896,"distinguished":null,"author":"ubernostrum","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvbeb","parent_id":"t3_va1x","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37639-0a8ae490-8593-420a-90ca-efb8c36f9b15-1566236772"}

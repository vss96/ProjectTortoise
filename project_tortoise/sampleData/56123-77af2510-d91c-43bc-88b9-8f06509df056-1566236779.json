Infatacide is also a perfectly normal human action, but not being a 100% attentive to the baby in your pram, such that it could be murdered, does not absolve the psychopath who did it from an iota of responsability. By the same token a shoplifter who ‘just had to have’ the item they filched (or was stealing because the item would bring them status) is still committing a crime.\r\n\r\n(Granted insanity might clear both the latter criminals, but by the same token a rapist might be doing it because the angels told him to)\r\n\r\nBut as for modest VS immodest dress, if you set the concept that wearing revealing garments is ‘asking for it’ you chip away at the “No means no” defence, which is perhaps one of the most useful anti-rape rulings out there.\r\n\r\nObviously if you’re going to walk in a dangerous neighbourhood wearing a mini-mini and itty bitty tank is a bad idea. On the other hand the less then smart person who wears his gold watch in the wrong setting is as much asking for it as the near naked woman.\r\n\r\nBy putting the burden of rape on the potential rapist, it gives women freedom not to swathe themselves to veils and remain escorted by male relatives at all times. Extreme,  perhaps, but I say this just observing the historical progression from chattel to person of the female gender. If rape is about reproduction one must remember that controlling your own reproduction is one of the cornerstones of female equality.\r\n\r\nFinally, sex appeal is relative. The ugliest woman in a bikini may find no takers but a lovely girl in a chador may have to fight off men with a stick. In the long run ‘dress modest!’ advocates unreasonable conformity and artificial ugliness.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167360606,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cwbhq","parent_id":"t1_cwbae","author_flair_text":null,"author":"Phia","retrieved_on":1473809585,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56123-77af2510-d91c-43bc-88b9-8f06509df056-1566236779"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Not necessarily true... I'm a dual citizen of New Zealand and the UK, living in America.  I pay only tax in the US.  I haven't lived in the UK since I was a child, so I never paid tax there and don't even know what the laws pertaining to it are, but in New Zealand I filled out paperwork with the IRD (Inland Revenue Department) to qualify as a Non-Resident for Tax Purposes (this involved stating I had no financial ties with NZ such as a NZ bank account, real estate holdings etc).  So I don't have to pay any tax in NZ at all.  I believe that IF i did have financial ties, the NZ IRD would still only tax me on the income earned from the NZ holdings, not my American income - but I could be wrong about that, since I'm not a tax lawyer in either country. :)","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v69d","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166465483,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":6,"ups":6,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rraaarr","parent_id":"t1_cv6sn","id":"cv8ub","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808847,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36318-a408ee98-7d7e-4659-af7b-81a829e492f4-1566236772"}

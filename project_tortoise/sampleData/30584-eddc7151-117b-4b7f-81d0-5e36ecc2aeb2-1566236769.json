Programmers often don't see the tree in the forest.  Converting programming languages is expensive, even if the new language promises to make things \"better for the future\".  Costs often ignored:\r\n\r\n1.  Training.\r\n\r\n2.  Re-coding existing, working systems\r\n\r\n3.  Current development, that could be months in, is now lost?\r\n\r\n4.  Integration with existing systems.  This is a tough one since you not only are replacing existing, running systems (2) but also have to integrate with current systems until they too can be converted.\r\n\r\nStartups often use the \"better\" languages because they usually don't have all the overhead I just mentioned.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uu7k","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30584-eddc7151-117b-4b7f-81d0-5e36ecc2aeb2-1566236769"}

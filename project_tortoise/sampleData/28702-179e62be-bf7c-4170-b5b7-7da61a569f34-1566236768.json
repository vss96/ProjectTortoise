In so many previous cases, when novel or exotic species are introduced to an bioregion, there is a great chance for ecological damage, or at least long-term repercussions.\r\n\r\nZebra mussels in the Great Lakes.  Frogs in Australia.  Asian ladybugs and gypsy moths in the US.  Kudzu in the US south.  Hydrilla in US Eastern seaboard waterways. Asian [snakehead fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channidae) in North America.\r\n\r\nMany of the crops we grow have wild relatives that are considered to be weeds.  Some plant species even exhibit the ability to acquire genetic traits from exposure to the pollen of unrelated species.\r\n\r\nAmericans largely don't know about how widespread GMO crops are because the Ag companies that produce them have worked hard to keep information about them out of the news.","controversiality":1,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28702-179e62be-bf7c-4170-b5b7-7da61a569f34-1566236768"}

Thursday, he asks me and my coworker (we're both web developers) if we'd like to go out to lunch. I've been pretty good about not eating out so often, so I said what the hell. We go to lunch.\r\n\r\nLots of subjects are brought up. I try to stay out of most of them. Finally, \"peace\" itself is mentioned. For him, it's a simple concept, that of \"a single power having monopoly on violence\". I point out how Orwellian this definition is. How useless it is to describe anything worth trying to attain. But of course, he goes on the defensive, why is my definition any better than his? What makes me the supreme authority on the meanings of words?\r\n\r\nI gave up at this point. Remaining unspoken: our words and the meanings we find in them color our personality and soul. And among all the words that we might use, \"peace\" might be one of the most important. To have such a negative, even nilhilistic perspective on the concept invites all sorts of callousness into who you are. My own definition? Me the atheist? Something that sounds maybe a little like what maybe Jesus might have said, supposing he ever existed and was anything like what some say. \r\n\r\n*Peace is what we would have if we all learned to love one another and be good to each other, if we ever treated everyone as if they were our brothers and sisters. It's not the absence of violence through chance or circumstance or someone enforcing it at the end of a gun barrel, but its absence from our hearts and minds entirely, making the hurt of our fellow man unthinkable.*\r\n\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809751,"gilded":0,"id":"cwkdo","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_wkal","author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60543-81ed5cfb-d56b-4723-a2cb-b5811dbab128-1566236780"}

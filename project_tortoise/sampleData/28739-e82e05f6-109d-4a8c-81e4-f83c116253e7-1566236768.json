This gets voted up. Have you even read my comment?\r\n\r\nYes. Why, do you think I am responsible for your comment getting voted down? \r\n\r\nThe point I'd like to make is that those two particular bottlenecks can nearly always be avoided in practice by keeping data in local variables and inlining code. This is a  simple and very generally applicable optimization strategy. The result of writing code this way is rarely pretty -- I'd rather have the interpreter optimize automatically (Psyco does) -- but it's an option when you want the code to go faster.","created_utc":1166127067,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":2,"score":2,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28739-e82e05f6-109d-4a8c-81e4-f83c116253e7-1566236768"}

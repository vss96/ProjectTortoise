I'm finding that I have to dig much more on my own and add all sorts of crazy filters to get to the certain things I want.  It's not unbearable, but it's gotten worse.  If I run into a wall with Google, sometimes Yahoo comes through.  That said, I still predominantly use Google and even wade through pages of Google results before even thinking to try an alternative.\r\n\r\nSo I agree with the article that Google might not \"get\" websites (and searchers!) like they used to.  My major issue is that he purports his article is about Google setting a record-breaking loss and only uses that as cheap bait to make an argument that, really, isn't that revolutionary.\r\n\r\nAnd now I can see that the article is almost certainly self-submitted which, while not necessarily a bad thing -- good content is good content--, combined with the completely deceptive headline, makes me think this submission is more about spam (boosting that very PageRank that Google's spurned you on) than content.","retrieved_on":1473807721,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"ctkss","parent_id":"t1_ctkrl","author":"duketime","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6951-6cc05c17-8896-4cc6-993b-568f09d68b96-1566236760"}

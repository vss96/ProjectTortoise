Maybe the people who are better at mathematics are those who pursue more mathematically intensive careers. But this strategy raises two problems. First, which mathematically intensive jobs should we choose? If we choose engineering, we will conclude that men are better at math because more men become engineers. If we choose accounting, we will think that women are better at math because more women become accountants: 57% of current accountants are women. So which job are we going to pick, to decide who has more mathematical talent? \r\n\r\nThis is so stupid - accounting requires knowledge of how to use Microsoft Excel and how to add numbers. Period. \r\n\r\nEngineering requires skills that include spatial skills, differential equations, computer programming , drawing , working with hands - carpentry, electronics ... the list goes on. She really doesn't seem to know what goes into being an \"Engineer\" if she is going to make that comparison. Besides, Pinker mentions that women on average are better at calculation. Calculation (i.e adding up numbers ) is only a small fraction of the work you do as an engineer. It's the last step in solving any problem. Calculation is not Mathematics.\r\n\r\nAgain, I completely understand distributions and variances and the fact that one can't discriminate on this basis. But truth has no gender bias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t62k","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165004802,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2030-8a617de1-edb5-48b9-ab71-4e4a7660dfa7-1566236758"}

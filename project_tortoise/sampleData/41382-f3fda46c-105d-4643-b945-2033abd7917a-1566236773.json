{"body":"\"Do you just choose to ignore that stuff wholesale\"\r\n\r\nWe don't ignore it at all. Instead we just try to take it for what it is: advice from someone who was influential, but far from perfect. It is important to note that there is no section of the Bible labled \"Word of God\". It is written by humans and subject to their mistakes.\r\n\r\nNow, as I wrote before, there are fringe groups that try to take the whole thing as descended gospel, but they really just don't know what they are talking about.\r\n\r\nGetting back to Paul: the section you mention is actually a great example of people taking things out of context. He wasn't saying that it is a sin for slaves to disrespect their masters. He was giving advice on the most effective way to evangelize, and the conclusion he drew was that you have to stay in peoples' comfort zone. Unfortunately at that time, this meant slaves had to act subserviently.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Fixed misplaced apostrophe.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_vat3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166639633,"score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"procrastitron","parent_id":"t1_cvha9","edited":false,"id":"cviti","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809039,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"41382-f3fda46c-105d-4643-b945-2033abd7917a-1566236773"}

If you do, there's a good chance that the attacker is going to start attacking you.  And the last thing you want is for someone who is already attacking you to start attacking you.\r\n\r\nThe best course of action is to lay down, curl in the fetal position, and offer up your fresh juicy asshole to the them.    You should also apologize for not cleaning it well enough for their liking.  \r\n\r\nAnd while you may be bleeding from the rectum now, at least you didn't MAKE HULK ANGRY by attempting to fight back.  If you DO insist on defending yourself in some way, do so in a non-threatening manner.  Pretend you're a bare-knuckled boxer from the 20's and with an Irish accept say \"Put up your dukes\".  When you get a shot in, be sure to step back and let them regain their composure before continuing with the fight. \r\n\r\nThat's the way real men fight.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473809120,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cvn0f","parent_id":"t1_cvlik","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43378-9c085fc2-01cb-4fb2-8add-3464ca5754ca-1566236774"}

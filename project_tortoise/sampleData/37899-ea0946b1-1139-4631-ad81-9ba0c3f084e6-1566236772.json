However, that is not the reality of religion.  Religions have cultures, histories and customs as well as their beliefs.  Beyond this, all of these are interwoven as they affect and bend each other.  So there is much more that is going on than a simple logical syllogism.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I reject that your conclusion falls from your premises.  First, the torah is made up of largely stories, not direct commands, and are up to interpretation: in fact it is not always clear who is the hero, or if there even is a hero.  Second, a god that you describe would be able to see how people would respond to his words and choose them accordingly.  Your described god knew the words people would reject before he made them so it seems reasonable this was his intended consequence.  Think of it like playing pool where you can see exactly where the balls will end up before you hit the ball.  If you wanted the eight ball to not be so close to the side pocket after your shot you would have adjusted how you hit the cue ball in the first place.\r\n\r\nBut all of that aside, I even reject your premises.  Neither the torah, koran, nor christian bible seems to describe a god outside of time.  He seems to be constantly having to clean up mistakes that he hadn't predicted.  Sometimes he says he's going to do something and then later changes his mind (this is one of the main points of the tale of Jonah when god spares Nineveh).","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"37899-ea0946b1-1139-4631-ad81-9ba0c3f084e6-1566236772"}

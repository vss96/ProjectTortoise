Do you like twisting words?\r\n\r\nA \"means\" is a method of accomplishing something. The 9-11 attackers hijacked planes and piloted them into skyscrapers. The means was hijacking and kamikaze'ing.\r\n\r\nReligion could only be a means if they prayed to Allah, and He willed the jets into the buildings.\r\n\r\nI think you mean the \"motivations\" were religion. Except, that doesn't quite work either, since they weren't wholly religious (or in some cases at all religious).\r\n\r\nYou're as deluded as one of those white supremacists that insists that whenever a black person murders someone that it's because he's black. Except your boogeyman is religion. You can't be persuaded to think about anything, you just yap and yap and yap... and just like the WS nutjob, your solution is to eradicate the \"problem\".\r\n","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vx8t","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167015262,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49323-cd6eae8b-0623-42e1-9e07-6e4e1338aee6-1566236777"}

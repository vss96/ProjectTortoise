If you want to argue about something webmail-like, fine.  Your statements are not fully compatible there either.\r\n\r\nI'll use the example you gave about moving emails.  I have tried, in the past, to use the same script for ajax and for non-Javascript functionality - in your example this script is /move-email.  The problem I ran into has to do with the redirection - when the script is used ajax-style, it still follows the redirect, which makes it impossible for you to return anything helpful (like a success indicator) without relying on a conditional that tells you whether this is an ajax request or not.  That's easy enough to fix for a simple example like this, but for a complicated enough application, you'll end up adding conditionals for this, conditionals for that, until you end up having what amounts to two different versions of the application, all packed into the same scripts.  It's a headache I prefer to avoid.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165338514,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9276-93bc8dfa-c747-4bb5-8a38-8cd302e16f61-1566236761"}

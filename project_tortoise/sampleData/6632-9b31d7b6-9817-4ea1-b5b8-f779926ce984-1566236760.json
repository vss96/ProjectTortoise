I once had to loan a friend a pair of boxers, because his girlfriend was the same and it landed him in a 'I have to get changed in public, I'm not going commando, it's *cold*' situation. Last I saw of those boxers, the last I heard was that she had them. It's not that I'd ever have worn them again, but it's the principle and you don't steal your boyfriends *friends* skivvies, it's an unholy sin amongst calling Mary a fat whore who did half of the barnyard animals.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_thva","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807708,"distinguished":null,"author":"electromagnetic","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_ctk1c","id":"ctk3p","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"6632-9b31d7b6-9817-4ea1-b5b8-f779926ce984-1566236760"}

I still have one for Google that blinks tiny colored LEDs in sequence.\r\n\r\nI don't have a pacemaker, but I can tell you that I **did** wear that thing pretty much right over my heart for about an hour after I picked it up at Google's booth.  I've seen other tchotchkes that have NiBs.  One booth was giving out glowing necklaces with LEDs lighting up a lucite medallion, and the on/off switch was the clasp that held together with a pair of NiBs.\r\n\r\nI have a friend who actually mashed a fingernail playing with larger NiBs (salvaged from dead several-year-old hard drives). He had to have it removed to get it to grow back properly.  A pair of those things can really [accelerate](http://www.grand-illusions.com/toyshop/gaussian_gun/) when they get too close.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_t7gw","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1164988500,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1326-858f5cee-52ee-4a5f-8082-c502c127a0e4-1566236758"}

The danger here is PHP itself, because it uses an extremely exploitable API for database access and web I/O in general.\r\n\r\nIt's generally considered a better approach to execute your queries like 'query(\"insert into %s values (%s, %s, %s)\", tablename, value1, value2, value3)' and let the DB library take care of any necessary data mangling.  But PHP puts all that work on the user, who might not know about the problem, or might not know enough about the problem to work around it effectively.  You can't expect every developer to both be informed about every problem, and be an expert on every workaround.\r\n\r\nThat's only one example though.  Using PHP without escaping data is asking for trouble, but mainly because using PHP at all is asking for trouble.\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46751-22951fdb-3b6b-4771-99da-99594fd77b3d-1566236775"}

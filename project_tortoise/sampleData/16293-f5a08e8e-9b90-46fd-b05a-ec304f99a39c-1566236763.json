He paid a few hundred bucks for the machine and will probably pay another few hundred bucks a few years from now for a replacement.  He pays about $20/month for broadband Net access, or maybe he has some cable-TV package where his cable provider throws in Net access along with a bunch of other goodies.\r\n\r\nNow you want to sell this guy on an application service provider for, umm, everything.  What's in it for Joe?  He'll still have to pay for Net access and a machine to connect to it.  An application that can crash on a desktop machine, or an OS that is vulnerable to viruses on a desktop machine, will be just as vulnerable running on a server farm.  And conversely: anything that can be done at a server farm to make those machines harder to crash, easier to upgrade, etc., can be done just as well at the desktop level.\r\n\r\nThe ASP will have to charge enough to keep their service running close to 24/7.  I pay OpenHosting about $20/month for their cheapest level of service, and all that gets me is a virtual Linux box with a static IP address and automatic backups; I have to do all my own system administration.\r\n\r\nSo any ASP that provides general-purpose \"service computers\" is either going to provide such a restricted service that no consumers would be interested, or charge such a high subscription fee that no consumers would be interested.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u3cv","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16293-f5a08e8e-9b90-46fd-b05a-ec304f99a39c-1566236763"}

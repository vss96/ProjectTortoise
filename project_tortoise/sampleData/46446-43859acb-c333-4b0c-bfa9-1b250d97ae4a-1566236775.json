The syntax of object calls is almost lisp-like. You have to split up the interface and methods of an object. It's as type-unsafe as C, but lots slower. Call recipients are resolved at runtime. It basically *is* C syntactically, except that the object syntax is utterly unlike C (or anything else). You refcount objects, and use a runloop-deferred refcount to pass them around with primitive automatic garbage collection. There's no real privacy and strangers can patch your objects with \"categories\" even after they're compiled and shipped.\r\n\r\nNot that any of the above is entirely without merit. But, it's basically a conceptual path that the mainstream didn't travel, and so the un-coached reaction of Joe Java is panic.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166830460,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46446-43859acb-c333-4b0c-bfa9-1b250d97ae4a-1566236775"}

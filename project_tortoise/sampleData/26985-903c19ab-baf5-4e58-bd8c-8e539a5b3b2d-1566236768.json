God is not a thing in that sense, and is not within the domain of what science investigates any more than science can investigate justice, beauty, or numbers (math is not science).  The scientific experiment requires some kind of controlled experiment over the subject to investigate.  God as understood by every theology I am aware of is not such that a scientific experiment could be possible, for if it were, that would mean that in some sense humans were more powerful or better than God.  The scientific experiment requires something quantifiable to use as data.  God is not understood as quantifiable in any theology I am aware of, the closest thing would be referring to God as the One, or as a Trinity, neither of which are really a basis for an experiment.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_une1","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"26985-903c19ab-baf5-4e58-bd8c-8e539a5b3b2d-1566236768"}

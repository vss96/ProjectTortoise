At first you're trying to just hit the damn thing without falling down or hurting yourself.  Once you've got the hang of that you try to hit it, you know, in the actual air.  Next you may try to hit a draw or a fade (on purpose instead of randomly) or hit it farther.  As you get better you practice different things.  Nobody sane practices exactly the same thing over and over and over again.  That's for the monkeys.\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vmcm","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809154,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"khayber","id":"cvopr","parent_id":"t1_cvo1j","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44368-c3822530-c161-4e63-868c-7e7ee5a6d7bc-1566236774"}

Autistic people are afflicted with low empathy. [Magical thinkers](http://www.davidbrin.com/tolkienarticle1.html) are afflicted with low rationality.\r\n\r\nNow it gets really speculative. I conceive of rationality as sustained consistency. I *cannot* conceive of any remotely functioning human being who lacks both empathy and rationality. Hence, autistic people, the ones who haven't gone catatonic anyways, lacking empathy, must have rationality. Which is sustained consistency.\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate if you could give me a short explanation of the state of the art in such genetic research. Are there gene chips? Is the research effort organized or entirely chaotic? Things of that nature.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25475-c9e6002d-835f-489b-988c-cdb939212fa7-1566236767"}

Soviet-style Communism may not work so well in peacetime, but it did an excellent job of converting potential war output into actual war output.  The Germans got rid of most of the redundant equipment, inefficient contractors, and made people like domestic servants work in the war industry.\r\n\r\nThe figures you link showed that it worked.  By 1944, the Germans had almost caught up to the Russians in tank and aircraft production.  This was while they were being heavily bombed by the Allies, and with a blockade that deprived them of critical war material.  \r\n\r\nWithout the bombing raids, the figures would have been higher, and it all would have been directed at the Soviets. Looking at the figures for aircraft, I doubt the Soviets would have ever achieved air superiority. Without the blockade, they could have used those Jewish dental fillings to buy critical materials.  Also, the sharp decline in oil production which crippled them in 1944 would not have happened, because they could have held on to Romania longer and the coal-&gt;oil facilities were destroyed by American bombers.\r\n\r\nI don't believe that the Russians were ever close to cracking, or that capturing Moscow or Stalingrad would have changed anything, but the Germans might have been able to turn the tide later in the war if the Allies hadn't been involved.  It would have been a very long, exhausting war, and it might have come down to which side ran out of cannon fodder first.  Or there might have been peace without a clear victory on either side.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166366996,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cv401","parent_id":"t1_cv3nn","author":"lysine23","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808755,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"33853-0230b7e3-b0e7-4db3-833e-c7d3b19be6eb-1566236771"}

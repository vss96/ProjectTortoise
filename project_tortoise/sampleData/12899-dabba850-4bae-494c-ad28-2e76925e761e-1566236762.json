Then he could have made a huge bonfire every day to help people locate him and keep his family warm. He could have tried his hand at setting up some rabbit traps in the hopes of an easy meal as well. Perhaps if he learned the edible plants of his home area in the past few years, he would have found some edible bark or edible roots.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line? Our civilization does not teach people how to live outside of civilization. He decided to go with that flow and not learn how to survive without civilization's help. Hence he died when he got stuck outside its sphere of influence. So to me, it is both very sad he died and very sad he didn't use some of his time learning how to properly protect his family and himself because of his belief that civilization would always save him.\r\n\r\nThe only thing left for us now is to learn the lesson that he paid his life to learn. My condolences to his friends and family. I was really hoping to hear a good outcome when I learned he went missing. It is a sad day indeed.","link_id":"t3_tvxs","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165454535,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"12899-dabba850-4bae-494c-ad28-2e76925e761e-1566236762"}

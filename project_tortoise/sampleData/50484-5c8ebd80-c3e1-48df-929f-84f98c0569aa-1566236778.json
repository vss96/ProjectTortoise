NO. blah, blah.\r\n\r\nYou left out some very important stuff in your blah blah blahs.  AFAIK you can't link C object files between gcc and VC either.  Using DLLs is no problem.  I don't program in Windows much anymore; when I did I used VC++.  On linux there is no problem with linking.\r\n\r\n&gt;C++ is what it is because it always chose evolution and compatibility.\r\n\r\nYup.  And D didn't.  When I need compatibility I can still use C/C++.\r\n\r\n&gt;What, did they write this before boost and STL?\r\n\r\nMy only reply is that you are talking about things in the runtime library (or add-ons).  For many cases this is not the same as being part of the language (meaning not as powerful).\r\n\r\nAnyway, you are free to choose whichever is _your_ favorite language.\r\n\r\n[Edit: formatting]","retrieved_on":1473809384,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cw0ub","parent_id":"t1_cw0rg","author_flair_text":null,"author":"khayber","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50484-5c8ebd80-c3e1-48df-929f-84f98c0569aa-1566236778"}

No matter how good your regex-foo, if someone throws a pathological case at you, your program will break.\r\n\r\nThe perl approach seems fairly sensible here - getting rid of program-breaking behaviour a case that could well be likely in some situations in exchange for a more general slowdown.  After all, the whole point of regexes is that they are a _general_ tool for matching text.  When you need real performance, and know more about the format of your input, you're better off writing a custom parser.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uf2g","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808384,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Brian","parent_id":"t1_cug99","edited":false,"id":"cuk67","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24614-47923358-f7da-44b9-bd14-a9592a459d98-1566236767"}

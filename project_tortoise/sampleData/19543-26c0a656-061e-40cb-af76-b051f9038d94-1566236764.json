Suppose France invaded. Or Russia, or China. It's not so hard to imagine their governments acting not for their people, but rather internal centers of power.\r\n\r\nWhy? Something to do with controlling prices and access to oil.\r\n\r\nOther people do not have such intense illusions about the US government that its inhibitants do. They observe that we lock up our own citizens at the [highest rate in the world](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/rel/icps/world-prison-population-list-2005.pdf), and spend about as much on military as the rest of the world combined. They know some history of previous empires. And they're not quite as exposed to the [propaganda](http://www.pentaside.org/article/propaganda-bernays-1928.html).\r\n\r\nNation-states naturally attack each other; something weird's going when they don't for a long while.

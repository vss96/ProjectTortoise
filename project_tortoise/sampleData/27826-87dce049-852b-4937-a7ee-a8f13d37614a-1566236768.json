We are at our wits end at the moment as this pervert has been back at the stables again. The cameras have been broken so we havent been able to capture him on the CCTV. The police arent doing anything, can anyone suggest what we can do? He was back on Saturday evening/Sunday morning and was after the 6month old foal we have there, he had let her out of her stable and re-arranged her buckets etc so he could stand on them to get up behind her, we know its him again!! Please can someone give us some help, we are just 4 woman along at the stables and feel helpless.  He lives at 58 Goathland Avenue in Longbenton, Newcastle Upon Tyne.  \r\nAny comments/help appreciated!\r\nThanks x","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ur6g","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":1,"score":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166097380,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27826-87dce049-852b-4937-a7ee-a8f13d37614a-1566236768"}

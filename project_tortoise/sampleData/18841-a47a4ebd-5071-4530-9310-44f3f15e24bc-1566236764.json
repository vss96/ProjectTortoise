Two were standard-issue American high schools, and two were American boarding schools in Rome (with American students being the minority).\r\n\r\nThe typical American high schools were full of vicious cliques.\r\n\r\nThe boarding schools had cliques, but for the most part they weren't competetive or hostile. There was a bit more perspective.\r\n\r\nThe students at the boarding schools were treated more like adults, while the students at American high schools are treated as errant children, processed like meat. (How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?!)\r\n\r\nIt creates a toxic atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAmerican high schools have a feeling of being hermetically sealed from the outside world. Petty dramas take on an echo-chamber effect.","link_id":"t3_u2bi","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808180,"distinguished":null,"author":"Nailati","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cu9ci","parent_id":"t1_cu3wm","timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18841-a47a4ebd-5071-4530-9310-44f3f15e24bc-1566236764"}

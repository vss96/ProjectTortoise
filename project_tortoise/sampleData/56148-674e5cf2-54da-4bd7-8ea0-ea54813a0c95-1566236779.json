If you think they are wrong, say so.\r\n\r\nWell, some of those numbers *do* come from the Bible. I guess they *have* to be right.\r\n\r\nThe numbers don't even measure the same things (age of Earth vs. age of Universe) and they don't demonstrate anything close to the kind of range of variation you're claiming (only about one order of magnitude in the age of the universe estimates). Even if the numbers are all perfectly accurate (in a historical sense), they don't support your case. \r\n\r\nThe fact that the paper is a joke is relevant. The numbers were assembled the way they were *because* doing so doesn't make any sense. *The chart is part of the joke*. Was \"Who's On First\" right or wrong?\r\n\r\n&gt;The speed of light is not a serious example?\r\n\r\nHave estimates of the speed of light been adjusted by *a factor of 460,000x*, and I just never heard of it? Did we once suppose that light only travelled 2,000 *feet* per second -- about twice the speed of sound?\r\n\r\n&gt;The stability of an electron is not a serious example?\r\n\r\nSuppose Mr. A believes the red-headed woodpecker mates for life and likes to nest in ancient oak trees. Suppose Mr. B disagrees, and says they mate only for a single season and they nest in any old place.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to even ask \"What is the mathematical magnitude of difference between these theories?\"\r\n\r\nThe difference between \"electrons have no (i.e., an infinite) half-life\" and \"electrons have a half-life of X\" isn't a quantitative one. It's not an example of a measurement getting adjusted by some factor.\r\n\r\nThere are times when the sheer size of a mismatch in calculations makes responsible people scratch their head and double-check. Creationism's 6,000-year-old-Earth estimate probably is one of those times. That's really all the point is here.","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1167362359,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"56148-674e5cf2-54da-4bd7-8ea0-ea54813a0c95-1566236779"}

Savage means not civilized and civilized means that you have cities. So if you're talking in a historical context then the ancient Babylonians were civilized but the Amerinds were savages. And they were.\r\n\r\nBut there are other meanings of savage. In the colonial era, savage meant illiterate. So if you were illiterate then you were savage. So the Irish were kilt-wearing savages. And the Indians were sari-wearing savages.\r\n\r\nNowadays, savage just means culturally backwards. This is determined by [childrearing modes](http://www.empathicparenting.org/modes.htm). See also this [handy chart of their history](http://www.empathicparenting.org/psychopathy/modes.htm). Savage would be about two modes behind your own society. So for example, depending on your society, that would be the African interior, or all of Africa.\r\n\r\nAs for who's not backwards? Western Europe is sortof okay, as is Canada. Modern Germany is okay. Eastern Europe is backwards. Northern Europe is at the forefront of civilization.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809188,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvq0o","id":"cvqhv","author":"richardkulisz","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45205-b0ffda53-691e-4ebd-9c76-6e072099dec4-1566236774"}

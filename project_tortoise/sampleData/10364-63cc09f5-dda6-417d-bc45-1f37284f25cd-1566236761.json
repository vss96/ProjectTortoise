Mercantilism, which is the most common economic system today, is where the government sells power to large companies.  These companies buy government power in order to protect themselves from competition.  It's common to mistake mercantilism for capitalism, especially because lawmakers encourage this misconception in order to gain power.\r\n\r\nLeftists hate big corporations, but they like the big government that gives protection to the big corporations.  This is because they tend to imagine how they would run the government instead of looking at how it operates in reality.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, any regulation that could in theory be used to protect the powerless from the powerful, will instead be used by the powerful to step on the powerless.  And if they're good, the powerful will convince most people that they don't like the regulation.\r\n\r\nThis is why anarcho-capitalism is different from the mercantilist systems in place today, with all the protectionism and subsidies and startup-killing regulations and regressive taxes and whatnot.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807852,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_ctrn6","id":"ctrup","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"asokoloski","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10364-63cc09f5-dda6-417d-bc45-1f37284f25cd-1566236761"}

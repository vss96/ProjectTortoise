Off the top of my head, there'd probably be great advances in materials science, closed systems life support, propulsion technology  and I'm sure I'm missing tons of others.\r\n\r\nSo what are these technologies good for?\r\nLighter and stronger materials mean lighter, stronger automobiles, airplanes and buildings. This means safer and more fuel efficient automobiles and airplanes, and taller more wind/earthquake resistant buildings.\r\n\r\nClosed systems would mean healthier buildings, more efficient desalinization, bases on the sea floor, better resource recycling, and better hydroponic farming technology.\r\n\r\nPropulsion technology means cheaper transport and greater mobility for humanity, among others.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u5vc","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17882-98136173-fda1-4b6a-b99c-c641aa99af5a-1566236763"}

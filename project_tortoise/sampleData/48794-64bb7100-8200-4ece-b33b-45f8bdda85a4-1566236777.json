He was a physicist put out of work by the Cultural Revolution, and while he was working as a tour guide in Huangshan he started taking photos. It’s some of the best landscape photography I’ve ever seen.\r\n\r\n*** Strictly, shan shui is a kind of painting that meets some fairly narrow rules about composition, but in practice it seems to mean a romantic depiction of misty karst. I’m told 山水 is literally “mountain, water”.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vwtm","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48794-64bb7100-8200-4ece-b33b-45f8bdda85a4-1566236777"}

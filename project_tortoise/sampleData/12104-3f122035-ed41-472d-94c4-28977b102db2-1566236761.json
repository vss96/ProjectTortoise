I noticed that once the fire started a few intelligent people (including the cameraman) realized the situation was already dangerous.\r\n\r\nI was at a small nightclub in Wildwood New Jersey on July 4th in the 1980's. My friend and I went to see a band (Dead End Kids) perform. We had seen them many other times but this was the first where they had installed pyrotechnics. \r\n\r\nWhen those went off (similar to the ones Great White had) the tarpaulin  above the drummer caught fire. No one realized it since the flames were going upward, but when hot plastic was dripping down on the drummer, that's when the music stopped and a roadie quickly extinguished it. For a moment though the whole crowd was in a dumb panic. Including my friend and I, we were all the way in the back of the crowded club. If that fire raged out of control I don't think I'd be typing this right now.\r\n\r\nSince then I've gotten wiser. Don't go to a small club if the band needs to set off pyrotechnics. If you do make sure you know the fire exits and other means of escape. Because many clubs look the other way when it comes to safety.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts will go out to the victims and their family of this tragedy every time I go into a club.\r\n\r\nTake heed indeed.","controversiality":0,"ups":12,"score":12,"created_utc":1165433167,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctvi2","parent_id":"t3_ttys","author":"artman","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807921,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"12104-3f122035-ed41-472d-94c4-28977b102db2-1566236761"}

{"body":"Richard Dawkins says:\r\n\r\n\"The Second Law states that, in a closed system without external energy fed in from outside, entropy always increases.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that is just plain wrong, especially the bit that says \"always\". More correct is:\r\n\r\n\"The Second Law states that, in a closed system without external energy fed in from outside, entropy 'almost' never decreases by a 'large' amount.\"\r\n\r\nFor further details, Richard Dawkins should read my article \"The Second Law of Thermodynamics Does Not Prohibit a Decrease of Entropy in a Closed System\" at http://www.1729.com/blog/SecondLawDoesntProhibitEntropyDecrease.html (previously featured on Reddit).","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vuol","subreddit":"science","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1166944107,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_vuol","id":"cvwfw","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809300,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48274-dd3859c7-e0aa-4c1e-bbcc-0746f1b643bf-1566236777"}

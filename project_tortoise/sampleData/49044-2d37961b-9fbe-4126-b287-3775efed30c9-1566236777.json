And he is a better public speaker than you are.\r\n\r\nKeep that in mind.\r\n\r\nLet's fall back to logic for a moment. If you're concerned about rape and murder, and you are trying to persuade people to disown religion, then it follows that you believe that one somehow causes the other directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\nIf however, you concede that these two problems will neither be reduced or eliminated once people disown religion, well, at that point it tells me that you were never really concerned with those two crimes.\r\n\r\nYou were twisting words to advance your own agenda. An agenda which you have readily admitted to be \"the biggest problem in the world\" as you see it. Even bigger than people losing their lives through murder and war.\r\n\r\nWhat part of this will you deny? I'm not being argumentative, I'm trying to prove a point which is very important.","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49044-2d37961b-9fbe-4126-b287-3775efed30c9-1566236777"}

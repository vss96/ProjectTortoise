What I meant was idiomatic language (parlance), not idioms like \"kick the bucket\".  In fact one of the nice properties of statistical translation is that you don't have to handle idioms separately.\r\n\r\nWhen you modify an idiom, you get something that is rather unlikely to occur.  For example, I presume *kick the green bucket* is very improbable (except in literature on idioms) whereas modifications of other collocations are not so unlikely.  If *spill* and *beans* co-occur, then it's very likely that they do exactly as *spill the beans*  whereas *thought* and *was* co-occur in a variety of ways. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"19942-9dac5fc3-59c3-43ee-8c22-fc0ebae9723f-1566236764"}

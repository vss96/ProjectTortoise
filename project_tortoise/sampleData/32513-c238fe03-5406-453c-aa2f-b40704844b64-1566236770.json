Paintballs are like 50 times heavier than an air rifle pellet.  That's why they're somewhat dangerous at 500 FPS while air rifles mainly just hurt like hell (not counting the eye risk).\r\n\r\nAs an absurd example, compare a pellet gun at, say, 500 FPS (being generous here) vs a car going 80 FPS (~60 MPH).  Which one do you want to get hit with?  How about a motorcycle going 160 FPS vs that same care (a similar weight ratio to the paintball example)?  Just think about it man.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uvo6","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808705,"distinguished":null,"author":"zhyla","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cuzpd","id":"cv1b8","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32513-c238fe03-5406-453c-aa2f-b40704844b64-1566236770"}

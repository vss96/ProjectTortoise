But we're talking about something like $10K, not $250K.\r\n\r\nHowever, that's not the issue here, the issue is whether or not it's a good risk on the lender's part.  Lending someone in college working partime ~$250K seems like folly.  The assumption in a situation like that is that the house will continue to appreciate at the same rate it did for the last few years.  If that rate of appreciation falls to 0 or slightly negative there's not likely to be a good outcome.","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36956-88750af6-32c6-4ef5-942b-564dff556cb5-1566236772"}

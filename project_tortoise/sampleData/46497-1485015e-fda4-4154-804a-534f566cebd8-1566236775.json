Most people in this country probably agree with you about corporate welfare being harmful and unfair -- why, then does it still exist?\r\n\r\nIt exists because we refuse to give up our cherished illusion of the state as our protector, as something that can be fixed if people would just stop behaving like people and start acting like selfless robots.\r\n\r\nPowerful corporations will never lose their power as long as we keep giving it to them through the state.  Every tax dollar you pay is another dollar that a lobbyist can grab.\r\n\r\nStop believing politicians.  If you want to give to the poor, do your research and find a trustworthy charity.  Otherwise, don't complain when your tax dollars go to a CEO instead of a needy single mother.  If you give your money to someone with a track record of irresponsibility and they waste it, it's your fault.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809232,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvs5i","id":"cvsu7","author":"asokoloski","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46497-1485015e-fda4-4154-804a-534f566cebd8-1566236775"}

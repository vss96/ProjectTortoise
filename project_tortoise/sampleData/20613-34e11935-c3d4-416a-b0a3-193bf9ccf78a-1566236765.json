In other words, wherever power is concentrated (ie, currently the government), it makes sense to use influence and money to make that concentration of power adjust circumstances to your favor.  This is true whether the power concentration is a government, a feudal lord, the church, a mob boss, or a board of directors.  If you don't understand that this generalizes to any concentration of power, you run the risk of becoming a naive Libertarian who thinks if you just remove government, everything turns out rosy.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ubuw","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808241,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","edited":false,"id":"cucnj","parent_id":"t1_cucc4","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20613-34e11935-c3d4-416a-b0a3-193bf9ccf78a-1566236765"}

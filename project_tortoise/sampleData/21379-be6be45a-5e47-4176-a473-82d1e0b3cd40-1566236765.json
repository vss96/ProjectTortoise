Torture is common in many, many parts of the world\r\n\r\n-I didn't say US prison torture was okay. The US gets shit thrown in its face by everyone in Europe on almost every occasion available. It is more \"shocking\" to show things in the US than even, say, the UK, home of the BBC.\r\n\r\n-America is held at a higher standard. This is true. The US doesn't ask for it though. It acts in its best interest, like every other country. It is ridiculous to pretend that the economic freedom that leads to greater wealth should also cause higher moral standing. Note that the US is capable of destroying the world many times over. It has done everything possible to avoid civilian deaths of its enemies. The same cannot be said of many, many nations: given the power, their current leadership would kill many, many more people than the US.\r\n\r\nBut writing in response, I really should catch myself. Debating on the internet is retarded. Everyone that participates is wasting their time.","score":-2,"ups":-2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165807694,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cudht","id":"cudyb","author_flair_text":null,"author":"IKbot","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808266,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21379-be6be45a-5e47-4176-a473-82d1e0b3cd40-1566236765"}

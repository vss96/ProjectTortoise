Bad economy breaks people. If the number of people who do not want or can not  play with old rules grows too big, economic break happens. \r\nThis is my intuition. \r\n\r\nUS is in bad shape economically, but its  effect to world economy is shrinking. Trade between Europe and East Asia is surpassing the trade they have with US. If US has really long and bad economic crisis, it will cause only temporary (but still bad) recession in the rest of the world. Economic collapse in US would probably just dramatically speed up the change that is already happening. \r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vc4j","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38212-e76c7954-6500-4b84-9a4a-c66b3a3e5862-1566236772"}

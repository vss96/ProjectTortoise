Practically, it's probably nearly worthless.  The problem is that 99.99% of the time, there's an easier/better way to debug, and it's simply not worth the time to learn a tool like this to cover the other 0.01%.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more importantly, to paraphrase someone wiser than me: *Once you've dropped into the debugger, you've lost.*\r\n\r\nThe point is that debugging is a complete time-suck, and you're much better off\r\n\r\n* not making the errors in the first place, and \r\n* using very light-weight instrumentation (e.g., print statements) to quickly cover most cases.  \r\n\r\nMy experience, at least, has borne this out.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w55v","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809483,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cw611","parent_id":"t3_w55v","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53296-571f46e7-0953-44d1-badd-d9853925da16-1566236778"}

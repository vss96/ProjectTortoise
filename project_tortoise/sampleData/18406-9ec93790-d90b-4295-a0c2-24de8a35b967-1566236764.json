I used to have a job writing HIV/Aids education materials for South African mine workers unions. Migrant workers come from all over Southern Africa and stay in cramped single sex hostels. They generally only go home to see their families once or twice a year, and these families are economically dependent on the money sent home by the miners.\r\n'Vice villages' spring up around mining camps (as well as at truck stops and border posts, where there are long delays), with brothels and taverns. There is no other entertainment and not much other way for the miners to deal with a stressful job.\r\nHIV prevalence in these areas is amongst the highest in the world - apparently 70% around the Hanover truck stop in central South Africa, though I don't have any sources to hand.","link_id":"t3_u6tj","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165675269,"ups":16,"score":16,"timestamp_epoch":1566236764,"message_id":"18406-9ec93790-d90b-4295-a0c2-24de8a35b967-1566236764"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt;What improvements do you expect from bytecode? Speed?\r\n\r\nYou can gain speed from using bytecode.  That's why so many languages compile to it.\r\n\r\n&gt;yet it is not universally faster (I think this is a common myth) than Ruby.\r\n\r\nUm, well, you are probably the first person I have ever heard who thinks Ruby is on par with Python in the performance field.  There are lots of benchmarks that show Ruby being considerably slower than Python.  Before coming up with your own tests, which people are shooting holes in, you might want to use one of the examples from the popular benchmark sites.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uqnu","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166114816,"author":"sbrown123","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cursi","id":"cus4v","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808531,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28228-a491811c-56e1-4e27-8b23-b01de4d4fd82-1566236768"}

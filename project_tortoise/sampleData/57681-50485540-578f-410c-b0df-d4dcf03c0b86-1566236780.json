They were friends, it was an accident, sometimes when you're bird hunting the dogs will scare up a covey or a bird and it/they will fly low and between two hunters.  Good hunters are always aware of their background and their other party members when tracking a target, as, by way of comparison, a Navy Seal team is when using teamwork to storm a building.  Cheney clearly isn't such a good hunter, but in this isolated incident, I think that's the extent of his crime.  If his friend didn't want to press charges, then that's all there was to it.\r\n\r\nBesides, if Cheney had wanted to accomplish anything other than a PR disaster, he would have had someone do his dirty work for him, he would have assured it would actually have killed the guy instead of just giving him some annoying scars, and he would have been far from the scene with alibis.  Does anyone seriously believe there was any malicious intent there?","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809642,"gilded":0,"id":"cwejo","parent_id":"t1_cwd8f","edited":false,"author":"fbg111","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"57681-50485540-578f-410c-b0df-d4dcf03c0b86-1566236780"}

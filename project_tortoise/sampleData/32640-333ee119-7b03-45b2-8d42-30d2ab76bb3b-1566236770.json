The statements \"You could be wrong\" and \"You have no reason to be right\" do not entail \"You are wrong.\"  \r\n\r\nFor example, consider the lottery (assume, for the sake of argument, that there's always a winning number, though many real lotteries don't have this property).  Millions of people have millions of different lottery numbers.  You have no reason to believe that your particular lottery number is the winning one.  In fact, odds are that it's incorrect.  However, *somewhere* out there, *someone* has the winning number.  You can't unequivocally tell them all \"You didn't win\", because in one case out of the million, you'll be wrong.\r\n\r\nSame phenomena comes up with startups.  People tell me \"90% of startups fail, so don't even bother to start one.  You have no reason to believe you'll be in the 10% that succeed.\"  This completely ignores the possible payoffs - if the average windfall to a founder is $10M, and 90% fail, that's an average expected payoff of $1M.  Not bad for a couple years of work.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32640-333ee119-7b03-45b2-8d42-30d2ab76bb3b-1566236770"}

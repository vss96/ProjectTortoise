Topologically this turns the complex plane into a sphere (the so-called Riemann sphere).  Many results of complex analysis are much easier to state on the Riemann sphere rather than the complex plane; for instance, the function 1/z sends 0 to \\infty, so it has the nice property of mapping the Riemann sphere to itself.  The augmented real line is then simply an equator of the sphere, and this is the most natural way of interpretting what the math teacher did.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the math teacher's 'achievement' is utterly trivial and unoriginal; however, all of these rants about 1/z simply being undefined are also misguided.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808046,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cu29a","parent_id":"t3_tzna","edited":false,"author":"ksetter","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15087-ee2c879c-0446-4cb4-a18a-10b11854b60b-1566236762"}

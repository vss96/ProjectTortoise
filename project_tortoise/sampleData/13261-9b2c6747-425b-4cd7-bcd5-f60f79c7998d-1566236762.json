Imagine a role-reversal here: he dislikes how his mom is behaving and so isolates her from everyone she knows and her entire life for two years. Just awful.\r\n\r\nSeriously, who is this woman to make decisions for him? She had her chance to influence his life and blew it. Kidnapping under the false pretense of a vacation and imprisonment for two years is not an acceptable way to deal with disagreements about one's child's behavior.\r\n\r\nChildren have no rights in this country.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_twhc","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807967,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"jkerwin","parent_id":"t3_twhc","id":"cty01","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13261-9b2c6747-425b-4cd7-bcd5-f60f79c7998d-1566236762"}

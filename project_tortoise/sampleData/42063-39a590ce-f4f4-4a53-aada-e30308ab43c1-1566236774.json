{"controversiality":0,"body":"Wow this is me.\r\n\r\nEdit: More:\r\nWell I got through uni, I was down and massively slack in second year uni, then I had a huge surge and worked manically to do 3rd year, and was up and down likewise in honours.  Almost through my PhD now.  Diagnosed with clinical depression second year, went through two up periods, the last one I finished a complete draft of my dissertation, while developing two lisp programs/prototypes. One for the PhD, one for my research job. (I also tutor Lisp at uni.)  I was drinking a little more to `make the maths stop'... the churning of thoughts in my head.\r\n\r\nBeen on a down for the last two months now, but maybe coming out of it. I guess I've learnt to ride my highs and just try to muddle through my lows... I'm grateful that my swings aren't too bad, and I try to be self aware so as to limit personal relationship damage.","link_id":"t3_vk0o","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166656975,"score":44,"ups":44,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"rukubites","parent_id":"t3_vk0o","id":"cvk3b","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809064,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"42063-39a590ce-f4f4-4a53-aada-e30308ab43c1-1566236774"}

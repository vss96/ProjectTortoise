{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; A classic example of the reductio ad absurdum fallacy\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with reductio ad absurdum arguments?  In mathematics they are used all the time: Hardy called them a far greater gambit than any you would find in chess.  See what [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) has to say:\r\n\r\n&gt;There is a fairly common misconception that reductio ad absurdum simply denotes \"a silly argument\" and is itself a logical fallacy. However, this is not correct; a properly constructed reductio constitutes a valid argument.\r\n\r\nThat said, tell me what is so scary about legalized polygamy, for instance.  It strikes me that the same arguments to support gay marriage could be equally valid for polygamy.  But rather than conclude the premise (that gay marriage should be legalized) is wrong, why not simply accept the supposed absurdity (polygamy).  It seems to me that the only objection against the practice is a moral one, and what business does government have in legislating morality?  (That said, perhaps you will say, Ah, but polygamy tends to be bad for women and leads to abuse.  But this doesnt' hold much weight, as the abuse seems to stem from the illegality of it, and so it goes underground; also, there are laws against abuse as it is.)","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_v4ak","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1166394037,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-4,"ups":-4,"author":"ghhardy","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cv5aj","parent_id":"t1_cv52a","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808779,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34551-f5ebaccb-ac02-4264-a9b3-ede1fdf672ff-1566236771"}

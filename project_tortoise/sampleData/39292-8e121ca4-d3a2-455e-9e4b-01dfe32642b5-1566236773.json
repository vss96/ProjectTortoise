Name one?\r\n\r\nWhat principle- please state it? That the Vice-President can do what he wants, when he wants by virtue of holding the office? \r\n\r\nThe vice-president is an elected official who is restrained by the laws that define his office. It's pretty simple. The office is precisely and exactly defined by the laws that create it. End of story. The powers of any official are therefore restricted to that definition. \r\n\r\nCheney, who I do not hate, rather who I completely disrespect based solely on his colossally arrogant, unprofessional, and failed performance, has intentionally stretched the boundaries of what his office and the executive can do. They do this by action and intentional misrepresentation of the law. \r\n\r\nHis visitor logs controversy like everything else he has done, are symptoms of a government official who has clearly by definition of his office, run amok. That's not an opinion, or a gut feeling. It's the reality.\r\n\r\nNow if you have some legal opinion on this you'd like to back up with some law. Go for it. Other than legal statements there is nothing to say here. The president and vice-president DO NOT have the digression to do whatever they want. That's not how their offices are defined.","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39292-8e121ca4-d3a2-455e-9e4b-01dfe32642b5-1566236773"}

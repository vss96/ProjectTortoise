{"body":"Yes I did.   People that think this analysis is brilliant, do yourselves a favor watch the Antony Quinn's movie Secrets of Santa Victoria.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064952/\r\n\r\nThis says it all:\r\n\r\n&gt; it [The movie] gives us the triumph of human resourcefulness and peasant wiliness in the face of overpowering might. \r\n\r\nWhen a soldier walks into a \"sheik's\" home with money in one hand and gun in the other, of course he is on soldier's side.  He would agree with everything you have to say.  Make sure you just don't turn you back.   \r\n\r\nWhat do you think you would do if you were in the Shiek's position?\r\n\r\nThe problem of occupation is not what it has or hasn't done.  It is the goal of US to impose its will on people.   It started with Shock and Awe and have continued since.   In 21 st Century you simply can't do that.\r\n\r\nAs US sees it, it has made sacrifices for its real goal to control the oil (not to get it for free, to control it).  Iraqis would not submit to that.  The longer US is in Iraq the higher the chances it would lose control of places it does have control over oil (e.g. Saudi Arabia).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v49u","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":3,"score":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166408098,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"dmehrtash","edited":false,"id":"cv5zl","parent_id":"t1_cv5ew","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808792,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34943-6258156a-3c63-44c0-a4d4-06c5933caf10-1566236771"}

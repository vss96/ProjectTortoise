It actually deals more with the problem of increasing demand for IT people and decreasing supply. Oddly, enough, since wages don't seem to be going up much, I'm not completely convinced companies are really hurting.\r\n\r\nAlthough part of the problem may be that they then pay someone more or less unqualified, who then does a bad job, and then they complain....\r\n\r\nRegarding his DNA/programming language comments, I think he misses the mark completely. DNA is like binary (okay base 4). All kinds of crazy things happen in DNA expression. \r\n\r\nWorth reading in any case.","created_utc":1166652530,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":2,"ups":2,"subreddit":"programming","id":"cvjt6","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vjgu","author_flair_text":null,"author":"jbstjohn","retrieved_on":1473809058,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41912-c0c28d16-928d-42ce-8888-7b8dda606513-1566236774"}

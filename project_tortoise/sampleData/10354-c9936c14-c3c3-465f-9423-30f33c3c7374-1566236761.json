Yes, that means that his sentence would only be seven and a half years for murder.  But think about how much you changed between the ages of 15 and 23 - can you really say that there's no chance he might?\r\n\r\nThe criminal justice system is there to benefit society, it's not there to maximise punishment.  Yes, it's terrible that he killed a man.  But incarceration cannot possibly make that any better, no matter how long he's locked away for.\r\n\r\nWhat matters is not ensuring things are as bad for him as possible, what matters is ensuring that things are as good for society as possible.  Locking him up for the majority of his life not only costs the taxpayer money, but it prevents him from making a positive contribution to society.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_trhc","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":1165366795,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10354-c9936c14-c3c3-465f-9423-30f33c3c7374-1566236761"}

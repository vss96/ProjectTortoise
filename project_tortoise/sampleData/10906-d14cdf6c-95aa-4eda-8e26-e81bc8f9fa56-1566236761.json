I mean, did it strike anyone else when one of the creators said that he saw the Muslim outrage regarding the comic drawings of Muhammad on TV and he immediately based his next episode on THAT very subject. If that isn't simply \"cashing\" in on the hype and fiasco, then I don't know what is.","ups":-1,"score":-1,"created_utc":1165386295,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_tpok","edited":false,"id":"ctsuo","author_flair_text":null,"author":"gumjo","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473807871,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"10906-d14cdf6c-95aa-4eda-8e26-e81bc8f9fa56-1566236761"}

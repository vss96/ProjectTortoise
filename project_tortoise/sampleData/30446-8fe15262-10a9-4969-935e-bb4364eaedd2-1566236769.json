{"controversiality":0,"body":"Just off of the top of my head:\r\n\r\n+ Checked exceptions are stupid.  They caused the exact problem they were supposed to fix. (Bad error handling because everyone just throwing empty exception handlers around everything)\r\n\r\n+ Primitive types(int,float)/boxing/unboxing is stupid.  Why do you have these on a virtual machine?\r\n\r\n+ Not having functions is stupid.  Why can't you just create a function when you want to? See java.net.URLDecoder.decode() and java.net.URLEncoder.encode().  See also functions in jsp code.\r\n\r\n+ Lack of operator overloading is stupid.  string.equals()? \r\n\r\n+ Bad APIs.  Do the people at Sun eat their own dogfood?  Example: getting a cookie.  The canonical solution to this everyday problem is to cut and paste code since there isn't an API method to do this.  Why hasn't this been fixed yet?\r\n\r\n+ All the null checks.  How can an environment without pointers continuously throw null pointer exceptions?","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_utqb","subreddit":"programming","score":3,"ups":3,"created_utc":1166193237,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"logistix","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_utqb","edited":false,"id":"cuwnr","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808616,"timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30446-8fe15262-10a9-4969-935e-bb4364eaedd2-1566236769"}

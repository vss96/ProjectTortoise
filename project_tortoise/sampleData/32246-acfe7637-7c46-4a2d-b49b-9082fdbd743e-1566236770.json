Last month, 13-year-old Ryan Morgan says he and a friend heard that another student had stashed a gun in a garbage can in the boy's bathroom at Troy Middle School. They went to look for the pellet gun and found it. Ryan says he put it in his pocket, walked back into the lunchroom and 10 minutes later saw an assistant principal and turned it over to him.\r\n\r\nthis is from another article http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=local&amp;id=4850728\r\n\r\nSo, 10 minutes passed from the time he found it to the time he turned it in.  This expulsion is totally unwarranted and teaches the kids not to help out authorities.","link_id":"t3_uvo6","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808688,"distinguished":null,"author":"berberine","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_uvo6","edited":false,"id":"cv0f0","timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32246-acfe7637-7c46-4a2d-b49b-9082fdbd743e-1566236770"}

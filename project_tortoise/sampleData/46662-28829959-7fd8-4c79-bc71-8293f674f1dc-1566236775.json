My problem is that static typing, as conventionally thought of, has _staggering_ costs that most static typing advocates don't even see, because those costs are just \"part of programming\" to them, the base state. The benefits don't justify the costs, except in certain fringe cases.\r\n\r\nIf you drop the cost by making the typing system more intelligent, then my value judgment on static typing will change proportionally. I haven't got anything against finding errors at compile time. I just don't particular care to tell the compiler about each and every goddam variable to accomplish that, information that shows every sign of being highly, highly redundant. (You can identify redundant information in your code when you want to make what is conceptually a simple change, but have to change huge swathes of text. Changing the type of something is almost the canonical example of that sort of redundancy.)","created_utc":1166839239,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":12,"score":12,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"cvt3u","parent_id":"t1_cvsv2","author_flair_text":null,"author":"jerf","retrieved_on":1473809237,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46662-28829959-7fd8-4c79-bc71-8293f674f1dc-1566236775"}

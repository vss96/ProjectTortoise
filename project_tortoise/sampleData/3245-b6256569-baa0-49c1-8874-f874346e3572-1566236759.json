When reading my management textbook the key point was driven home quite well.  Management is getting work done through others.  And you can't do everything yourself.  If you don't understand a legal document, talk to a lawyer.  If you don't understand your taxes or budget, talk to an accountant.  And so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nUntil you get to computers.  My text book actually told me I should get a 64 bit Pentium 4 at a minimum of 1.5Ghz.  I had an entire chapter on neural nets and how to use them for data mining.  It was unreal.  I've been hacking on code in some form or another for 20 years now and still don't quite grok neural nets.  And this book was going on about how wonderful they are and how they can solve any problem. Blahdy blah blah blah.\r\n\r\nIt was at that moment that I felt a stone rise in my throat.  Dear god, I thought, if they're so full of shit about this what else have they been lying to me about?\r\n\r\nSo I have no illusions that management *knew* a neural net was the way to go.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165070062,"score":24,"ups":24,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3245-b6256569-baa0-49c1-8874-f874346e3572-1566236759"}

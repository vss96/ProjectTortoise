Older cultures do tend to focus on the finer thing in life and less on money and work.\r\n\r\nHowever one point this article seems to have missed is the legacy of old power. If you look at other former colonials, this is quite evident. In Latin America and the Indian subcontinent, fairer skin was considered (and still is to a large extent) somehow \"better\". Why ? The fairer skinned white man had ruled over these people for centuries. If you get your ass handed to you from someone else for generations, you will tend to believe the oppressors are somehow \"better\" than you.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of thing applies for American fascination for all things Brit. Here the difference is not in the *paucity* *of* *mellanin*, but in culture. They ruled the US for a long time - and even though that was over 200 years ago, the legacy of that remains till today. Somehow, everything British is more \"sophisticated\" and \"elegant\"... and, this gets reinforced by stereotypes in the movies and media.\r\n\r\nOne only needs to go to a soccer (football) game in Manchester or Liverpool to equalize all this.\r\n\r\n\r\n","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165940623,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"25015-0b4f0faa-573b-4ea8-8c72-9caa54c5b220-1566236767"}

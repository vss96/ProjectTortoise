Is this not illegal in Georgia?  There was that famous case that got made into a movie with Jodie Foster - The Accused - I never did see it, and I don't know the actual history...\r\n\r\nI think the sentence Genarlow Wilson received is ridiculous and horrible and wrong, but shouldn't the authorites at least have investigated the possibility of charging him with that crime, the crime of not at least attempting to stop the rape?  There HAS to be more going on here than they're telling us.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vlsg","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809171,"author":"molasses","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvpnk","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vlsg","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44844-501e1535-a4f4-4ed2-9fd6-60b2e9fe5bb4-1566236774"}

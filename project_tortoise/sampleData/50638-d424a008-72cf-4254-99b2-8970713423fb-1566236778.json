{"body":"I've coded in ruby, python, perl, and all sorts of different languages for the web and I too am still kickin' it on PHP. I've tons of sites running on tens of thousands of LoC in PHP. Version 4 lacked a lot but PHP5 is pretty much all I need. I use frameworks (e.g. QCodo) sometimes but mostly, it's my few simple classes (db, xml etc.) that I use over and over.\r\n\r\nI've written admin backends in RoR and Django but never really liked them because in the end, I still had to do a lot of work to customize things my way.\r\n\r\nJust like Visual Basic 6, PHP is easy to learn and prone to misuse by newbies. However, both of these can be used by experienced coders to actually get work done efficiently.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I wrote some VB apps that have been downloaded over a million times since 2000 and are still in active use by people from all over. Glass2k, Chime TrayPlay, HotChime, and ChimeNote. Each application is less than 100kb and does what it's supposed to do, well. I developed each of these in a matter of hours, compared to the days and weeks I'd have spent on the MFC/C++ versions. Similarly, my PHP sites are fast, efficient, and robust enough to handle a few million dollars of e-commerce business a year and easily deal with 1m+ visits a month. I chuckle every time someone tells me VB or PHP is for amateurs.\r\n\r\nI honestly want to move away from PHP and get into functional languages (Haskell etc.). Not because Haskell &gt; PHP but rather because I want to get away from the typical database management work I've been doing and expand into data analysis. When my needs are different, then I'll need a different tool. Till then PHP5 works wonders.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_w0ju","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":20,"ups":20,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167107976,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"chime","edited":false,"id":"cw137","parent_id":"t1_cw0r1","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809388,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50638-d424a008-72cf-4254-99b2-8970713423fb-1566236778"}

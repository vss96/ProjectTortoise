{"controversiality":0,"body":"In response to the person saying that the Civilans did not know what the Japanese did in nanking at the start of WW2 is COMPLETE BULLSHIT! Take this caption about a newspaper clipping on wikipedia: \"Two Japanese officers, Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda competing to see who could kill one hundred people first. The bold headline reads, \"'Incredible Record' (in the Contest to) Cut Down 100 People—Mukai 106 – 105 Noda—Both 2nd Lieutenants Go Into Extra Innings\"\r\nNukes are bad, we all get that, and what was done was horrible, but the Japanese don't just know that this didn't happen, they actively deny it! Civilians don't deserve to die, but what the Japanese did to the Chinese was 100 time worse. And if you want to thell me that the civilians of 1937 japan had \"no idea\", then fuck you buddy, fuck you.\r\nDo the reasearch and think for yourselves: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_of_Nanking","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w26w","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1167194311,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"mitch_mcnee","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_w26w","edited":false,"id":"cw47u","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809447,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"52304-9b74bb18-9a4c-4fb4-887b-73d107ce268a-1566236778"}

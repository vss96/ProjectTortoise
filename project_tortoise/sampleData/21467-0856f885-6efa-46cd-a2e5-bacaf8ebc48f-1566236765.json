{"body":"Micro-evolution is the concept that individuals change at a genetic level between generations.  This often results in phenotypic changes, which can then result in differential fitness between individuals.  Over a long time period, this results in macro-evolution.\r\n\r\nSpeciation is nebulous because our concept of a species is nebulous.  We have no idea at what point to divide organisms into species.  There are at least 5 different species concepts, none of which is satisfactory to biologists.  Most of the time you will hear about \"reproductive isolation\" as the defining characteristic of species, but what about organisms that do not hybridize in the wild but can do so in the lab?  What do we do with fossils when we cannot tell whether they could have hybridized with other organisms living at the time?  However, this does not mean that we don't understand how evolution works, only that we cannot provide satisfactory definitions.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_ucsv","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165809811,"ups":10,"score":10,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"emc2rae","parent_id":"t1_cudwy","id":"cue2f","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808268,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21467-0856f885-6efa-46cd-a2e5-bacaf8ebc48f-1566236765"}

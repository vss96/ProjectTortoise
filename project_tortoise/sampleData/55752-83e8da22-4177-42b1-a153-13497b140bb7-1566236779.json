{"body":"I upvoted your comment because it's a different perspective that's often lacking on Reddit.\r\n\r\nHowever, historically this \"75 year bubble of relative prosperity\" (actually more like a 115 year bubble of relative prosperity) actually *predates* the public schooling system.  America industrialized before it instituted universal public education; the captains of industry of the time (Carnegie, Rockefeller, Morgan) often provided the funding and advocacy necessary to get public education off the ground.  Many of them, themselves, had little or no formal education.\r\n\r\nThere is also a (fairly persuasive IMHO) school of thought that suggests that the captains of industry instituted mandatory public schooling to *keep people down*.  By controlling how they learn, they can prevent anyone from learning what it takes to challenge their own firms.  Moreover, it increases the supply of semi-skilled labor, driving down wage costs and increasing productivity for their workforce.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_w4pi","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167346534,"author":"nostrademons","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cwadz","edited":false,"id":"cwato","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809572,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55752-83e8da22-4177-42b1-a153-13497b140bb7-1566236779"}

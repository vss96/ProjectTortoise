{"body":"&gt; Thin film photovoltaics may cool much easier than current panels, the way tinfoil cools WAY faster than a block of metal, but that technologies being developed.\r\n\r\nThin-film PV is looking stupendous... if they can get the rate of degradation down to something competitive with conventional crystalline silicon. As it is, incoming light breaks bonds in the silicon and messes up the efficiency much faster than they'd like.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tywe","subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","created_utc":1165545294,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"author":"sketerpot","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cu2cp","parent_id":"t1_cu0f4","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808047,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15143-505e6eea-7277-4915-8787-d5fca1b96cba-1566236762"}

All its various subproblems, like overpopulation.\r\n\r\nEconomics, and its subproblems like communism and capitalism and so forth.\r\n\r\nAnd no doubt others.\r\n\r\nDo you think the conquistadors massacred indians solely because of religion? That minus that one little thing, they still wouldn't have wanted gold, and killed for it? \r\n\r\nDo you think that the salem witch trials weren't about politics? That they didn't want to get rid of rivals in Salem? That they wouldn't have made up non-religious lies to get rid of them? (That family was conspiring with savage indians to wipe us all out, for a cut of the loot!)\r\n\r\nYou can't add up numbers. It's impossible. The numbers are large, no doubt, but claiming that religion is in the lead, based on some numbers is just plain wrong.\r\n\r\nBut feel free to twist words like the fundy biblethumpers. I'm sure that it's justified, just this once, since you're absolutely right about the subject, and you're doing it to save the souls of millions of people.","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166994127,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cvxus","id":"cvxv5","edited":false,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809327,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"48982-1ce45b1f-bf49-46e1-9584-4c8e120c83fc-1566236777"}

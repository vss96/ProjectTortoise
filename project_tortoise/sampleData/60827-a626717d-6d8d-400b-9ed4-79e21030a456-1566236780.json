{"body":"I don't see how it could be interpreted as racist. Someone who understands racism could happen to be black, but just because someone is black doesn't mean they understand racism.\r\n\r\nAnd the fact is, the black people quoted in the article clearly don't understand the phenomena. They talk about this new trend of paying $199 for tennis shoes. Guess what, Booker T. Washington wrote that the reason black people were disadvantaged was that they spent all their money on expensive radios when they didn't have enough money to properly feed their kids, and they spent their time studying classic latin instead of learning a useful trade. That was published in 1901, well before any of the men quoted in this article were even born. \r\n\r\nPretending this is a new trend is bullshit. The whole premise of the article is that \"black people say this, so it must be true.\" \r\n\r\nThinking like this is the reason why society is fucked up, not the explanation.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_wjwi","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":10,"ups":10,"created_utc":1167601831,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"Alex3917","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_cwkr6","id":"cwkt6","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809759,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"60827-a626717d-6d8d-400b-9ed4-79e21030a456-1566236780"}

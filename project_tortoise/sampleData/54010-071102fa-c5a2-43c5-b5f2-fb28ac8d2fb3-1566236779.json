Perhaps not the most tactful of ways to put it, yes. \r\n\r\nBut if you use \"damaged\", or \"traumatized\", or whatever, the point remains the same. The poster I was responding to is a bully, or aspires to be, because of psychological damage resulting from encounters with, well, bullies. \r\n\r\nThat's the worst thing about this kind of pattern. It's a meme, a pattern of data that runs about making copies of itself, and costing us who knows how much of what could otherwise have been. What a waste.\r\n\r\nI don't despise this guy. Ain't his fault. But how sad and afraid does one have to be to go around punching people? And that's not the only kind of damage, the only kind of fear, that warehousing children creates. Look at the teenagers who have gotten on in school, who have \"fit in\". Ever notice how afraid they are to stand out, to express an original thought? To be different? That's how they got through. By hiding. \r\n\r\nSeriously, take a gander around the internet. Lot of broken people out there, a majority in fact. I know the popular response to them is to point at their ridiculous little emo/gothling screeds and laugh, but that's fear, too. All that says is \"look at me, I'm not like that, I'm tough and cynical, and I can take it, no really! Really really!\"\r\n\r\nHow did we get this way?\r\n\r\nWell, lots of ways, of course, but one of them is by warehousing children. By isolating them from adult society, and sticking them instead in a big, government-provided babysitting service, where they are watched over by few people who, even with expensive college degrees, couldn't find better jobs. \r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that neglected kids aren't that good at building a stable, healthy society in their little prison?\r\n\r\nWho here has the attention deficit disorder, I ask you? \r\n\r\nThem? Or us, who can't afford to pay attention to them? There's nothing natural or healthy about kids socializing entirely with their own age group; they're evolved to spend time in and among the *entire* hominid clan-group, where adults outnumber children, and learn how to be human from the whole range of ages. \r\n\r\nSure, home-schooling isn't an ideal solution, but letting children be raised by other children? Ridiculous.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_w4pi","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54010-071102fa-c5a2-43c5-b5f2-fb28ac8d2fb3-1566236779"}

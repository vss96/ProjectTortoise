The Taliban did NOT \"keep opium farmers safe\" when they were in control.  They were in fact much more effective in eliminating opium cultivation than what's followed--which makes sense, because what's followed is chaos, and things like opium cultivation tend to thrive under chaos.  And the opium farmers keep themselves safe; they're pretty heavily armed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I shouldn't conflate the issues...but let's be real here, opium is not a soft drug.  It has serious social and personal consequences, from the individual user to the geopolitical situation.  I think you have to value liberty and personal choice *incredibly* highly, beyond just yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater, if you're going to say that policing opium production is \"stupid\".","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tga8","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165183888,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":2,"score":2,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5458-7c59ecc8-c52e-4229-bb4e-c9580b1806d7-1566236759"}

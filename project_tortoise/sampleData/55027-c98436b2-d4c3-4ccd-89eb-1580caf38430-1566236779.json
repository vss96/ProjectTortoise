The problem is that Dawkins then ignores this premise with his \"can we really be *that* wrong?\" argument.\r\n\r\nEven the tried-and-true scientific measurements of the age of the universe differ from each other by about 1%.  Can you imagine if I tried to say \"that's proof that it's bunk.  Why, if a foreign exchange traders couldn't get the value of  a Euro in dollars to within 1%, they'd lose all their money!\"\r\n\r\nThese examples are, as you've no doubt realized, different measurements in different systems.  With universe-spanning things we are lucky to get in the right order of magnitude.  Ordinary things, like someone's height, we're happy to measure to a margin of error of 1-in-a-100.  But financial traders can make or lose literal fortunes with errors that large.\r\n","score":4,"ups":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167322029,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"cw9da","parent_id":"t1_cw9af","author":"danweber","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809545,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"55027-c98436b2-d4c3-4ccd-89eb-1580caf38430-1566236779"}

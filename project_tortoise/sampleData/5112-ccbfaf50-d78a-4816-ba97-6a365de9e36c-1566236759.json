That would make sense in this case, since \"holes\" in memory are causing fragmentation.\r\n\r\nRuby's implementation on the whole, is very poor.  This is just an example of how the GC could be improved.  Most language implementations these days have some form of Generational collector which automatically compacts objects in memory as it goes.\r\n","retrieved_on":1473807641,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctglo","parent_id":"t3_tgj0","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ricercar","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5112-ccbfaf50-d78a-4816-ba97-6a365de9e36c-1566236759"}

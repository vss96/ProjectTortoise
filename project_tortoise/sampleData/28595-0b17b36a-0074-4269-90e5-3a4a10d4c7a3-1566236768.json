But it is true that it is more accepted now than it used to be, so statistically speaking, (which is what I believe we are talking about here), more people will be willing to face the now negative consequences of coming out, especially now that there is more of a variety of positive supportive communities and sentiment for openly gay people to offset the still negative perception in others than there was in the past.  Thats not to say there is no variation over time, certainly could be.  I'm just not sure you're going to find accurate statistics on the topic.  \r\n\r\nAs for getting modded down, I didn't do it, but don't take it too seriously.  Maybe someone had a bad day?  Maybe someone doesn't like your name?  Your use of the word slutty?  Who knows?  Its best not to put too much stock in your comment ratings, its more important to say what you actually think and risk getting modded down than to pander to ratings and dilute your comments.  Do not fear the downmod!  Sometimes it means you are doing something right, especially if you are encouraging discussion on a sensitive subject which everyone would otherwise avoid bringing up.  (I'll probably get downmodded for this).","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28595-0b17b36a-0074-4269-90e5-3a4a10d4c7a3-1566236768"}

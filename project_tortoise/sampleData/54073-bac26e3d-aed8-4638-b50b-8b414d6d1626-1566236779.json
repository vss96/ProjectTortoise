It seems like this is another manifestation of the futility of the war on drugs. Obviously law enforcement hasn't been able to do anything about drugs over the past 30 years but they're still trying something. They're still grasping at straws. They'll do anything to justify their existence and their mission. They're looking for anything that they can do to hold a press conference. Anything to add another number to the 'drug related arrest' column. The DA can stand up and say 'I'm doing a great job. We just made 49 arrests of people who were supplying meth labs.' It isn't often that it is reported that they just arrested 49 convenience store clerks that sold cough syrup.","score":29,"ups":29,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1167267898,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54073-bac26e3d-aed8-4638-b50b-8b414d6d1626-1566236779"}

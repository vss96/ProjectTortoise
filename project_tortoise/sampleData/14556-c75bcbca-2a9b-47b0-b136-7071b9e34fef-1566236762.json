I'm still in the midst of trying to connect my artistic ability to my web-design skill, so i can't tell you how to get there from here (not having arrived myself).  Starting out may be frustrating, but you gotta start somewhere.  So i'd just say get going, and don't stop if you really do want to improve.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u164","subreddit":"programming","score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1165525348,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14556-c75bcbca-2a9b-47b0-b136-7071b9e34fef-1566236762"}

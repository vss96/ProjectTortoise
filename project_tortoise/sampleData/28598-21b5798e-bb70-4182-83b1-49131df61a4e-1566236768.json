Sure, it's supposed to buy truth.  I'll bet many people suppose so.\r\n\r\nBut this is not how government works.  Politicians have lots of power, and people with power do not use it to support the truth, they use it to support whatever will help them keep their power.\r\n\r\nIf you want scientists to do science, stop giving the money to politicians.  Pay scientists directly, or support companies that do good science.  It's a lot easier to affect the behavior of a company with your wallet (by giving it or taking it away) than it is to affect the behavior of the government with a vote.\r\n\r\nSure, lots of companies are biased.  But you don't have to support them, unless they are also getting your tax money.\r\n\r\nEnough of this \"Let's give all our money to the government and cross our fingers that people will vote for good things\".","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28598-21b5798e-bb70-4182-83b1-49131df61a4e-1566236768"}

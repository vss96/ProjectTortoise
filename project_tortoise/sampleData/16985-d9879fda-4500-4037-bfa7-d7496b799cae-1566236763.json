We didn't have lunch tables either, you just hang around your class room (always bring your own lunch) or go into town for lunch.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't too bad though, there was a girls school next door. Skirts down to the ankles.\r\n\r\nNow you can buy your uniform on-line! http://schooluniforms.ie/\r\n","link_id":"t3_u2bi","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16985-d9879fda-4500-4037-bfa7-d7496b799cae-1566236763"}

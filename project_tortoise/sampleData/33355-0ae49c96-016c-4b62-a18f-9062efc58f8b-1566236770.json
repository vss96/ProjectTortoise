While I know that Time magazine has gotten really pansyish about their MOTY awards in the last decade or two (Gulliani), I was shocked by how crappy this one was.  I thought the whole point was for them to find the one person who had the most impact on the world.  Hitler was the MOTY one year, it was a reasonable assessment, he was impacting the lives of almost everyone in the civilized world.  \r\n\r\nTo make me the MOTY is clearly false.  If your life is so boring that you are forced to wank at 3 pm just to give yourself a reason to stay up then decide that it really isn't worth it and just decide to nap the chances are you aren't MOTY material.  I am going to have to turn down this prestigious award.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_v2l4","stickied":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"33355-0ae49c96-016c-4b62-a18f-9062efc58f8b-1566236770"}

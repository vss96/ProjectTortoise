Within a month she was pointing the same finger at them. \r\n\r\nFortunately it didn't stick the second time around, but the truth didn't come out until after her grandfather took his own life as a result of the humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe point is that an accuser should not be assumed to be automatically right.

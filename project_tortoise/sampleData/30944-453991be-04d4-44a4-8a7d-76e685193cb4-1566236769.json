That's why they're called \"taxes\" and not \"that thing that doesn't have a name because nobody ever does it\".\r\n\r\nRetreating into a libertarian fantasy where we don't have to pay taxes and the market magically takes care of everything is infantilism.  I understand the appeal.  I've even voted Libertarian in the past, and there are days when I'd rather pull the blankets over my head and not get out of bed.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could blow off our responsibilities as citizens and have everything turn out OK.  But we can't.  Taxes?  We're responsible for the most powerful military on the planet and ignoring politics is essentially handing our nuclear arsenal over to...  whoever shows up on election day.\r\n\r\nIf you want to control what *your* nuclear and conventional weapons are used for, **show up**.  It's easier than ever, but voting is not enough.  Phone bank for Move On.  Work on a local grassroots campaign.  Donate to netroots candidates.  Read the news and smart blogs that decode and critique it.  Write and call your representatives and tell them what's important to you.   Push for more transparency, more accountability, more responsibility from our leaders.  Reward those who do their jobs, punish those who don't.\r\n\r\nYes, you will have to care about and work on things that don't go your way.  Yes you will lose more often than you win.  Yes it's a pain in the ass.  \r\n\r\nDo it anyway.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_uqft","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30944-453991be-04d4-44a4-8a7d-76e685193cb4-1566236769"}

No college. He certifies on the x-ray tests every few years. I'm a college grad. I work in IT and management in the same area. He and I earn the same amount of money. I get flex-time and a laid-back atmosphere. He works four ten hour days and gets a 3 day weekend (unless they're really behind). There's ups and downs to both. We're both happy. I get carpal tunnel, he gets blinded, etc.","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473808117,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cu5zv","parent_id":"t1_cu5t9","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16974-8b720037-a813-4162-8af6-58bdb9755b58-1566236763"}

For instance, \"excuse me, maam, the way you are treating her is not OK.\"\r\n\r\nI was in a similar situation on the other side of the counter as a teenage working the McD's drivethru. We messed up some lady's order and she came back trough cursing at me after I had already apologized and promised we'd fix it. But she kept going on and going and was very abusive. At one point she said, \"THis happens EVERY TIME I come here!\" (which was statistically very improbable give our quality of service...we were golden). \r\n\r\nAnyway, when she said that, I came back with, \"Well then why don't you check your bag...Even DOGS can LEARN!\" Which of course, isn't at all what I would say now. \r\n\r\nMy manager wasn't amused but wasn't really angry either, she heard the customer and understood where I was coming from. \r\n\r\nOverall, good learning experience.\r\n\r\n","link_id":"t3_upgw","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808532,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","id":"cus7p","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cus0o","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28275-f040064e-7129-4423-9f5d-45d609cdf19d-1566236768"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"This release seems like a collection of small updates.  It's  nice that they improved the performance, but some things I think are still major misses:\r\n\r\n1.  Annotations: they might as well be comments.  Why can't Sun make annotations similar to .NETs attributes and add logic to them so that, if they are added to a class or method, they can actually do something?\r\n\r\n2.  One JVM to multiple applications: where is it at?  I STILL have to launch virtual machines to applications on a one to one basis.  .NET overcame that hurdle on the first release which made using it on the desktop feasible.  Sun can add all the greatest doodads to the Swing API in the world and no one will use it on the desktop when each app eats 20+ megs of memory and takes upwards to five seconds to start.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_ujwh","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","ups":8,"score":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165929557,"author":"sbrown123","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cukb9","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_ujwh","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808387,"timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24665-a0e4f455-f151-461c-8092-e0f312e6d268-1566236767"}

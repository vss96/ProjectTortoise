Syria benefits from radical Islam's intimidation tactics. So I would say that Syria has taken all the bad parts of Islam (intimidation via violence) and left out all the good parts (an adherence to a higher power and social conservativeness).\r\n\r\nAs for Israel's part in all of this, I do believe they are blameless at this point. It has always been Israel that has tried to negotiate with the Pals. Always Israel that has reached out to its neighbors. It is Israel that is constantly attacked, ever since its inception. Yet they continue to delude themselves with the fantasy that their neighbors can be reasoned with. But \"right of return\" and Hamas' failure to even recognize Israel's existence are 2 stumbling blocks that will never be overcome and that Israel can not ignore. I wish it was different. Peace in the Middle East would be a nice change of pace.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vija","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":-9,"ups":-9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166722690,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43648-fd30bb82-3738-49a9-b6a9-e8d59fd0a0bc-1566236774"}

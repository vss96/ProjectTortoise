Assignment is a \"statement\", and the clause of an if statement must be an \"expression\". Ne'er the twain shall meet.\r\n\r\nArguably, this exact error is the ultimate reason for the distinction.\r\n\r\nThis is also the real reason you can say Python supports OO-Functional style but can not be used as a functional language. Even before functional languages meant \"no assignments and no side effects\", they meant \"everything is an expression\". And that's not true in Python.\r\n\r\nIt's strange; I use \"while (my $x = expression())\" all the time in Perl while never seeming to miss it in Python. (I suppose it's probably the superior support for iterators and the fact that pretty much any Perl code that matches that pattern would be \"for x in expression()\" in Python.)","controversiality":0,"score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1167542097,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"programming","edited":false,"id":"cwipg","parent_id":"t1_cwh4j","author":"jerf","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809720,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236780,"message_id":"59699-23fbe51b-aab2-4341-877c-aedea11df0e7-1566236780"}

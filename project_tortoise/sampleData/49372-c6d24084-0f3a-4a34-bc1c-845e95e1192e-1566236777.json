I took the time to read this particular asshole's piece; you'd think he at least could do the same for Dawkins, especially when he's being paid very well I'm shure for his \"opinion.\"\r\n\r\n...and imagine how this guy's intellectual allies in the Taliban and the Church of the Creator would feel about his assuming the mantle of God (if, of couse, they could read)... He'd be stoned to death by the one and gunned down in a parking lot by the other... whereas we atheists will just snicker at him.

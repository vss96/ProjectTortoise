{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt;\"Children and immature adults often call into question the \"lives\" of their opponents after losing a debate.\"\r\n\r\nYou are doing what you accuse him of doing.  Instead of attacking his arguments you start the name calling game and say he his an \"immature adult.\"  \r\n\r\nI myself like Wikipedia but understand perfectly his point.  Constantly, very interesting articles are deleted.  I found them one day and when I come back latter they are gone. \r\n\r\nWikepia like many web sites where user contribute the content, has become some kind of MMORPG where a group of hardcore users make the law.  Like in MMORPG the more time you invest the more power you get; I can contribute to an article but if someone decide to constantly delete or edit it with some bogus information, I will give up and let him have his way.\r\n\r\nThat group his now obsesses to purge content to make Wikepedia looks more like a \"real encyclopedia\" (whatever that means *Shrug*). I find that goal stupid because if I want a \"real encyclopedia\", I'll go consult one.  What I like about Wikepedia his that I can find information about  the most obscure and almost forgotten subjects. But thanks to those people I can't has easily as it should be. People want to share information but the Wikipedia purging squad doesn't want to let them do it.\r\n\r\nMost contributors are surely well intended and do a great job but sometimes you just need a small group of zealots to ruin things for the others.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tfak","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165173813,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":10,"ups":10,"author":"ArcticCelt","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctgwy","parent_id":"t1_ctfhy","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807649,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5254-2e234c59-d37c-40d2-b8a0-f6f3d2f95619-1566236759"}

I'm not disagreeing with the point you raised about those websites, I don't need to view them to know that you say they exist, I've heard of them.\r\n\r\nAnd you've made no sense at all, only a straw arguement that the anti-Isreal \"crowd\" is on the same level as those websites.  Where is your proof?\r\n\r\nIsreal rightly deserves the criticism that it receives because of it's very actions that are being documented around the world. The public isn't as gulliable as you are, apparently.  Killing is killing and occupation is theft.\r\n\r\nIsrael is also deserving of criticism because of it's manipulation of media information.  So if you think that killing and theft and manipulation are a-okay with you, then you've revealed your own biases in spades.","retrieved_on":1473809060,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"cvjuu","parent_id":"t1_cvjt4","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"lifeofliberty","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"41944-ffddd1ed-397e-42bf-98f6-ef295b167c0f-1566236774"}

Partial explosion is more likely.\r\n\r\nModern nukes are \"plutonium implosion\" types and most likely have something like 64 or more more detonators around conventional high-explosive lenses that press the plutonium in the middle together to cause nuclear explosion. The genius of this design is the fact that explosive lenses are made to explode different speeds in different parts of the bomb. Only if the explosion comes exactly same time from every direction, will the nuke go off as planned. And to calculate the correct timing for each detonator that makes this happen, you need the launch code. Smart. \r\n\r\nBut it is possible that partial nuclear explosion happens. Half kiloton nuclear explosion is still nuclear explosion and the rest of the plutonium will cause big dirty bomb effect around the area.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32955-de8311b0-27e3-421f-858e-8c597cfafabd-1566236770"}

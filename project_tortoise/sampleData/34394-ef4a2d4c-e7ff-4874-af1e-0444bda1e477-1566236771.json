Because blacks are more concerned with their immediate problems, that means that the larger picture is not worth talking about?  What I'm talking about is the big picture and I'm asking you if this is an accurate big picture.  I don't care if it's a popular big picture, my concern is with accuracy.\r\n\r\nOf course people are going to be more concerned with their day to day issues, but leaders need to look at each of these issues within their larger context, otherwise they will be forever fighting different symptoms of the disease.\r\n\r\nMy position is that the disease is being American.  This country wasn't designed for black people, and it doesn't want them.  This is not a melting pot, or some great brotherhood where everyone is welcomed. You are welcomed if you serve this countries agenda.  And recognizing the dignity of blacks has never been anywhere on Americas agenda.\r\n\r\nAs for closing the borders, deporting illegal aliens and eliminating welfare.  If that's where you want to put your efforts, great.  Whether or not that will help black Americans I don't know.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1166388269,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-3,"ups":-3,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t1_cv4yd","edited":false,"id":"cv4zm","author":"rahrahrah","author_flair_text":null,"retrieved_on":1473808774,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34394-ef4a2d4c-e7ff-4874-af1e-0444bda1e477-1566236771"}

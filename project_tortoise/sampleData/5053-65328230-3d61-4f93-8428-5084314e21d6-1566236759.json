See, for example, [this](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=risch+cluster+race).  As [Risch's article](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1196372) puts it:\r\n\r\n&gt;Of 3,636 subjects of varying race/ethnicity, only 5 (0.14%) showed genetic cluster membership different from their self-identified race/ethnicity.\r\n\r\nAs for cultural effects, twin studies do a pretty good job of that.\r\n\r\nWhat you're thinking of is the racial typology of the 19th century, which had very deep roots in a sort of Platonic essentialism.  For some reason scientists in this period were very interested in defining \"precise\" qualitative racial types.  So they would argue over what cephalic index you should have if you were a \"true\" Nordic, etc, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is the work you associate with the phrase \"scientific racism.\"  And it's true - this variety of product (Madison Grant, etc) makes Margaret Mead look like Marie Curie.  Fortunately, if shifting political winds had not terminated this repulsive and meaningless from of physical anthropology, the discovery of Mendelian inheritance and the new Darwinian synthesis would have finished it off anyway.\r\n\r\nThe sad truth is that almost all anthropological research from the 19th and 20th centuries is a bunch of politicized, doctrinal horseshit.","ups":4,"score":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165163782,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"5053-65328230-3d61-4f93-8428-5084314e21d6-1566236759"}

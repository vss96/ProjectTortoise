I hated it. Besides making the code run slower, sometimes a lot slower, it hid a lot of bugs until runtime.\r\n\r\nBut now that C# and VB they are finally adding type inference, my mind is changing. Less typing, but with all the advantages of strongly typed code.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for stongly typed interperted langauges, I have mixed thoughts. For large projects, I think it is essential. But if I am really just writing a few lines of one-off code, then I think it would get in the way.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809206,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvrhp","id":"cvrj8","author_flair_text":null,"author":"grauenwolf","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"45753-18fb5d7f-0715-4543-89a1-bdcd555bbdeb-1566236775"}

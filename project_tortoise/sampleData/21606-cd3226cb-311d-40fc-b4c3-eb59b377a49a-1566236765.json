And to be fair, I've never met a girl in real life who reads any of the above sites, so the stereotype isn't entirely false.

Combine this with the fact that most of the guys who spend all day reading these sites do so because they have no girlfriends, and it's a dangerous combination.\r\n\r\n(Which is true, my girlfriend went home for winter break Friday, so I've been on Reddit 24/7 the last two days)","controversiality":1,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_ue1j","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"21606-cd3226cb-311d-40fc-b4c3-eb59b377a49a-1566236765"}

The aide is a child molester, clear and simple; anyone who interprets a hug from a 4 year old as a sexual advance is thinking of a sexual advance rather than the innocent hug that it undoubtedly was--for this reason alone, the aide needs to be removed from the classroom and possibly prosecuted.  No four year old can initiate sexual contact.  The parents should absolutely sue the school for exposing their child to a pedophile and then attempting to use the machinery of the school to blame the child.  It's outrageous.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_ucm2","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":8,"score":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165834219,"timestamp_epoch":1566236766,"message_id":"21997-2d542157-2c08-4afd-8638-1e9e36bd0492-1566236766"}

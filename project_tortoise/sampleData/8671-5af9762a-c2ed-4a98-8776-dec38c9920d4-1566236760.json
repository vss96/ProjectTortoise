{"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; That's nice. Do you want to pass a law outlawing the \r\n&gt; wearing of sunglasses?\r\n\r\nNow that would just be silly wouldn't it? \r\n\r\nPersonally I don't think there should be laws outlawing anything that isn't directly threatening to the innocent bystander. I should be allowed to consume cannabis at home without being arrested for instance. Similarly I don't think there should be a law outlawing the veil, etc. I think you are reading things between my lines which just aren't there.\r\n\r\n&gt; The whole point is that we are not Iran, we don't want to \r\n&gt; be like Iran. I hope to god my country has not set the bar &gt; so low as to say \"at least we are better then iran\".\r\n\r\nAgreed, no country should aspire to be one step above Iran. \r\n\r\n&gt; Oh how silly of us.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, when to satisfy your right, someone else's right has to remain unsatisfied. \r\n\r\nWhich is not to say that rights aren't important. The rights to education, freedom of religion, safe childhood, freedom of expression, etc. All wonderful. Get's a bit blurry when people start talking about their right to buy a gun without having to wait a few days and take a proficiency test. The right to bear arms gives way to the responsibility of the gun owner to be well-trained and the state to insure that he is a non-criminal.\r\n\r\n&gt; I believe that's the standard communist line.\r\n\r\nDon't know about that. I'm thinking more along the lines of \"ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country\". But JFK was a big commie. That's why they shot him.\r\n\r\n&gt; What about wearing sikh or jewish headgear?\r\n\r\nBear in mind that I don't believe that veils should be outlawed and that my original comment simply introduced a single factor in assessing how \"society-friendly\" the veil is. (The whole facial cue expression thing.) \r\n\r\nIt would seem to me that wearers of Sikh and Jewish headgear, being male, are in a better position to stop wearing that headgear should they ever change their hearts about the way they express their religious affiliation. They are in line with \"western thought\" concerning gender equality. \"Nothing to see here, just a guy with a funny hat.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand veil wearers being women in a male-dominated culture are not in line with westerd ideals concerning gender equality. (AFAIK, Israel is the only country in the middle east where women can vote.) Something to see here. An oppressed woman. \"Should I talk to her. Can I talk to her. Will her husband attack me for talking to her. That's obviously why he makes her wear the veil, right?\"\r\n\r\nThere is some resistence to introducing into western society \r\na vestige from cultures where women are treated so badly. I guess that Europeans might fear that introducing such a visible aspect of misogynistic culture into Europe might also introduce the glaringly negative aspects of those societies as well. But, WTF do I know. I don't live in Europe. It's an interesting debate, though. \r\n","link_id":"t3_qpu3","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165316517,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ryant71","parent_id":"t1_cto8w","id":"ctoei","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807788,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8671-5af9762a-c2ed-4a98-8776-dec38c9920d4-1566236760"}

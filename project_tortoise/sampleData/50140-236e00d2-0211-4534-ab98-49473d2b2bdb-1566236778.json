The problem is the Unobtainium required for construction. The tensile strength required for an earth based beanstalk is enormous.  Some folks are hoping that carbon nanotube fabrication will advance to allow us to make an elevator.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, carbon nanotubes are strong enough for this application. But to date, we've only grown nanotubes to a few centimeters length. In practice, combining the tubes into large structures and retaining their theoretical strength is not even close to practical yet.\r\n\r\nThere are many options for powering the climbers.  Earth based laser power transmission is certainly one of them.\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809372,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cw02s","id":"cw099","edited":false,"author":"dbenhur","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"50140-236e00d2-0211-4534-ab98-49473d2b2bdb-1566236778"}

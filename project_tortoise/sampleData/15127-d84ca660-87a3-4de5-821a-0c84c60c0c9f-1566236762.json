It's no excuse to be sloppy.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you have a choice between slightly cooler code that does things with 4 fewer statements or making the code easy to understand, I'd go with the latter option.\r\n\r\nThe only time I'd go with the former is when it makes the code faster.  If the code isn't clear, it won't last the next time you or another developer touches it anyway.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808047,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t1_cu1c5","edited":false,"id":"cu2bn","author_flair_text":null,"author":"nosoupforyou","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"15127-d84ca660-87a3-4de5-821a-0c84c60c0c9f-1566236762"}

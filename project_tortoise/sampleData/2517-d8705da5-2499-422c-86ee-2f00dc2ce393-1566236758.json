It basically went down exactly how the author of the New Yorker described it -- with one exception:\r\n\r\nApparently the couple DID call the pilot's bluff, saying go ahead and divert the plane and arrest us -- knowing that American Airlines would get terrible publicity for diverting a plane because of a gay kiss -- so the pilot relented.\r\n\r\n(The author of the message below is an American Airlines flight attendant who knew one of the parties involved and got a first-hand account from him.)\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flyertalk.com/forum/showpost.php?p=6406501&amp;postcount=75\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bigger issue here than the gay kiss, however, is the \"power trip\" that so many flight attendants are on post-9/11. They will divert a plane over a bottle of water (happened multiple times during the August 2006 insanity), because Middle Eastern-looking men start playing with their cellphones (happened on the infamous KLM flight a couple of months ago), etc. They need to be held accoutable for their despicable behavior rather than being heralded as \"better safe than sorry\" or \"they were doing it because other passengers felt uncomfortable, even though nothing illegal was going on.\"\r\n\r\nA bigot is a bigot -- just because the bigotry is coming from a flight attendant at 35,000 feet doesn't make it justified.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1165019952,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":4,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"ctark","parent_id":"t3_t6wc","author_flair_text":null,"author":"ajax","retrieved_on":1473807531,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"2517-d8705da5-2499-422c-86ee-2f00dc2ce393-1566236758"}

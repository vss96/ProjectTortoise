Ok, the first 5 minutes, no big deal. The next 8 hours?\"\r\nUm, two women making out next to me on a plane for 8 hours? YES PLEASE!\r\n\r\nOn a serious note, I won't deny that sitting next to two men kissing would make me slightly uncomfortable. That's just because I'm not used to it. I also used to feel a sharp icicle down my neck whenever someone said \"shit\" \"fuck\" or \"damn.\" But you know what happened? I grew up. I learned that there are a million different ways to live a life that are entirely different from one's own, and that if you just let all those uncomfortable moments slide away, appreciate the positive points as it were, you'll open yourself up to new ways of thinking and the world will be more beautiful to you. \r\n\r\nAll those personal preferences are just useless baggage. Let them go and just be human. I used to hate mayonnaise, as a kid I used to cry when it was on my sandwich. Now I could care less. It's not my favorite condiment in the slightest, but I just shrug and enjoy the other tastes in the sandwich that I do like. And you know what? Without that fear and judgement, the sandwich manages to be pretty damn good.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1164994950,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"ct941","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ct8vg","author_flair_text":null,"author":"madmax_br5","retrieved_on":1473807500,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1604-49644425-4550-4c3d-8cc3-b6f899b04f05-1566236758"}

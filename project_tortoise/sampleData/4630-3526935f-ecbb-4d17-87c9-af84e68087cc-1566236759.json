{"controversiality":1,"body":"The entire enterprise of ranking presidents is skewed by the force of personal opinion, even by those pesky academic egghead sorts. This is all subjective . . . take Coolidge. He is admired by conservatives as a man that perfected the laissez-faire execution of policy, and loathed by liberals as a politician that put the country on cruise control while he bedded with Big Business ( the broken-record lament of the progressive/liberal with every Republican president since Harding). Libertarians such as myself see the validity in both complaints, but tend to admire his more hands-off approach to governing. \r\nThen there are the Buchanans, Nixons and Bushes of the American Presidency. Few observers, of any political stripe, would be inclined to defend the raw, unabashed detrimental actions which these men performed ( and in Bush's case, still performing). If any one cares to so much as skim the Constitution, they would likely absorb a sobering truth: the government that exists today exists apart from this guiding document, in both spirit and deed. This is not the exclusive fault of Bush, or the neo-cons. But they have pushed and accelerated the machine away from the people (Tenth Amendment, anyone?) in a manner that is both aggressive and appalling. Foner, while usually holding a reverential view of big government, seems to understand that there is a unique, and sad, piece of history before us. Unique because a broad majority of people agree that this administration is a disaster. Sad because each of us have to live through it.","link_id":"t3_tegi","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165131396,"score":-1,"ups":-1,"author":"hoobieboo","author_flair_text":null,"id":"ctfcu","parent_id":"t3_tegi","edited":false,"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807618,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"4630-3526935f-ecbb-4d17-87c9-af84e68087cc-1566236759"}

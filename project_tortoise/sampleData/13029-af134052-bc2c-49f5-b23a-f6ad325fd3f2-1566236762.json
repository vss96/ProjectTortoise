But sometimes it takes more time to get a program to compile then to fix some simple runtime bugs in Java.\r\n\r\nIn Java a NPE is normally quite fast and easy to fix, the problem is that those things often happen when you don't expect it. That's the big advantage of Haskell (or similar languages): If the program compiles most of the trivial errors are already eliminated and because of this simple tests aren't as necessary as in more dynamic languages like Java, Ruby or Lisp. This can increase productivity.\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_twtt","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473807957,"distinguished":null,"author":"kawa","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"ctxho","parent_id":"t1_ctxgd","timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13029-af134052-bc2c-49f5-b23a-f6ad325fd3f2-1566236762"}

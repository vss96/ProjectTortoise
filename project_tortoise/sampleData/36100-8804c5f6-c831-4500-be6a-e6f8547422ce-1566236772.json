I refuse to wear the stuff but usually come back with, on average, about four different shirts (I go out of my way to stop at booths for this stupid stuff).  Anyways, the vast majority end up as night shirts since, no matter how small I get them, they appear to all be intended for some fictitious cylinder person.  No, they don't appear to be intended for men either since we 'V' (one way or the other).  Those that I do get too small are too tight in the breast and hip area for her.  Thanks for drawing attention to those horrid uni-sex shirts.","link_id":"t3_v4hp","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"36100-8804c5f6-c831-4500-be6a-e6f8547422ce-1566236772"}

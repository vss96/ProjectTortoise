{"controversiality":0,"body":"Exactly. His deal with the MPAA was just a great way for him to get a paycheck.\r\n\r\nI think they went to him because Tim Berners-Lee turned them down for a WWW licensing arrangment and therefore they could not make a webpage for themselves.\r\n\r\nThey honestly have no idea what bittorrent is, what a protocol is or what a standard is. They live in a different world. Want to make a DVD for your movies, pay a licensing fee, want to use a trademark in your film, make a deal.\r\n\r\nThey heard about bittorrent, they found the guy who invented it and who had bittorrent.com and they made a deal with him, probably thinking \"well that solves that problem\".\r\n\r\nYou're going to blame Bram for selling out to retards when it didn't hurt anyone except the MPAA and he got paid? He's always been about getting paid.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u03j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1165531747,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":15,"ups":15,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"freshhawk","id":"cu1o1","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu0x8","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808035,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"14784-501f5668-9f31-45d1-816c-1d5ca5a61728-1566236762"}

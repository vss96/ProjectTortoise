{"controversiality":0,"body":"I think syntax is important because it's hard to change once a language is established and it can take a while to learn the deficiencies of any particular system. Also bad syntax design can be a real pain to write but especially hard to read.\r\n\r\nI think we've come along way since early Fortran, but even haskell has its newbie baiting quirks (indentation for if then else for example) and Lisp has slightly more syntax than just bare S-exprs.\r\n\r\nSimple things like comment delimiters can have an impact. I'm only really comfortable with // /* */ # ; and -- anything with parentheses or angle brackets confuses me no end (could just be my lack of exposure to them though).\r\n\r\nWirth-esque syntax (Pacal, Ada) seems to have been invented by an RSI demon with a penchant for visual clutter.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_uqo3","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166090281,"author":"naughty","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cuqx8","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cuqvx","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808509,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"27735-aa166a03-bc8f-45e7-a55d-c0247fcdca60-1566236768"}

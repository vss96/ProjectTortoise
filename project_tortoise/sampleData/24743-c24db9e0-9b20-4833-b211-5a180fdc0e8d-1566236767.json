All this gets you is a wall full of toilet paper rolls in inconvenient locations, and a lot more of your money tied up in toilet paper.\r\n\r\nThere's two forms of running out that are relevant here: (a) a roll running out and needing to be replaced, and (b) running out of replacement rolls.\r\n\r\nA single dispenser will run out and need replacing at relatively regular intervals.  You can avoid a roll running out in an emergency by replacing them early, but this wastes paper.\r\n\r\nTwo dispensers and a replacement roll are enough avoid the emergency situation without waste, if the people maintaining the bathroom are sufficiently diligent.\r\n\r\nAdditional stock simply means you have to resupply less often, but you have to buy it and store it; it's a straightforward cost-benefit analysis to find the optimal balance here.","link_id":"t3_uixh","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24743-c24db9e0-9b20-4833-b211-5a180fdc0e8d-1566236767"}

That is where observance and being a \"witness\" to your child's growth enters the occasion.  This is what I consider a sacred trust.  My children depend upon me to witness their growth.  I, as witness, must provide feedback and assign values to what I percieve their path looks like - at least in my \"experience\".  Together, we must create a safe space to communicate our objectives.  Sounds easy.  \r\n\r\nThe article specifically stated that this was not for everyone.  Not everyone has the time, energy or willingness to be a witness.  That's okay.  Ultimately every parent does what they think is best based upon their knowledge at the time.\r\n\r\nSome parents - like us - buy books like \"The Dangerous Book For Boys\" and place them on our child's mid to high bookshelves.  He won't be able to see it for another 5 years, but it is there waiting for him. \r\n\r\nRegardless, what I don't hear parents discussing is the constant vigilance required with unschooling.  And the active, on-going, non-judgemental dialog necessary to achieve success.  \"What are you reading?  What do you think about it?  Why?  Wow, I hadn't thought about that way before?\"  It's a lot of work.  \r\n\r\nAnd then try taking this philosophy into a classroom!  But, ultimately it is worth it. (And I'm not even going to try to define my 20 year old as a \"product.\"  Because what it is about is the process...not the valuation of children as a \"verification of our beliefs.\") I just love success stories about parents who have made similar \"alternative choices.\"","timestamp_epoch":1566236778,"message_id":"53545-4815de60-2b63-4188-b215-3d3503e4e738-1566236778"}

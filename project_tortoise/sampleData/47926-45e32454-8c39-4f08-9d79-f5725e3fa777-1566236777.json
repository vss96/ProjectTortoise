The N64 had some great games, but you need good games and mediocre ones that people want to buy for the sake of it (movie tie-ins etc.) I personally loved the Dreamcast and thought it was ground-breaking. Internet (granted too early), VMUs were a good idea, really only shined in it's later life (don't they all?). It as the author observes, also  was released earlier than the new generation. So you can have great games, brand recognition, old school favourites but the only thing I see as a constant is people buying into the Playstation brand.","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166918703,"subreddit":"reddit.com","parent_id":"t3_vtff","id":"cvvru","edited":false,"author":"Dead1nside","author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809287,"gilded":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"47926-45e32454-8c39-4f08-9d79-f5725e3fa777-1566236777"}

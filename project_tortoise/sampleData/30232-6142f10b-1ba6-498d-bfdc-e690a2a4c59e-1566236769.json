A lot.\r\n\r\nProperties also give you the ability to make mistakes, and correct them later. For example you've made a field public because you had no reason to make it private, and later you realise that it should really be private + accessor.\r\n\r\nIn Java, you can't. Period. So everything gets wrapped in useless methods everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn other languages (Python) you leave the fields public, and if you realise that you've made a mistake you can come back and replace the field with a property without fundamentally breaking the interface.\r\n\r\nIn yet other languages (Smalltalk, Ruby) there's no public fields, but there is syntactic sugar to create default accessor properties (which is equivalent to making fields public), and if you ever need to perform specific operations on a field, you can replace the default properties by custom ones yet again without breaking anything.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, let's not talk about C#, MS' implementation of properties is retarded.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166185843,"score":1,"ups":1,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236769,"message_id":"30232-6142f10b-1ba6-498d-bfdc-e690a2a4c59e-1566236769"}

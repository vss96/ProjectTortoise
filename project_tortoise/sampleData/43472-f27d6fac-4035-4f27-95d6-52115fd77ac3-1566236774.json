I specifically chose reddit over digg because the results seemed more honest. And low and behold jesusfreak went and proved that top Digg users were \"gaming\" dig by pack voting. I personally trust no system in which the secret sauce can not be verified. Reddit has had a good run to get itself established. If it doesn't take the next steps it will find itself replaces by systems that do.\r\n\r\nThe problems with reddit have not been \"solved\". Reddit remains barely workable because the core devs have refused to get enough talent onto the project to make it feasible. You'll note that most sites have more than 3 devs working on them.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_vgqk","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809123,"author":"smacfarl","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvn5s","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cvjjx","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"43472-f27d6fac-4035-4f27-95d6-52115fd77ac3-1566236774"}

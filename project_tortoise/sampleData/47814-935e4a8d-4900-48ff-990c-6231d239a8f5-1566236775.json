The US has supposedly been working on something like this to boost the deployable range of soldiers. These will likely use the minature jet turbines.\r\n\r\nAlso the ability of a missile to track heat is based on the sensors it carries. Shrinking the size of a missile, reduces the cost significantly so more can be made for the same cost, which then means better heat sensors can be mass produced and the missiles still deployed at a cheap cost.

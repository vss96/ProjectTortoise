It just goes to show me that there are dipshits on both sides of the counter.\"\r\n\r\n*(Let me make sure I understand)* The customer trying to resolve an issue with customer service is a *dipshit* **Unless** that person happens to be *you.* THEN it's the customer service person(s) who are dipshits. It's just possible you might want to reconsider your defense of customer service, in general.\r\n\r\nAnd what a thoughtful gift! Money. It's like \"I don't know you well enough to even attempt to guess what you might like, but here's some money -- now go away.\" \r\n\r\nAnd you have the nerve to make a reference to retarded people -- as some sort of slam against customer service people (excuse me -- just the CS people who didn't please YOU). I might be tempted to forgive someone who saw you as a shallow, self-centered scrooge who thinks the world should revolve around you.","score":0,"ups":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166837104,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236775,"message_id":"46600-3431fb10-8853-47e2-bc83-1e5dfc339b13-1566236775"}

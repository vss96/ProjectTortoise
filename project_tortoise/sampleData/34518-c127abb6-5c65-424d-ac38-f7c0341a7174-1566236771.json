The Shao-Lin monks' \"spiritual\" training was prioritized over the martial arts.  It was very important to the temple that people not abuse their power, thus there was a major focus on what kind of *person* you were, not merely how much ass you could kick.\r\n\r\nThe more power you have, the more responsibility you have, and most people just do not act responsible by default.  You learn to share things when you're little, and not be selfish, and those kind of moral lessons need to continue throughout life.\r\n\r\nIn most responsible martial arts schools, the teacher will tell you that if he finds out you've been bullying people, you'll get kicked out.  Police departments need to start doing this instead of covering up each other's misdeeds.  Police will act with GREAT discretion if they know that they risk throwing away all that academy and training time, plus a job with benefits, by acting in such an unfit manner.\r\n\r\n","controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808778,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"cv58a","parent_id":"t1_cv4ru","author_flair_text":null,"author":"lemmikins","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34518-c127abb6-5c65-424d-ac38-f7c0341a7174-1566236771"}

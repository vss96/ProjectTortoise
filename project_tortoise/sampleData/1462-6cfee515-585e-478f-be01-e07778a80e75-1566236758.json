Every time we think we have it defined we discover another criteria that our definition does not meet but should.\r\n\r\nFor me, intelligence is pretty much binary at this point. If you are able to say \"I don't know the answer to that\" and are troubled enough by that lack of knowledge to at least seriously consider fixing it, you are \"really smart\".\r\n\r\nEveryone else is an idiot.","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t576","subreddit":"programming","score":4,"ups":4,"created_utc":1164992254,"author_flair_css_class":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236758,"message_id":"1462-6cfee515-585e-478f-be01-e07778a80e75-1566236758"}

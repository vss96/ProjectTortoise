It seems to assume that the Republican or Democratic party is entitled to those votes, and I don't think that's true. You can't \"take votes away\" from a Party. The votes aren't theirs. The vote is yours to do as you please, and the sooner people realize that and stop voting for the Republicans and Democrats simply because to vote for anyone else is to \"throw your vote away\", the better our political situation will be.","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166382920,"score":21,"ups":21,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236771,"message_id":"34259-27e1b1f2-f680-4035-8fba-5b8275b48fdf-1566236771"}

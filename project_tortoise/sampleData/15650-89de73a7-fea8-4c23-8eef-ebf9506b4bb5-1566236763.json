They sit in their comfortable suburban homes and weep about the poor underpaid workers in a 3rd world country while wearing their el-cheapo Tesco clothes.\r\n\r\nCome on ladies! Wake up. These workers are there because they get paid more than other workers in their country. They are feeding and clothing their families on the money. They want and need the work.\r\n\r\nIf these people are so concerned, why don't the jump on a plane and go see for themselves. ALL 3rd world countries pay minimum salaries to unqualified workers. Same in Thailand, Cambodia, China, VN, Phils. \r\n\r\nWhy don't these people DO something instead of whining?\r\n","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u3a9","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808066,"distinguished":null,"author":"ThaiTai","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cu3bo","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_u3a9","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15650-89de73a7-fea8-4c23-8eef-ebf9506b4bb5-1566236763"}

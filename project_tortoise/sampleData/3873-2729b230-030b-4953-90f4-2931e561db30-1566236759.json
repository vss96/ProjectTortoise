Then I tried having it generate a simple statement it determined to be grammatical and the first thing it came up with was \"computer not a machine\".  I'm not joking.  MIND YOU it was completely randomly generated and simply classified as being 'grammatical' so it wasn't really trying to say anything.  Or was it?  ;D","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165096556,"score":9,"ups":9,"subreddit":"programming","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"3873-2729b230-030b-4953-90f4-2931e561db30-1566236759"}

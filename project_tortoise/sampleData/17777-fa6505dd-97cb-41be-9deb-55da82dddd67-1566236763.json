Haha, what an idiot!!\"\r\n\r\nEveryone tries their best to be what they think is a good person. Everyone from the guys selling hotdogs on the street corner to genocidal maniacs. Everything we've ever done, we've done because it made the most sense at the time. So if you truly believe this, it means we should never criticize anyone ever.\r\n\r\nI don't believe that.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, she's not trying to be what she thinks is a good person, she's trying to be what someone else told her is a good person. The entire problem here is that she's not thinking.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why we make fun of her. Because she deserves it. For not thinking. \r\n\r\nIt's really no different for making fun of someone for voting without reading the paper, except that since it's religion you think it should get a free pass.\r\n\r\nFuck that.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u69m","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808140,"distinguished":null,"author":"Alex3917","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cu78h","parent_id":"t1_cu6tv","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17777-fa6505dd-97cb-41be-9deb-55da82dddd67-1566236763"}

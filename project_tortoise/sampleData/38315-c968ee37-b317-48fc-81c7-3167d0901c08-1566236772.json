The financial exposure takes into account social insurance exposure, but fails to take into account the funds that will be covering it. This is like saying a family that owes a mortgage is a half million in the hole - sure, but they also expect an income over the next 30 years to cover it, and won't have to pay rent.\r\n\r\nThe real problems are the debt, the fact that the debt will make it harder to repay the Social Security trust fund, and the rising Medicare costs of an top-heavy aging population.\r\n\r\nBut the current obligation is not 50 trillion. More like 8 trillion. Clinton showed that you can whittle it down over the short term. Bush showed that you can worsen it considerably over the short term.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vc4j","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808924,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"anonymous-coward","id":"cvcxv","parent_id":"t3_vc4j","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236772,"message_id":"38315-c968ee37-b317-48fc-81c7-3167d0901c08-1566236772"}

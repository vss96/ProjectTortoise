No, But if you start having conditionals and abstractions and loops and variables... you've really got to question whether you should have just used a \"real\" language in the first place, rather than try to specially create a \"declarative\" language.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the entire point of creating that declarative language in the first place was probably to try to escape from the world of variables and loops and conditionals etc. If you fail in that goal, it calls into question the entire system. And I've seen what happens when declarative languages morph into full languages any number of times. It's hideous.","timestamp_epoch":1566236777,"message_id":"49458-2a5b4c88-e00d-4f9c-b113-280aa5c5843a-1566236777"}

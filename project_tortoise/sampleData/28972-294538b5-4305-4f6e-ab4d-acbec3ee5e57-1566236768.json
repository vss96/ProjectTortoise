{"body":"I don't mean to be rude, but what the hell is this supposed to mean? \r\n\r\n&gt;a portion of the reddit database was stolen recently...we have no reason to believe that reddit data was the target of the theft,\r\n\r\nHuh? Was the data stolen or not? Which usernames were affected? Whose emails/passwords were involved? Where they encrypted? I use the same password for my email as I do for reddit, and my email contains lots of personal information. Should I change my email password? And if by chance I didn't visit reddit today, would I have found out about this?\r\n\r\nPlease be more upfront about this. A halfassed, wishy washy note isn't going to cut it here.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_usqe","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":13,"ups":13,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166132193,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"cyrano741","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_usqe","id":"cuths","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808557,"timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28972-294538b5-4305-4f6e-ab4d-acbec3ee5e57-1566236768"}

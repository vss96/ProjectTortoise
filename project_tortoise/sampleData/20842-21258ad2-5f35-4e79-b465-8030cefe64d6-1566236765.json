(Mind you it seems to have been shifted in another direction).\r\n\r\nNote: \"the vile hatred which exists against Christians is just plain wrong and totally unwarranted.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement tells me quite a bit about you, assuming you meant what you wrote.\r\n1) \"hatred which exists against christians\". I don't think people hate Christians (a nice blanket statement you try to pull off as truth). Look at some polls in the USA that asks what the biggest threat in the country is. Atheism ranks amongst the top. So i am confused how you think christianity is unfairly treated, please justify.\r\n2) \"Wrong\", do you think it's wrong to criticize a theory that has repeatedly contradicted itself time and time again or to just have a different opinion? I'm curious to hear your opinion on the act of Sept.11/06. (the anti-abortion NUT)\r\n3) \"Totally unwarranted\" - I guess thats an opinion. I say that when some of the worst problems in the world right now are due to religion (not just christianity in general) a little outrage is totally WARRANTED!\r\n\r\nNote: I believe the moral basis that religion teaches (be nice, don't kill, do onto others... etc) is positive. Its the extremes that create problems. That, and the innability to accept facts when they are presented.","link_id":"t3_ua04","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808248,"distinguished":null,"author":"cman_04","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"cud0l","parent_id":"t1_cucya","timestamp_epoch":1566236765,"message_id":"20842-21258ad2-5f35-4e79-b465-8030cefe64d6-1566236765"}

Yes. Will there come a time where the 88MB of RAM limit what can be done to the system (as opposed to 512 in both compeating systems)? Yes.\r\n\r\nIn the console wars, the cheapest system has never really 'won'.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_w37e","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473809536,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"redrobot5050","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cw7nl","id":"cw8s9","timestamp_epoch":1566236779,"message_id":"54750-fb6f48e8-980b-4844-a034-d9e7750cad4b-1566236779"}

The corporation won--same as almost always.  You may think Mr Tweek \"was winning\" but he was not.  In the end, Tweek Coffee was out of business and Harbucks won.  The corporation railroaded into town.\r\n\r\nTo prove my point about \"railroading\", imagine that, instead of Harbucks, some new local coffeeshop opened across the street from Mr Tweek.  The story would have been very, very different.  The new store would have had an 20% chance of staying in business and a 10% chance of killing off Tweek Coffee.  Harbucks (a mega-corp franchise) had a 95% chance of of staying in business and a 50% chance of killing off Tweek Coffee.  (Percentages are my estimates based on what I have seen happen.)","timestamp_epoch":1566236761,"message_id":"9529-a46327de-9480-477d-9fe9-ca2b749fafff-1566236761"}

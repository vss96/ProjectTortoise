Try walking in an airport and being a Muslim. Good luck not being noticed/stared at. Also, what's the reason non-Muslims would go to Mecca in the first place? If they are not a Muslim, then the reason is obviously not relating to the primary purpose Muslims visit Mecca, and that is to make a religious journey. They obviously do not want people who are there for sightseeing, or reporting, or whatever purpose that does not relate to religion or practicing it - since the place itself is heavily crowded.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808551,"gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_upl4","id":"cut7k","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"gumjo","timestamp_epoch":1566236768,"message_id":"28809-b488324a-9f77-413f-a286-5d8313cd471d-1566236768"}

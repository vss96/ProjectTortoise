Unfortunately Java doesn't support straightforward, *general* TCO as a result of a deliberate decision in the design of Java's security model.\r\n\r\nTCO is possible, though hacky and not terribly performant, on the JVM; see Schinz and Odersky's 2001 paper \"Tail call elimination on the Java Virtual Machine\".\r\n\r\nIMHO the incredibly arrogant attitude of the Java leadership, which leads them to conclude that the only industrial use of first-class continuations is continuation-based web applications; and these aren't terribly earth shattering anyway, therefore Java developers have no need for continuations, is what spells the death knell for Java as a serious platform.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft .NET includes native support for making tail calls, and a lot of functional research has gone on using the .NET CLR. If functional programming is going to break into the mainstream (and I anticipate that happening real soon now), it will be via .NET, not Java.","controversiality":0,"timestamp_epoch":1566236770,"message_id":"32417-329e26fd-98b6-4362-a858-6ab139a28e04-1566236770"}

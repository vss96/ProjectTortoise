Looking on wikipedia for MPs in the UK and selecting the first few alphabetically, we have:\r\n\r\n* Hywel Francis - Professor\r\n* Frank Doran - Solicitor\r\n* Anne Begg - School teacher\r\n* John Reid - Career politician\r\n* Gerald Howarth - Banker, family wealth\r\n* Richard Shepherd - Company director, presumably wealthy\r\n* Graham Brady - PR consultant\r\n* Mark Tami - Union official\r\n\r\nOverall, I wouldn't say these people are particularly wealthy.

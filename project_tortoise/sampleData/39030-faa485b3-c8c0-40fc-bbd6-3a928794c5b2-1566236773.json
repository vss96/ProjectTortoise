If somebody is found guilty he's got to follow the guidelines. If he doesn't then the prosecution can appeal to a higher court to get what they'd call an 'unduly lenient' sentence overturned.\r\n\r\nJuries can refuse to apply the law, if they think the law is stupid, and have the power to acquit someone even in the face of overwhemling evidence. Juries shouldn't, and it doesn't happen very often, but it's not completely unheard of.\r\n\r\nThe real villain is the prosecutor, who could have chosen not to bring this case - any number of reasons can be given, the best and vaguest is that a conviction wouldn't be \"in the public interest\". But district attorneys tend to be elected and in a contest between a rational \"let's take a balanced approach\" and an emotional \"lock 'em all up and throw away they key\" the latter almost always wins. You couldn't think of a more effective approach for breeding bloodlust.","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1166556196,"score":7,"ups":7,"subreddit":"reddit.com","timestamp_epoch":1566236773,"message_id":"39030-faa485b3-c8c0-40fc-bbd6-3a928794c5b2-1566236773"}

You gain investment in a foreign company, but your investment and profits are still in dollars which shaves some of your margin again as the dollar loses value and companies in many cases offer ADRs in America because they have a heavy American exposure (meaning the degree of your foreign exposure might not be so big, like with Toyota or Honda--though I like both these stocks as ADRs).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, ADRs often see very light volume (and may even be pink-sheeted) even though the company is solid.  Honda (HMC), a stock I recently owned and sold to great success (I've had many more failures to date), has a 3m-average volume of 450K compared against Ford's (F) 31mn.  While this isn't a dealbreaker, results are results, it does lead to some nailbiting price volatility.  This isn't digg so Nintendo fandom might not catch, but investing in Nintendo's ADR (NTDOY.PK) a year ago would have netted you close to 150% *gain* (52-wk range $13 -&gt; $30).  The problem?  You're buying a pink sheet with 144K daily volume.  And I'm giving you some of the biggest ADRs.  Louis Vuitton's umbrella (LVMHF.PK), by no means a minor company or a poor investment, sees volume in the 4-digits daily.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I got a little wrapped up in what I'm saying, but smart investing is even tough for somebody with funds and such like myself, I can't imagine how high the barrier to entry would be for those with substantially fewer finances than me.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_tkm9","subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236760,"message_id":"8390-3f7fddd4-1c89-4164-8c2a-d1bfe4fb1306-1566236760"}

I'm just pointing out that the conventional wisdom that \"Russia can't be beat\" is wrong. It's been beaten many times, including by Germany.\r\n\r\nRe: Waiting for Britain to be destroyed. No: Hitler never should have attacked Britain in any way. It was impotent for quite some time after Dunkirk. He should have attacked Russia at the very first chance.\r\n\r\nAnd I left out the single biggest mistake in this context: Hitler's declaration of war against the US. There was _no_ public interest in war with Germany, and it may never have happened without Hitler's blunder. Even then, the public expectation was that we would devote ourselves against Japan--instead, British propaganda steered us towards Europe.","link_id":"t3_u5eq","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808140,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mynameishere","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu74z","id":"cu77y","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17765-f987b816-3025-46af-b0cf-d8a4fac2c270-1566236763"}

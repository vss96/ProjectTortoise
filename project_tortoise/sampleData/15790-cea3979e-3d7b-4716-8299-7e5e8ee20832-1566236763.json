{"body":"Proof? hah\r\n\r\n1) Yes they are, such is life\r\n\r\n2) But you are acknowledging the fact that they DID make a mistake when quoting him the price. Whether this is a common mistake is open to interpretation, but any educated person that's not a call center floor manager can recognize that two thousandths of one dollar is 100 times more than two thousandths of one cent.\r\n\r\n3) It was only 27 minutes, the audio was just long for some reason. $71 is alot more than he expected to pay. Good for you that 27 minutes or 2 hours of your time isn't worth that much but it certainly is to him, what's your point?\r\n\r\n4) He did, because he got confused himself talking to these reps that were obviously unable to grasp simple math. A 100 fold difference in price is not semantics, it's a very meaningful difference.\r\n\r\n5) Perhaps he could have explained better, but over 27 minutes talking to two people they should have figured this out. The completely misunderstanding of basic math on the part of these two Verizon reps is astounding.\r\n\r\n6) Sure he was a little bit rude, but only because he was frustrated. I don't blame him. It's ridiculous that he has to argue over the basic difference between fractions of a cent and fractions of a dollar.\r\n\r\n7) You obviously think you are better than people who read Digg. I don't quite understand the \"then it's gay\" bit, but I'll chalk it up to the fact that your low intellect can't grasp the fact that calling stupid things \"gay\" is childish and old.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_u2uh","subreddit":"reddit.com","ups":14,"score":14,"created_utc":1165579376,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"crypticgeek","id":"cu3nr","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_cu3hn","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473808072,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"15790-cea3979e-3d7b-4716-8299-7e5e8ee20832-1566236763"}

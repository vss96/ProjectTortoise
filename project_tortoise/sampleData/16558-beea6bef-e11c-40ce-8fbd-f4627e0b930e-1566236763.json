They would need cranes, very heavy duty trucks and tools.  Probably a full machine shop.  The powder and shells would require enourmous storage and transport effort.  They need people with tools and supplies to maintain and probably even build railroad track.  They have locomotives that need their own support.  All of those support people need their own transportation and support.\r\n\r\nA weapon that large could easily require a batallion in total.  Perhaps the equivelent of a small brigade.\r\n\r\nConsider how many thousands of people were required to crew a navy battle ship of that era.  Most jobs would be similar.  Large engines, machine shops, large calibar guns, and all those people need their own support.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_u4cy","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"16558-beea6bef-e11c-40ce-8fbd-f4627e0b930e-1566236763"}

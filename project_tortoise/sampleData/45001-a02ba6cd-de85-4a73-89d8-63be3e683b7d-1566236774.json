Some of the very rich do come and rummage in the bins with the hoi polloi, though, hoping to spot designer clothes for a fraction of their original prices, but they're a very small minority.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine economy suffers in terms of lost taxation (I wonder if these used clothing importers pay any customs duties at all and if the store owners themselves remit any sales taxes to the government). But for a person who earns 5,000 pesos (100 US dollars) a month, a pair of jeans from the \"ukay-ukay\" that costs 100 pesos is really preferable to a brand new pair that costs 1,400 pesos (or a whopping 28% of his monthly income!) at the mall.\r\n\r\nThe best bargain is, of course, for people to get these donated clothes without having to spend a single centavo, as the original donors intended.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nSome clothing retailers here have adapted to the situation by replacing their brand new merchandise with used clothes. So now you see \"ukay-ukay\" shops all over the country. I'm sure the local garment industry must be feeling the crunch from its decreasing local market. And they're still reeling from the after-effects of WTO's garment quota reductions.","retrieved_on":1473809176,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_vo79","id":"cvpyi","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"45001-a02ba6cd-de85-4a73-89d8-63be3e683b7d-1566236774"}

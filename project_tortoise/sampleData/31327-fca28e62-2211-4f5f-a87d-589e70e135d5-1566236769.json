In addition, while in retrospect it's possible to cast it in the light of \"this is not Haskell advocacy\", the phrasing of the thing was actually anything but clear on that point.  If he had said something like \"This is not intended to portray Haskell as a universally better language, but merely to point out that the code in Haskell is so close to a direct transcription of the mathematical Fibonacci expression that it makes a good example of how the 'language of the future' should look when handling Fibonacci sequences,\" maybe it wouldn't look like advocacy.

Here is some education.\r\n\r\nPeak Oil can be easily understood via the scientific prediction that proved the theory. \r\n\r\n1) In 1930, oil discovery in America peaked. \r\n\r\n2) In the 1950's and 60's, M King Hubbert noticed that the average time between the discovery of an oil well and its \"topping out\" of production is 40 years. \r\n\r\n3) Therefore, he theorized, the entire US would peak in oil production in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe US peaked in oil production in 1970 and has been producing less and less each an every year, no matter how many billions that Oil Companies spent trying to raise production. Hubbert's scientific theory is correct and proven. It is simply impossible for it to be \"a scam.\"\r\n\r\nWorld oil discovery peaked in the 1960. Hence we should expect world oil peaking around.... well soon. Now how bad the consequences of this will be is up for debate. That peak will happen is not up for debate.\r\n","controversiality":0,"retrieved_on":1473807996,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"id":"ctzk3","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_ctuz6","author":"entropyfails","author_flair_text":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236762,"message_id":"13862-cf90211d-ee0f-4f4f-af11-fb684e44d9b2-1566236762"}

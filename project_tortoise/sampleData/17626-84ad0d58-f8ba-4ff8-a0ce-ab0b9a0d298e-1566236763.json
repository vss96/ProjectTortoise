{"controversiality":0,"body":"You have a valid point, but I disagree.  I think there are many benefits to living on the moon instead of in a space station.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, unless the space station is really large, rotating it won't provide the same gravity between your feet and your head.  Do you really want to live somewhere that your feet feel normal but your head feels really light?\r\n\r\nIf the station is huge enough, that's not a problem, but then you have lots of other issues such as construction, maintainence, and neighbors.  A station big enough to support a colony has to be pretty much complete before anyone can move in.  Construction in 0 gravity is pretty damn hard too.\r\n\r\nA lunar base can be built as people arrive.  It can be modular, using the giant tin cans that held the fuel to get to the moon.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't *have* to be incredibly expensive to build a lunar base.","link_id":"t3_u5vc","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","subreddit":"science","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1165629420,"score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"nosoupforyou","parent_id":"t1_cu6e2","edited":false,"id":"cu70h","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473808136,"distinguished":null,"timestamp_epoch":1566236763,"message_id":"17626-84ad0d58-f8ba-4ff8-a0ce-ab0b9a0d298e-1566236763"}

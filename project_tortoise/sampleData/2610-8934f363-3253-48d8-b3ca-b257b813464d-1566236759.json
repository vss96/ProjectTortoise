She can make us both really good sirloin steak, salad, and a pasta or soup dish for less than $10, whereas we just spent $17 tonight going out for Chinese buffet.  I personally can't cook very well at all, so I just assumed that any meal had to cost me $5 or more.  I now use the George Foreman Grill (a great thing) and never go out for burgers anymore, because I can make 100% beef 1/4-lb burgers, unlike McDonald's, for about $1, in less time than it takes to drive there.  You can actually eat pretty well for about $5 a day if you can cook.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_t9us","timestamp_epoch":1566236759,"message_id":"2610-8934f363-3253-48d8-b3ca-b257b813464d-1566236759"}

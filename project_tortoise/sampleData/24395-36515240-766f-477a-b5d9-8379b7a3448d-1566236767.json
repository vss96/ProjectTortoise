Lifeforms are adapted to seek/produce such ecosystems.  Success in this is associated with reward.  Beauty is a manifestation of this reward.  Art is synthetic beauty.\r\n\r\nThis natural \"complexity\" isn't well defined/understood (Gell-Mann, Kauffman), but there is something universal about Occam's razor (Solomonoff, Vitanyi, Schmidhuber, Hutter).\r\n\r\nEntropy/information content is relative (uncomputability of Kolmogorov complexity), but the human sensory organs provide a context (though not a standard against which voting by audience members is meaningful), as does the common experience of living in society.  The context of art is therefore also cultural.\r\n\r\nAudience isn't a good criterion.  Some art forms have evolved depth and subtlety that requires more practice to appreciate than we should expect of a large audience.  Just as planting eucalyptus in California isn't the great idea it may seem to be at first.  Even if an individual can control for brand and tricks, most individuals do not, making it hard to measure with this criterion in practice.  Also, the audience for a work can change abruptly over the course of history, making the measure of a work's value uncertain at any given time.\r\n\r\nEven if an objective definition of natural complexity were to be agreed upon, the context in which artistic information exists (human sensory signal processing, cultural experiences) is hard to describe precisely and differs from person to person.  So beauty remains in the eye of the beholder, even though there's an objective process behind it, and even though humans will often agree about the quality of a work (especially if they belong to a clique of humans who have mastered the skills necessary to appreciate the work).\r\n\r\n-Carl\r\nhttp://lumma.org\r\n","timestamp_epoch":1566236767,"message_id":"24395-36515240-766f-477a-b5d9-8379b7a3448d-1566236767"}

I am *also* certain that exposing youth to racism *perpetuates* racism, hurts inter-racial relations, and harms psychological development at least as much as any other form of abuse.\r\n\r\n&gt;Most middle-class blacks have some experience with racism and don't want their children to be shocked by it, but instead, learn to deal with it.\r\n\r\nWouldn't a broad history lesson and a more focused family history lesson serve the same purpose of preventing the 'shock' of it and instilling the self-respect and pride that is necessary to 'deal with it' in a *constructive, healthy* fashion, without the hurt and desire for vindication that would come from direct exposure?\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Forgot to mention:\r\n\r\n&gt;socialized into what itâ€™s like to be **black** in a **racist society**\r\n\r\nThat is critically important phrasing.  It immediately sets up an adversarial relationship between the *whole of society* and blacks, with blacks being the victims.

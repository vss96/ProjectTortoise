The supposed claim that using a cell phone during flight could endanger the plane MUST be utter and complete nonsense\r\n\r\nA friend who works in aviation tried to explain this to me. Apparently it can slightly throw off calibration the system that communicates the plane's position during take-offs and landings. After several 'bumps', the plane may be a foot or two out of alignment and needs to be re-calibrated. It seems to be mainly a matter of wanting to maintain large margins of error.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_vmrw","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473809151,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"id":"cvol0","parent_id":"t1_cvo45","edited":false,"timestamp_epoch":1566236774,"message_id":"44289-d29f03f1-04bd-4c6a-be95-8b0761c4ffe8-1566236774"}
